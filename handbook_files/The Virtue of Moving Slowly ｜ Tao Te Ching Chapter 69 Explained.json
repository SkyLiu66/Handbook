            "Knowledge Point": "The importance of flexibility and retreat in achieving success",
            "Text": "There is an old saying, it is better to become the passive in order to see what will happen. It is better to retreat a foot than to advance only an inch. This is called being flexible while advancing, pushing back without using force, and destroying the enemy without engaging him."

            "Knowledge Point": "Underestimating your enemy can lead to losing your greatest asset",
            "Text": "There is no greater disaster than underestimating your enemy. Underestimating your enemy means losing your greatest asset."

            "Knowledge Point": "The value of sorrow and patience in achieving victory",

            "Knowledge Point": "The concept of Wu Wei and the importance of going slow to see the path ahead",
            "Text": "The paragraph that really stood out to me in this chapter was the first one that talks about how it is better to retreat a foot than to advance only an inch. This is one of the main underlying ideas behind Wu Wei, the idea that going forward isn't always the most optimal option. Sometimes it's better to move slowly until the right moment."

            "Knowledge Point": "The benefits of diversifying experiences rather than specializing early in one's career",
            "Text": "We seek to specialize early in our careers because we see it as the quickest path to success, but this isn't always the case. In the talk, Epstein shares an example of a study on comic book creators, where researchers tried to determine what factors make a creator more likely to create a blockbuster comic. The interesting result of the study was that they discovered that the most influential variable was how many genres the creator had worked across."

        {
            "Knowledge Point": "The importance of intuition and trusting one's inner voice",
            "Text": "The most important thing, in my opinion, is to listen to your intuition. Don't do something just because everybody else is doing it, or because it seems like the normal thing. Take the time to engage with your intuition and feel what the right step is."

        {
            "Knowledge Point": "The value of taking things slower for smoother execution and fewer mistakes",
            "Text": "There's a saying that you hear a lot in athletics, slow is speed. Smooth is fast. I believe this saying comes from the Navy SEALS. The meaning behind this is that if you're willing to take things a bit slower, it pays off in the long run by allowing you to do things more smoothly, which helps prevent you from making as many mistakes."

            "Text": "He who follows the Tao is at one with the Tao. He who is virtuous experiences virtue. He who loses the way is lost. When you are at one with the Tao, the Tao welcomes you. When you are at one with virtue, the virtue is always there. When you are at one with loss, the loss is experienced willingly."

            "Text": "He who does not trust enough will not be trusted. Chapter 23 of the Tao Te Ching says an awful lot with just a few lines, from the benefits of talking less, to virtue, to becoming one with loss. And although I wish I had time to break down the whole chapter, I'm just going to focus on one theme for today, the art of giving up everything."

Lao Tzu talks about being one with loss. Now this is one of those parts of the Tao Te Ching that will read a little bit differently depending on whose translation you are using."

As far as becoming one with loss, I found one translation that rendered this line as... Those who are one with deprivation are deprived of deprivation. I found this really interesting."

The person who obstinately withholds things from the universe is usually required to give up more and more. The person who willingly offers all that he or she has is often allowed to keep it, because he or she understands that it's not really theirs anyway."

To assert that we can lay some kind of ownership to materials, land, or time that was here before we were, will exist long after we are gone, and of which we are powerless to create or destroy even the tiniest particle, must sound frankly hilarious to the Daoist perspective."

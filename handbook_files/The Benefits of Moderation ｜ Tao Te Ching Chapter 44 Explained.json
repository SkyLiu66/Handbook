            "Text": "Taoism teaches us to learn to let go of the things we desire, even the things we already have in love. It's not that we get rid of them, but we hold on to them loosely, understanding and accepting that they could be taken away from us at any time."

            "Text": "Learning to be content is almost more of a process of unlearning a lifetime of habits and thought patterns than it is learning a new skill. We have to learn to see things differently and to stop putting emphasis on the things held dear by the people around us."

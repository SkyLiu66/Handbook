In order to truly act rightly, we need to become changed by coming into harmony with a force higher and greater than ourselves. Then we will act rightly, not because we are trying hard to, but because we are trying to and we are not trying to."

But as a natural result of coming more in harmony with Tao, and by so doing, becoming one with all things."

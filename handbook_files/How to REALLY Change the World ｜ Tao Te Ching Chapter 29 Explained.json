            "Text": "We often overlook the things that we have the greatest ability to change. For example, I may be seriously concerned about wars or unrest in other states or countries, and so I may attempt to start a society or a fundraiser or post on social media to raise awareness, but all of these things ultimately would be attempts by myself to change a situation far away from me which frankly I know very little about, compared to those who are actually there experiencing it."

            "Knowledge Point": "Real, lasting change starts from within and spreads outward.",
            "Text": "The most important duty we have if we want to improve our lives is to be able to do what we want to do. To improve the world is to improve ourselves. As we do this, our goodness will spread to our inner circles, to our families, to our communities, our countries, and from there to the entire world."

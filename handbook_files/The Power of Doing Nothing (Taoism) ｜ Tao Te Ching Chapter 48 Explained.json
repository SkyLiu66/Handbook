The interface was uncluttered and easy to navigate. The hardware was black, white, or gray. Period. The lure of Apple products was almost less about what they had and more about what they didn't have."

            "Text": "The best jokes are told by not trying too hard to be funny. The best solutions to problems are often not found during brainstorm sessions, but when one isn't thinking about the problem at all, like when you're showering or taking a nap.

            "Text": "In order to become one with Tao, we must discard the lessons we have learned throughout life that have contributed to our separation from Tao and from all things.

The Way, with a capital W. This way is found by putting aside our desires, working softness and quietness into our days and into our attitudes, and by being responsive to the pushes and pulls of our intuition."

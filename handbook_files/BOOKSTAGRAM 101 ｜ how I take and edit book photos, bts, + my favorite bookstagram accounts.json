            "Text": "I did a little question box a few days ago on my Instagram asking if anybody had any requests for video ideas on my YouTube channel, like book videos. I had a couple of people request a book photo behind the scenes and then I had someone request book photography tutorials. I posted on my story the response and asked if people would want to see that and they said yes. It's very majority voted that they wanted to see that. So that's what we're going to be doing today."

A lot of times if I'm just taking a photo of a book, I will use my bed and I have like this perfect dreams blanket and my comforter and this other comforter and I will just set it there and take a photo."

            "Text": "One tip that I have is to angle the phone up or like this. Just the angle of the photo really changes how the photo is going to look. For example, if the book is like this, I'm trying to angle it with the book and not like this. I try to keep it at a good angle."

I use Photoshop, but I know there's an app you can use for this. I have a semi-knowledge of Photoshop to do that, so I edit on Photoshop."

My vibe is more like warm pinky tones, so I'll use the same preset on every single photo to create an aesthetic on my feed."

            "Text": "In any game of blackjack, for example, the outcome of the specific game is uncertain. A casino does not know whether it will win or lose any single game of blackjack. However, they do know that because of how the game works, they have a slightly higher chance of winning."

            "Knowledge Point": "The benefits of embracing uncertainty and thinking in probabilities",
            "Text": "A good trader never assumes that they can predict the outcome of any single event with certainty. Attempting to do so leads to recklessness and ruin. Instead, they opt to play the long game, knowing that while they can't predict the outcome of any single trade, their edge gives them a slight probabilistic advantage, but they can still win."

Just like the trader is profitable by knowing what he or she doesn't know, the sage is profitable by knowing what he or she doesn't know. The sage is whole by knowing where he or she is weak."

I know that will come as a disappointment to a lot of you, but to be honest, I think I've had enough of daily uploads for a while. This challenge has been an amazing experience, and I've learned so much from it, but I'm ready to move on."

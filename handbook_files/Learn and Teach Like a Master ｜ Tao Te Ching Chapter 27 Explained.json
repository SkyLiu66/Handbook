            "Text": "A good teacher should be patient, kind, and have love for the student. This will help the student to feel safe and comfortable in the learning environment, and will guide the teacher's teaching process to conform to the student's needs."

            "Text": "The Chinese word that is rendered here as good isn't really an exact translation. The word in Chinese is shun, which is used to denote skill or aptitude. The word that is here translated as bad is just the negative version of shun, denoting a lack of skill or aptitude."

            "Knowledge Point": "The role of a master",
            "Text": "A master is able to boil down a task to its absolute essentials, and then perfect each of these essentials to the point where they are flawless and automatic. As a person achieves mastery in his or her respective field, it then becomes their privilege and perhaps their obligation to pass this knowledge onward so that others may benefit from and improve upon it."
        },
        {
            "Knowledge Point": "The importance of simplicity",
            "Text": "A true master can often be identified by the unassuming simplicity with which they perform their task, and yet the results far outstrip those of everyone else. Showiness is not a sign of mastery."

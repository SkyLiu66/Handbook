      "Knowledge Point": "Modern brand marketing goes beyond just increasing brand awareness to defining a brand's identity and story.",
      "Text": "Modern brand marketing, however, goes far beyond that. It's evolved to include anything that defines a brand's identity, things like who you are, what you do, what makes you unique, what you do for a brand, and what you do for a brand. So let's get started. What is your personal story and what do you promise to your customer? Executing brand marketing well by engaging in strategic creative storytelling leaves audiences with a positive impression of your brand and can make people prefer your product or brand over others."

      "Knowledge Point": "Content marketing focuses on creating valuable content to attract and retain audiences, building trust over time.",
      "Text": "Content marketing is about creating valuable content to attract and retain a specific audience with the ultimate goal of driving customer engagement and action. It's about giving people what they want or need, and getting them to come back to the well again and again. Then they discover your brand along the way and hopefully consider you a trusted authority in the market. Content marketing is the polar opposite of forcing a hard sell. It's about creating content that educates, entertains or inspires without overtly trying to sell anything."

            "Knowledge Point": "Short-form videos should be authentic, engaging, and optimized for each platform's ideal metrics.",
            "Text": "Depending on the social media platform, there are different strategies for what short-form video actually looks and feels like. Each platform contains different ideal metrics for length, format, style, and target audience. A slickly produced two-minute video on YouTube might capture millions of views, but it wouldn't be right for TikTok. There are lots of marketing sites that tout all sorts of recommendations for social media video, and these are changing and evolving all the time."

            "Knowledge Point": "Repurposing content across multiple platforms can be an effective strategy for maximizing reach.",
            "Text": "That said, brands often find the most success when they have a strategy for repurposing content across multiple platforms. It's often about crafting your message around a main theme or idea. You take that idea, you turn it into a YouTube video. That YouTube video is long-form content. We can use a software to audio transcribe that and turn it into a blog post. You can take that YouTube video and you can cut it down into vertical sections. The first three verticals go on TikTok, but there's six more in there that you could put on Reels."

            "Knowledge Point": "The marketing funnel concept applies to short-form video, with content tailored for each stage.",
            "Text": "Through all of this, we need to consider the marketing funnel, where content at the top is positioned to capture awareness and generate interest. Then comes consideration, where you engage your audience further so they learn more about your brand. Then there's decision, where you create content that gets your audience to respond to your call to action. And finally, there's retention, content created to keep your existing customers satisfied. TikTok and Instagram Reels videos tend to do well throughout the marketing funnel."

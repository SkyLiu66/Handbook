            "Knowledge Point": "The difference between Taoist self-improvement and conventional self-improvement",
            "Text": "Taoism teaches us to be soft, but it does not teach us to be weak. On the contrary, the Tao Te Ching instructs us to improve ourselves as much as we possibly can. It's just that self-improvement for a Taoist often looks quite different from the self-improvement we see all around us in the rest of the world."

            "Text": "In meditation, we don't try to do this. We allow the mind to do whatever it wants to do. We just choose not to engage with it as it does so. We simply watch the thoughts come and go without dwelling on them."

            "Text": "Desires are part of our basic biology. Our brains are literally wired to desire things. And it's a good thing too, because these mechanisms keep us alive by pushing us to acquire what is needed for our daily survival."

            "Knowledge Point": "Desires can get out of hand, leading to a constant state of being dominated by them.",

            "Knowledge Point": "Surrendering to the possibility of getting the opposite of what we want can lead to increased peace of mind and understanding.",
            "Text": "Chapter 22 of the Tao Te Ching offers advice on how to avoid this. The recipe is simple. If you really want something, first allow yourself to be reconciled. Surrender yourself to the possibility of getting the exact opposite of whatever it is that you want."

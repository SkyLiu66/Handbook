            "Text": "Self-awareness is an extremely important concept in Taoism. Understanding the workings of society, people, and science is certainly valuable. However, if we chase these kinds of intellectual pursuits without taking time to understand the person behind our own eyelids, we will run into problems."

            "Knowledge Point": "The challenges of self-knowledge",
            "Text": "Understanding of the self is a very important concept in Taoism. Understanding the self takes time and life experience, and there are some dangers we run into with regards to self-knowledge."

        {
            "Knowledge Point": "The dangers of self-knowledge",
            "Text": "One danger we run into is that sometimes we think we're practicing self-knowledge when we are actually just making our minds up not to change."

            "Knowledge Point": "The importance of learning and growth",
            "Text": "We don't have to become experts in everything we do, but the human brain can't do that. We can't just be a bunch of people who can't learn a remarkable amount of things if we give it a fair chance."

            "Knowledge Point": "The dangers of denial and false assumptions",
            "Text": "Most people walk around in massive amounts of denial about something, but usually about many things. We are highly incentivized not to really understand ourselves for many reasons, but one thing that makes it so hard is the baggage we pick up over our lives."
        },
        {
            "Knowledge Point": "The importance of understanding oneself",
            "Text": "True self-awareness is difficult, partly because we view ourselves through the lens of what we have learned over the course of our lives as good or bad."
        },
        {
            "Knowledge Point": "The dangers of false positive assumptions",
            "Text": "We also walk around with lots of false positive assumptions as well, often because of our need to feel like we are a good person and because of the lessons we learned early in life about what a good person is."
        },
        {
            "Knowledge Point": "The importance of understanding oneself in harmony with Tao",
            "Text": "The best way to come to really know ourselves is to draw closer to the Tao, which contains understanding of all selves and all things. The more in harmony with Tao, the more we will be able to understand ourselves, and the more we will be able to understand ourselves."

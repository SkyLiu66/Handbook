            "Text": "In this chapter, we discuss the dangers of excess and the wisdom of knowing when enough is enough. The law of diminishing returns, a concept used in various fields, states that there comes a point where further investment of resources yields diminishing returns. For example, a factory owner may find that adding more workers does not efficiently utilize the available work, resulting in wasted effort and resources."

            "Text": "Laozi provides examples of diminishing returns in daily life, such as drinking from a full cup, using a sharp knife, and amassing wealth. Our brains often associate more of a good thing with better outcomes, but this is not always the case. There comes a point when enough is just enough."

            "Knowledge Point": "Balancing perfectionism and productivity",
            "Text": "In my experience, striving for perfection can lead to procrastination and stress. Adopting a 'done is better than perfect' approach allows for consistent progress and improvement. Knowing when to call a project complete is a valuable life skill."

            "Knowledge Point": "The benefits and drawbacks of knowledge are complex, as demonstrated by Fritz Haber's story.",
            "Text": "Probably one of the biggest issues with knowledge is that it is not always the same. It often leads to pride and self-righteousness. When we think that we know a good deal about things, we often try to play God with them. And this can lead to terrible results."

            "Knowledge Point": "Fritz Haber's invention of nitrogen fertilizers had both positive and negative consequences.",
            "Text": "You should go and watch this video if you have some free time, because I think it's really worth taking a look at. Haber was prompted towards this invention by a panic caused by the realization that global population growth was beginning to outstrip the government. It's probably that this invention prevented an incalculably disastrous human crisis. In fact, it's estimated that around half of all people alive today simply could not have been if nitrogen fertilizers had never been invented."

            "Knowledge Point": "Fritz Haber later invented chemical weapons with devastating consequences.",
            "Text": "However, the story isn't all that black and white, because Fritz Haber later brought forth another invention that had a dramatic impact on humanity. Chlorine, phosphine, and mustard gas. If you know even a little bit about World War I, you'll know that being exposed to these kinds of gases was one of the most horrific things a soldier could experience in battle."

        {
            "Knowledge Point": "Fritz Haber justified the use of chemical weapons, but they ultimately caused more harm than good.",
            "Text": "Chlorine gas damages the air tract, causing buildup of fluid in the lungs, and eventually can cause a person to basically drown on dry land. Mustard gas causes severe chemical burns wherever it touches skin or tissue. Both are terrible ways to die. Haber justified the research and use of chemical weapons because he claimed that the quick and decisive victory they would ensure would in the long term save thousands of lives. However, he was wrong. Chemical weapons were used by both sides and did not prove decisive for either."

            "Knowledge Point": "Fritz Haber's invention of a pesticide gas variant was later used in the Holocaust.",
            "Text": "Unfortunately, this is one of those genies that never really gets back into the bottle. The tragedy doesn't even end there, however, because the Nazis later used a variant of pesticide gas invented by Haber to exterminate millions of Jews during the Holocaust. Fritz Haber was himself a Jew."

            "Knowledge Point": "Knowledge is a double-edged sword, as demonstrated by Fritz Haber's story.",
            "Text": "Now, breaking this all down, I think we need to be careful about making judgments about people who we have never met and who lived under circumstances we never experienced. But I think this sobering story can serve as a pretty stark warning about how knowledge is a bit of a two-edged sword."

        {
            "Knowledge Point": "Knowledge should be paired with intuition and closeness to Dao to avoid negative consequences.",
            "Text": "We shouldn't assume that greater knowledge always leads to greater outcomes. Knowledge is dangerous if it's not paired with intuition and a closeness with Dao."

            "Knowledge Point": "Nitrogen fertilizers have both positive and negative impacts on the environment.",
            "Text": "You know how Fritz Haber invented those fertilizers that saved all those people? Well, even this invention isn't without downsides. I personally used to live within miles of a lake where these kinds of fertilizers leaked over time and nearly destroyed an entire ecosystem. Fertilizers may allow vastly increased production of food, but they can also have really terrible impacts on the environment."

            "Knowledge Point": "The best approach is to stay close to intuition and make informed decisions.",
            "Text": "Now, to bring this all back to the chapter, I guess I really don't have a conclusion to give you guys about it. I think I'd rather have you form your own opinion here. Is it better for a people to be educated or kept in ignorance? Knowledge certainly has a lot of dangers. However, on the other hand, despotic governments are often able to do what they do largely by keeping their subjects in ignorance. Maybe the benefits of knowledge outweigh the cost. What I'm really trying to do here is give you guys some food for thought and to impress upon you that there are costs for ignorance as well as costs for knowledge. Everything comes at a cost. Maybe there is no right answer. Maybe there is a lesser of two evils. You're gonna have to decide that for yourself."

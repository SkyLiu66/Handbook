            "Text": "The Tao of Heaven is like the bending of a bow. What is high is brought down. What is low is sent high. What's excessive is reduced. What's insufficient is increased. The Tao of Heaven takes from those who have too much and gives to those who are in want."

            "Text": "We've talked a lot in this series so far about how the sage takes the needs of others and treats them like his or her own. Lao Tzu speaks of the bending of a bow. When a bow is drawn, the top and bottom are both drawn toward the middle. What is high is made low and what is low is made high."

            "Text": "I don't think this image is only some kind of economic theory. While this idea certainly can't apply to helping those who are economically disadvantaged, it can apply to everything we do. Whatever we have a lot of, whether that be money, talent, knowledge, even humor, we can share this gift with others."

            "Knowledge Point": "The question of whether anyone can share abundantly with the world.",
            "Text": "Everyone has something more abundantly than those around him or her. Whatever it is we are abundant in, these things have value to others and should be shared. With all that said, Lao Tzu poses this question. Is there anybody who has abundantly enough to share their excess with the whole world? Is this even possible?"

            "Knowledge Point": "The sage understands the importance of aligning with Tao and sharing abundantly.",

        {
            "Knowledge Point": "The sage acts without seeking praise or recognition, focusing on emulating Tao.",
            "Text": "Thus, he or she is focused on being one with Tao. And when this is done, he enjoys the increased capacity that the Tao brings. Because he does not desire to have more than others, he is not concerned with praise or taking credit for what he does."

Though they have boats and carriages, no one uses them. Though they have armor and weapons, no one displays them. Men return to the knotting of rope in place of writing. Their food is plain and good. Their clothes, fine but simple. Their homes, secure. They are happy in their ways. Though they live within sight of their neighbors, and crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way, yet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die. In this chapter, it seems that we get a bit of a look into Lao Tzu's ideal world. We see glimpses of a country where people are not rushed, and where they embrace the simplicity in life, and don't have a need to travel to different places. People renounce war and live in peace. Many political, economic, and philosophical theories have been made on how this could be achieved. However, every known attempt at a utopian society has failed, because they just keep running up against the same old problem of human nature. You can have the best social or economic theories around, but inevitably some chump is just gonna ruin it for everyone. Or, you know, just kind of everyone ruins it for everyone. All that aside though, this doesn't mean that there aren't things that we can do to introduce more peace, simplicity, and self-sufficiency into our lives. I made a whole 12 minute video on simplifying our lives, which I'll link in the description, and actually I think it's one of my better ones, so you should really go watch it. It's probably not feasible for all of us to go live on homesteads, as nice as that would be. But there are things we can do to get ourselves more in touch with nature and natural simplicity. For example, a lot of communities have allotment programs. For example, a lot of communities have allotment programs. These are usually quite affordable, and they sometimes even have people available to train you on how to garden, if you don't know anything about it. If you don't want to garden, one simple thing you can do is take regular time to get out in nature. Just find a spot where you can be alone and outside with as much nature as possible. If the only accessible nature you have is a city park, then fine, use that. We spend so much time being overstimulated by our endless consumption of media and noise. Our brains really aren't designed for this. It's only in the last hundred years that humans have been able to understand the nature of nature. It's only in the last hundred years that humans have been able to understand the nature of nature. It's only in the last hundred years that humans have ever had any kind of screen to look at at all. That's nowhere near enough time for our bodies and brains to evolve. The pace of our changing world has begun to seriously outstrip the pace at which our bodies can adapt to it. It's important to have at least some time during the day where you can touch grass and put your brain at rest. As much as we can, we should try to simplify our lives and be content with this simplicity. We run our lives at a breakneck pace and then try and plan vacations in order to wind back down. But what if we just tried to cultivate lives that are not as simple as we think? But what if we just tried to cultivate lives that are not as simple as we think? What if we just tried to cultivate lives that we didn't feel like we needed vacations from? What if we could just simplify our lives to the point that they weren't so exhausting? This will probably look different for different people, but just try and consider if there are things in your life that you could off-board to make it a little less hectic. In life, there are good things, better things, and best things. We have a tendency to put off the best things so that we can pack in more good things. This is obviously backwards. We need to cut down on the good things so that we can have room for the best things. We need enough unstimulated time in our lives so that we can be open to hearing our intuitions. Intuition will help us to know what things in our lives are most important. Thank you for watching. Come and join the Discord if you want to discuss the chapter more in depth, and I will see you all tomorrow for the final chapter of the Tao Te Ching. Peace and blessings.",

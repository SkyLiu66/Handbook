And I'm going to do something a little bit different for this one. So we'll go ahead and do that same movement and I'm going to move down as he's doing it. So go ahead. Perfect. Okay perfect. So I did a transition down with him as he was pressing down and we're going to use the wipe from this table for me to use as a transition into the next shot. The next shot is going to be pouring. So let's get you a cup buddy. So I came down under the table. Now I want to match that same exact movement into the beginning of the next shot. The next shot to make a seamless cut using camera movement and kind of that wipe effect. It'll make sense when you see these two cut together. So we're going to take a moment to what's called block this out where you work with the person who's doing the camera work and then you work with the talent in front of the camera to set up the movement correct for the shot. So flats what I want to kind of do is like the cameras here. I'm like this and you like wipe down and then like ninja status. Okay. So I'm going to do it a few times without you pouring. Okay, go ahead. Okay, so I kind of want to move everything a little bit out of the way because we're doing a little bit of a wider. We're not going to be shooting this at 70 because there's movement happening and I want to keep everything in frame as much as possible. So we'll go ahead. Yeah, I mean this will be the real first real deal test. Go ahead. Okay. That was a pretty heavy pour bro, but I think that'll look good. I really like that one but we're going to do with stuff like this where it's your ending shot of your montage or your video. You want to make sure you nail it. So we're going to do that one again. Yeah, that needs to be lined up. Okay, go ahead. So. Okay. Okay. Okay. So that's that. Amazing ending shot by Vlads. Now I'm going to cut these shots together, add the slow motion, do a little bit of stabilization and we're going to see what the final product of these raw shots look like. Okay. Okay. Okay. compared to the final edit where we kind of add that little gloss and refinement of all the tools and tips that we learned so far in this course to these b-wall shots for your montage and here is that final edit so yeah you know this realization hit me earlier today it's it's kind of it's hard to say yeah it's hard it's hard to say but i am addicted to coffee i just love the entire experience of it those lovely textured beans and then brewing it when you pour that piping hot water over those freshly ground beans you know what and then sometimes i feel like maybe i don't need this maybe this is something that i should stop indulging yeah you know what i think i'm gonna stop today yeah on second thought i think i'm gonna get a second cup yeah boy",

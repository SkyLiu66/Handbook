It's not a giant grand illusion where five people go into a box and the box is hauled up and then there are fireworks and then they're gone. It's that thing where somebody shows you that their hands are empty and then they cover it. And then when they reveal it again, there's a rose there. You go, how did they do that? Was the rose always there? The rose must have been there. I once wrote a book of short stories for children. I'm just going to read you my very short introduction. When I was young, and it doesn't really seem that long ago, I loved books of short stories. Short stories could be read from start to finish in the kinds of times I had available for reading, morning break or after lunch nap or on trains. They'd set up, they'd roll, and they'd take you to a new world and deliver you safely back to school or back home in half an hour or so. Stories of short stories. The stories you read when you're the right age never quite leave you. You may forget who wrote them or what the story was called. Sometimes you'll forget precisely what happened, but if a story touches you, it will stay with you, haunting the places in your mind that you rarely ever visit. Horror stays with you hardest. If it brings a real chill to the back of your neck, if once the story is done, you find yourself closing the book slowly for fear of disturbing something and creeping away, then it's there for the rest of time. There was a story I read when I was nine that ended with a room covered with snails. I think they were probably man-eating snails, and they were crawling slowly towards someone to eat him. I get the same creeps remembering it now that I did when I read it. Fantasy gets into your bones. There's a curve in a road I sometimes pass, a view of a village on rolling green hills, and behind it, huger, craggier, grayer hills, and in the distance, mountains and mist that I cannot see without remembering reading The Lord of the Rings. The book is somewhere inside me, and that view brings it to the surface. And science fiction takes you across the stars and into other times and minds. There's nothing like spending some time inside an alien head to remind us how little divides us, person from person. Short stories are tiny windows into other worlds and other minds and other dreams. They're journeys you can make to the far side of the universe and still be back in time for dinner. I've been writing short stories for almost a quarter of a century now. In the beginning, they were a great way to begin to learn my craft as a writer. The hardest thing to do as a young writer is to finish something, and that was what I was learning how to do. These days, most of the things I write are long, long comics or long books or long films, and a short story, something that's finished and over in a weekend or a week, is pure fun. My favorite short story writers as a boy are many of them my favorite short story writers now. People like Saki or Harlan Ellison, like John Collier or Shirley Jackson or Ray Bradbury, close-up conjurers who with just 26 letters and a handful of punctuation marks could make you laugh and break your heart, all in the handful of pages. There's another good thing about a book of short stories, you don't have to like them all. If there's one you don't even know, if there's one you enjoy, well, there'll be another one along soon. And I named the book, this book, after a Ray Bradbury book. When I was a boy, Ray Bradbury picked stories from his books of short stories he thought younger readers might like, and he published them as R is for rocket and S is for space. Now, I was doing the same sort of thing, and I asked Ray if he'd mind if I called this book M is for magic. He didn't. M. J. B is for magic. All the letters are, if you put them together properly, you can make magic with them and dreams. And I hope even a few surprises. One of my favorite short story writers is the late Roger Zelazny. I encountered Zelazny's short stories first as a nine-year-old, a 10-year-old, and then the ones that came between that and this Oront Amendment, all of the short stories I told him. I'd only known him because he was a tiny, little kid. And Saul Rosen Bürger, which was left-handed brother of mine, said things like, He's my everything. And this is not what I want. He was writing this long-term or long-term thing, And I loved them. I loved his books. I loved his stories. I loved his characters, these angst-ridden people or super-competent people or just people in situations that had them at the end of their tether. I loved his use of language. He could really deploy words beautifully. Selazny was a poet, and he wrote his fiction, and he wrote a short story writing. Like a poet, with a poet's eye and ear for the precision of the right word in the right place. And I didn't get to meet Roger until I was in my late 20s writing Sandman. And we didn't really get to talk until I was 30. And I was at the World Fantasy Convention in Tucson, Arizona. And I ran into Roger and sat down with him and said, Roger, will you talk to me about writing short stories? Because you do it better than anyone I know. And just tell me about writing short stories. And he stopped for a bit, and he thought. And then he said, you know, really? He said, oh, one of my best short stories. The last chapter of a novel I didn't write. And I loved that. I really took that to heart. Because when you're writing short fiction, what you want, whether it's true or not, is to feel like these characters didn't just start to exist the moment the story began. You want to know. They've all been in existence all along. You want to know that things have happened to them. Things have taken them to this point. And now we are at the point of heightened emotion. We're at the point where the plot is actually kicking in. This is the thing you've been waiting all of that time for. This is the denouement. This is the unraveling time. This is the time when we're all going, we're all going to understand everything. And it's the last chapter. It's the final chunk of a novel that you haven't had to write. And I always thought that was such a wonderful way in to short story writing. And also, because I am fundamentally lazy, it's a lovely sort of headway into a short story. You go, well, look, I write this short story. There's 130,000 words I don't have to write. I can just write this 8,000 words and that puts it all into place. So I like doing that too. One of the fun things to do when you're a young writer and you are just writing a short story, and frankly, any writer writing a short story, I say, well, if you're being a big singing star in aилиy's o статьoth of the leakst pun in an o ritual in West States, oh, we can do it. I'm persuading. This is happy kind of thing. In fact, technically, I've written one exactly 100-word short story called Nicholas Was. Let's see, do we have a smoke and mirrors here? Nicholas was older than sin, and his beard could grow no whiter. He wanted to die. The dwarfish natives of the Arctic caverns did not speak his language, but conversed in their own twittering tongue, conducted incomprehensible rituals when they were not actually working in the factories. Once every year they forced him, sobbing and protesting, into endless night. During the journey, he would stand near every child in the world, leave one of the dwarves' invisible gift, and then pass by its bedside. The children slept, frozen into time. He envied Prometheus and Loki, Sisyphus and Judas. His punishment was harsher. Ho, ho, ho. It's a very, very short story. But I learned things from it. I learned a lot. I learned about compression. I learned how to make the penny drop. Part of the fun of that story is where in the story do you figure that Nicholas was Santa Claus? Where do you figure, where do you learn that this is the punishment of Father Christmas? And so it's just a small thing. The glory of a short story, too, is just one thing has to happen. In novels, lots of things happen. A novel has to be about lots and lots of different things. A story, a short story, really only has to be about one thing. You can say that one thing. Then you can stop, get on to something else. Short fiction is a fantastic place to learn your craft as a writer. A lot of writers, when they're writing, a lot of writers, when they think that they want to set out, sail their first craft out onto the seas of story, immediately get the idea that you should go huge. You should write a series of ten books and have a huge mega plot. And you should have a cast of thousands and all of these things. And there's a lot of skills that you need to do that and to do it successfully. Even those writers who have done that have tended to have to learn their craft as they go, book by book in progression. What's lovely is taking short journeys, is taking your boat out and just going round the headland. And coming back in time for tea. Learning skills. So a short story is lovely. It's 3,000 words, 4,000 words, 2,000 words, 5,000 words. You can do that in a day or a weekend or a week or two weeks. You can have an idea for a book. You can have a story. You can have an idea for something. You can take it out. You can succeed or you can fail. Or you can learn things. But all of the things that you learn, whether you succeed or you fail, the important thing is that you just took the boat out. The important thing is that you wrote something. The important thing is that you learned. And that's the place where you get to master new skills. That's the place where you get to find out, okay, I have an idea. Can I make this thing happen? I have an idea for a tone of voice. Do I want to do that? Is this, would this thing work? I have an idea here for something that's slightly mad. You can start a short story just with the setup. You can start a short story just with the end. You can start a short story just with something that happens in the middle. And okay, well then start here. Go meet that thing that happens in the middle. And then follow it on and see where it goes. If it fails, it fails. That's okay. You've lost three days. You've lost a week. No big deal.",

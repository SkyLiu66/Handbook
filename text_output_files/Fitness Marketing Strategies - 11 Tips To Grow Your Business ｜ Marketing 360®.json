Do you want to grow your gym or your personal training business? I'm sure you do. Here's 11 tips on how you can execute some marketing beautifully to do just that. Tip number one is to build a beautiful website with some really beautiful branding. One of the first things people are going to do when they're researching where they want to go in terms of a gym or what personal trainer they might want to work with is they're going to take a look at your website. So your website really is your best salesperson. It never calls in sick. It can sell a thousand people at the exact same time. So take some time and invest in your brand and in your content. Have everything there that somebody might want to look at or understand about your brand in order to go with you. Because what they're going to do is they're going to compare your website with other websites in the area for gyms or personal trainers, and they're going to decide who to do business with based on the look and the content of that website. So focus on your website. And power tip here, check it on mobile. Most people are using their phones these days, so make sure you're signing up for that. And if you're not, then I would advise you to go ahead and check out other sites that have mobile. Tip number two is to build a strong social presence. Build your presence on Instagram and Facebook especially for gyms and personal trainers. You may even think about YouTube, but people are going to check for social proof before they decide to invest in your gym or in your personal training service. And they're going to want to see good content, educational content, interesting content show that you're passionate about what you do. And they're going to want to see that people are actually following you and engaging with you. If they see those things, they're going to have more trust and move forward to the next step. So if you're looking for a gym training, or if you're looking for something that's going to help you with your training, you should definitely check with them. But if you're looking for a gym training, which is doing business with you. Tip number three is to invest in video. Do videos all the time as a fitness brand. Make sure that you're posting that on social media. Video can be a hard thing to do sometimes if you're trying to think about what content to create on the spot. So an idea here is to write down the questions you hear every week. Your clients are gonna be asking you questions in the gym all the time. Write those down. Those are perfect ideas for videos. If you just create a video every week or two or three a week and just answer those simple questions, it's gonna be valuable information for people online that are watching and consuming that content. It's also gonna create brand awareness for you to help grow your brand and your fitness business. So that's one power tip. Another one there is also to do like a feature one client a week. Show their before, after. Talk about their story. Talk about what they enjoy about your brand. What makes you different? Share that content as well. This is great ways to have content ready to go all the time. A steady drip of content means a steady drip of new customers. Tip number four is to use a CRM. Stay. Get organized. Keep all of your clients listed in the CRM. Store information about them and their family and their goals. Follow up and check in with them and build in email automation that sends them automated tips and reminders, class schedules, workouts of the day, sends them fitness, nutritional information, those sorts of things. Send them holiday emails, birthday emails. Really build a relationship and use a CRM to store that information and then have a process to follow up with your clients to keep them engaged. A lot of times, people will trade trainers or trade gyms because they get disengaged. Stay. Follow up with them so that you earn them back if they do leave and more importantly, keep them there so they don't leave. Tip number five is to build your reputation online. You should have a lot of reviews. You should have a four or five star rating and a constant flow of reviews all the time. The more reviews you get, the more clients you're going to get. So ask for reviews from your happy clients. Here's an idea. Maybe offer them a free month if they leave reviews online. And have them leave reviews on more than just one review site. Ask them to leave it on the Google reviews, maybe on your Facebook reviews and all your other relevant review sites that you're passionate about so that when somebody searches your brand name and the word reviews on Google, the page is just lit up with four and five star reviews on multiple review sites. A lot of times before people decide who to do business with in any business, but especially a gym or a personal trainer, they're going to check your reviews online. And if you have a tremendous amount of reviews and a high star rating in comparison to your competitors, you're going to win the business. And so ask for reviews and give people a free month for doing it. Tip six is to optimize your local listings on directory sites. This is going to help you rank higher in the maps on Google search, but it's also going to help you rank high in relevant directories that people might also be looking online. There's personal trainer directories, there's gym directories. You're going to want to be listed highly on all of those because here's the deal. You can't control where people look, but you can control if you're there. And so you want to make sure that you're there and you're ranking on top. And so optimize, those profiles, ask for reviews on those profiles so that you're present there and you can capture business from every possible source. Tip seven is to dominate the first page of Google. When somebody searches your city name, gym or city name, personal trainer or other relevant keywords that could potentially drive you business, you want to dominate page one. You can dominate page one in three areas. You can be right on top and that's paid ads. So invest in paying to be on top. You also want to be high in the maps, which is right below that. If you're high on the maps, you're going to get a lot of business. And if you have a lot of reviews there, that helps. And then also you're going to want to rank high organically. And so build content on your site, blog on your site, do things are going to help you rank high organically so that you potentially own real estate in three positions on page one of Google. If you do that, you're going to grow your brand. Tip number eight is to do retargeting ads. Retargeting ads basically stay in front of people after they see you on social media or they go to your website. A lot of times before people decide, what gym to do business with or which personal trainer to hire, they're going to do research, right? They're kind of in research mode for a while, sometimes a week, two weeks, a month before they decide. And so you want to do retargeting so that you stay in front of those people during that research phase. This builds trust. And when they're ready to do business, they think of you first. Tip number nine is to run social targeting ads, build social targeting ad campaigns specifically for Instagram and also Facebook so that you're targeting people in your area that are interested in fitness. So that they become aware of your brand and they basically eventually do business with you. Now create video content, create engaging content, create educational content. Don't necessarily sell people in these ad campaigns, just provide value. This will build trust, create this passion inside of them to want to give you a try. Offer a free month to get people to come in and try or maybe a free class to just open the door to that conversation and then you'll win the business. Tip number 10 is to develop a corporate program and talk to the businesses nearby. And the organizations nearby and offer a discount if their employees or the members of their organizations work out at your gym or use you as a personal trainer. This is a great way to get nearby customer bases and offer a discount but maybe be able to do some group classes where you make your profit margins that you need. If you can get groups of people there and create maybe even specific classes and group events for these businesses and these organizations, you'll get additional buy-in and now as they grow those businesses and hire new employees, guess what? Now you also get a new client. Tip 11, last tip is increase the lifetime value of your customers. Try to get more revenue out of the clients that you have. If they're paying a monthly membership fee or hourly for your personal training service, how can you get additional revenue out of them? Well, you can do that a lot of ways. Maybe offering swag, selling them some shirts and some hats and if they're passionate about your brand, they'll buy that. Selling nutritional products, maybe powerful power bars or drinks can be helpful that you can provide. Maybe after they work out. And there's tons of other ways to do this and offer additional products and value that you can add on top of the revenue that you're receiving. If you could just get $100 a month more from each customer, think of what that does to your revenue. Even if it's just $100 a year more out of each customer, what does that do to your revenue? Well, it's huge and it's gonna help you grow your business and invest in marketing to grow your business even further. Bonus tip of the day, two parts. Think about running competitor ads. You can run Google search ads and social media ads. You can run Google search ads and social media ads. You can also run other ad campaigns that target your competitors. So when somebody searches a nearby gym or another personal trainer name, you can run ads at the top of Google and also be there just kinda creating awareness. Maybe they didn't know about you, they click it and they learn about you and go with you instead. You can also target on social media based on followers of brands. So you can run an ad campaign that targets people that also follow nearby gyms and personal trainers. This creates awareness. A lot of times people just like to change. They just like change. And so they're kinda interested in trying another gym just for the sake of trying it. So if they know that you exist, you can potentially earn business by doing this. And maybe you've had a client leave and go to another gym, but now they see you because you're targeting them on social media in this way. And it makes them think, you know what? They were pretty cool. I'm gonna go back there. So you win the business back. That's one power tip. The other power tip is to use an all-in-one marketing solution that pulls all of the things that I've just talked about into one platform to make it easy. Because marketing can be complicated and doing all these things, logging into Facebook for this and Google for that, and a CRM for this and an email for that can be very time-consuming and overwhelming. But if you could just log into one platform to do everything, that's where the ticket is and that's where you're gonna grow your business. And also a platform that offers talent to help you do these things because you only have so many hours in the day. So take a look for something like that. Marketing 360 is a great solution as well.

    "data": " There are two ways you can introduce a character. They can be static or they can be on the move. And it can be really fun if you want to meet somebody, if you want to encounter somebody, if you're bringing on a character, to just throw them into an unfamiliar setting, to make the reader do a lot of the work. But by the same token, you're making people immediately have to figure out what's going on. Here we go. This is a book called Trigger Warning, and it contains in it a short story that I wrote, a set of 12. Short stories are called Calendar of Tales. Here's the October tale. And I'll go through the whole thing because it's fairly short, and it does a whole bunch of stuff with character. And then I'll tell you what I did, and I'll tell you why I did it. That feels good, I said, and I stretched my neck to get out the last of the cramp. It didn't just feel good. It felt great, actually. I'd been squashed up inside that lamp for so long. I'd been in the bathroom for so long. I'd been in the bathroom for so long. You start to think that nobody's ever going to rub it again. You're a genie, said the young lady with the polishing cloth in her hand. I am. You're a smart girl, Toots. What gave me away? The appearing in a puff of smoke, she said, and you look like a genie. You've got the turban and the pointy shoes. I folded my arms and blinked. Now I was wearing blue jeans, grey sneakers, and a faded grey sweater. The male uniform of this time and this place. I raised a hand to my forehead and I bowed deeply. I am the genie of the lamp, I told her. Rejoice, oh fortunate one. I have it in my power to grant you three wishes. And don't try the I wish for more wishes thing. I won't play and you'll lose a wish. Right, go for it. I folded my arms again. No, she said. I mean, thanks and all that, but it's fine. I'm good. Honey, I said, Toots, sweetie. Perhaps you misheard me. I'm a genie. And the three wishes. We're talking anything you want. You ever dreamed of flying? I can give you wings. You want to be wealthy, richer than Croesus? You want power. Just say it. Three wishes. Whatever you want. Like I said, she said, Thanks, I'm fine. Would you like something to drink? You must be parched after spending so much time in that lamp. Wine? Water? Tea? Uh, actually, now she came to mention it, I was thirsty. Do you have any mint tea? She made me some mint tea in a teapot that was almost a twin to the lamp in which I'd spent the greater part of the last thousand years. Thank you for the tea. No problem. But I don't get it. Everyone I've ever met, they start asking for things. A fancy house, a harem of gorgeous women. Not that you'd want that, of course. I might, she said. You can't just make assumptions about people. You can't just make assumptions about people. Oh, and don't call me toots or sweetie or any of those things. My name's Hazel. Ah, I understood. You want a beautiful woman, then. My apologies. You have but to wish. I folded my arms. No, she said, I'm good. No wishes. How's the tea? I told her that the mint tea was the finest I had ever tasted. She asked me when I had started feeling a need to grant people's wishes, and whether I felt a desperate need to please. I said, I don't know. I don't know. I don't feel a desperate need to please. She asked about my mother, and I told her that she could not judge me as she would judge mortals, for I was a djinn, powerful and wise, magical and mysterious. She asked me if I liked hummus, and when I said that I did, she toasted a pita bread and sliced it up for me to dip into the hummus. I dipped my bread slices into the hummus and ate it with delight. The hummus gave me an idea. Just make a wish. I said, helpful. I said, helpfully. And I could have a meal fit for a sultan brought in to you. Each dish would be finer than the one before and all served upon golden plates, and you could keep the plates afterwards. It's good, she said with a smile. Would you like to go for a walk? We walked together through the town. It felt good to stretch my legs after so many years in the land. We wound up in a public park, sitting on a bench by a lake. It was warm but gusty. And the autumn leaves fell in flurries each time the wind blew. I told Hazel about my youth as a djinn, of how we used to eavesdrop on the angels, and how they would throw comets at us if they spied us listening. I told her of the bad days of the djinn wars, and how King Suleiman had imprisoned us inside hollow objects, bottles, lamps, clay pots, that kind of thing. She told me of her parents, who were both killed in the same plane crash. And who had left her the house. She told me of her job illustrating children's books, a job she had backed into accidentally at the point she realized she would never be a really competent medical illustrator. And of how happy she became whenever she was sent a new book to illustrate. She told me she taught life drawing to adults at the local community college one evening a week. I saw no obvious flaw in her life. No hole that she could fill by working hard. No hole that she could fill by wishing. Save one. Your life is good, I told her. But you have no one to share it with. Wish and I will bring you the perfect man. Or woman. A film star. A rich person. No need. I'm good, she said. We walked back to her house, past houses dressed for Halloween. This is not right, I told her. People always want things. Not me. I've got everything I need. Then what do I do? She thought for a moment. Then she pointed at her front yard. Can you rake the leaves? Is that your wish? Nope. Just something you could do while I'm getting our dinner ready. I raked the leaves into a heap by the hedge to stop the wind from blowing it apart. After dinner, I washed up the dishes. I spent the night in Hazel's spare bedroom. It wasn't that she didn't want help. She let me help. I ran errands for her, picked up art supplies and groceries. On days she had been painting for a long time, she let me rub her neck and shoulders. I have good, firm hands. Shortly before Thanksgiving, I moved out of the spare bedroom across the hall into the main bedroom and Hazel's bed. I watched her face this morning as she slept. I stared at the shapes her lips make when she sleeps. I looked at her face. I looked at her face. I looked at her face. I looked at her face. I looked at her face. I looked at her face. I looked at her face. I looked at her face. I looked at her face. I looked at her face. And she moonlighted back to me as it taught me how to raise my hand. From then I looked at Hazel, the little architect at this castle, and asked her why she had kept herself ahed so long in the dark. She said, Tell me about you, Hazel. Tell me about my遠きこれは So, we only have two people in that story. We have the genie, who never gets a name, and we have Hazel, who doesn't get a name until about halfway through the story. What's fun with this is we start literally with a bang. We start with the, this feels good, and him stretching his neck, and that's a very human moment. We don't know who our narrator is, but he's stretching his neck to get out the cramp. And then he says it didn't just feel good, it felt great. I've been squashed up inside that lamp for so long, you start to think that nobody's ever going to rub it again. And the next line, of course, which lands that idea for anybody who's going, hang on, this is, you're a genie, said the young lady with the polishing cloth in her hand. Now we have two characters. We don't know anything about them, other than one is a genie, and one is the young lady who has just set him free. His reply is, I am, you're a smart girl, Toots, what gave me away? And you're going, that Toots is kind of a bit of a weird little put-down. He's, and it's also a very odd thing for a genie to say. So he's patronizing, he's of another time and hasn't quite got up to date with the language. And he feels like a genie in my mind, although obviously he's probably been in that lamp for, let's say he's been, you know, imprisoned in there for many thousands of years. I suspect that probably the last time he came out and did wishes was probably, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. Probably the 1940s, 1930s or 40s. So he's a mass of 1930s and 40s attitudes. And that little Toots, which is just so completely not of its time and not of its place, kind of tells you that. Her reply is, the appearing in a puff of smoke, she said, and you look like a genie. You've got the turban and the pointy shoes. And we already know that she is practical and sensible. And she gives the absolutely practical, sensible reply. He transforms himself. He does a full speech. He gets very formal and does the, I am the genie of the lamp, rejoice, oh fortunate one. I have it in my power to grant you three wishes. And then undercuts it somewhat with his little speech about, don't do the I wish for more wishes thing, but it's right, go. And she says, no. I mean, thanks and all that, but it's fine. I'm good. And now we suddenly have a plot. We don't just have two characters because we have something that we've never seen before. We have a genie who is prepared to grant somebody three wishes and somebody saying, I'm good. It's okay. And that for me was the, that was the little bit of grit that I, I tried to build a small pearl around. What happens if a genie shows up and tries to grant three wishes to somebody who's just fine. They're okay. I don't, and I'm like, I don't ever remember seeing that ever as a scenario, as a genie scenario. That's, there are lots and lots of genie stories. Most of them you kind of feel have been done, but that one hasn't been done. So that might be really fun to do. And now they start to become people and you get to watch them bump into each other. You get to watch her put him in his place, puncture his preconceptions. Um, you know, when, when he says a harem of gorgeous women, not that you'd want that, of course. And she says, I might, you can't just make assumptions about people. Oh, and don't call me. Tut. I'm not a tux or sweetie or any of those things. My name is Hazel. And you feel like, right. She's just very gently and very kindly put him in his place. And he is going to have things to learn through the story. Long ago, I read an essay by Robert Heinlein, where he said that there were basically three stories. He said there was the little tailor. Somebody starts off, poor and gets rich and famous and important. There was boy meets girl with all of the things that can go wrong in that boy can lose girl boy can gain girl boy. All of the romance stories said, and there's a man learns a lesson. And the story in which somebody gets to learn better. Somebody gets to change their mind. Somebody gets to see the world differently. Um, it was a beautiful shape for a story. And it's the one that is. It's the one that hasn't done, I think enough. And is one that I always like to fall back on. The joy of this story is now, even if you don't know it. And even if it is, I guess very simplistically and very simply a boy meets girl story. It's absolutely a story about somebody learning a lesson. And from there, his attempts to try and get her to make it work. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I, yeah. Okay. And I, Now we have two people, and one of them is completely in her element. And the other is absolutely out of his element. Okay? He's not going to grant three wishes and return to the lab, or what's he going to do? And the idea of just putting him in the Monday missed possible situation, actually, at that point, you're making the mundane. feel exotic and magical by his presence. And you're making him feel a lot more interesting because he is a fish out of water. A wish-granting genie in an Arabian night's world is just one more piece of set decoration. A wish-granting genie with no wishes to grant wandering around a small American town shortly before Halloween. Halloween is an odd thing that doesn't quite resolve. It's like a little musical passage that you need to keep reading because you want to know how this is going to end. Where does this end? And of course, it ends with him moving in with her, with him eventually moving in as we know the one thing that she is missing is the fact that he is missing. He is missing somebody to love. And now he is becoming that person without actually granting her a wish. And you also realize that this person who we met at the beginning, who was kind of full of himself, full of attitude, very conscious of his status, but kind of insecure, has also changed when we get right to the end. When she says, you know, what I never asked, she says, is what about you? What would you wish? What would you wish for if I asked what your three wishes were? I thought for a moment, I put my arm around her and she snuggled her head into my shoulder. It's okay, I told her, I'm good. And that's the moment that you realize that the genie's changed too.",

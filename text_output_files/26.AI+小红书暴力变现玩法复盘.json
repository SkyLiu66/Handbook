    "data": " Hello, hello. Hello, everyone. Good evening. I'm Annie. Okay, so let's get started with today's class. Can you hear my voice? If you can hear me, press 1. If you can hear me, press 1 in the comments. Let the teacher hear your voice. Okay, so let's get started. If you haven't come yet, we won't wait. They can just listen to the recording. That's all right. Okay, let's get started. Today's class is mainly about going to see the homework of all the students here. And then there's another one. Because now I found that some of the students' homework haven't been able to submit yet. So I'm going to emphasize here again. All the homework must be completed. Actually, today is the seventh time. According to the normal progress, today should be at least the sixth time. But some students may not have it yet. There may be some students who are in the fourth and fifth time. Right? Then I'll take a look at the first three homework. Okay, let's take a look at the first three homework. Then especially the second time. Then take a look at the situation of students' account drawing. Then I also found that some students drew well. Some students have already wanted to receive the order. Then we will combine the homework submitted by the students today. And then, that is to say, combine this little book e-commerce section to make an expansion for the students. Okay? Okay, let's start. Let's take a look first. One by one. This is this student called Huang Cong. Take a look. This is Huang Cong. This is Huang Cong. This is Huang Cong. This is Huang Cong. This is Huang Cong. This is Huang Cong. This is Huang Cong. This is Huang Cong. This is Huang Cong. This is her. Our account is this. The first one is the mj account. I won't look at this one. We mainly look at the target. Then you can take a look at someone else's target account. This is the first target account. The group. Group. Shown. Then you can take a look. 310,000 fans. This account was created relatively early. You can take a look and search for yourself. Right? You can not only look at your own. Look at mine. You can also go to this target account of others. You can go and have a look yourself. This is 11. You will find that it is all with the picture. Then this is the one with the picture. This is the one with the picture. This is the one with the picture. 然后去看别人的这个简介。 我现在还看到有些同学简介还没有改啊,一定要去更改。 你可以看一下别人的约稿,照片,改漫画啊,可出教程。 然后求高薪原图的宝宝,然后去撕我,对吧? 然后收藏笔记,看我笔记,然后收藏笔记。 原创者,什么部分模特图,原因网络啊,如青连山。 你们可以大家看,这是别人画的,你们可以多去看几个。 后面我就不看了。 这个是同学们有东西参考我的,对吧? 拿我的账号做对标的,你们也可以看一下。 这边,陆雨溪,是不是? 这个账号,这个账号也还可以,我感觉还不错,你们可以去看一下。 都可以啊。 然后这边也是,这个账号跟你们说一下,这个账号它跟我们的玩法不一样。 这个账号呢是做虚拟IP的,不知道你们能不能看见,叫人工智言。 它是做虚拟IP的,这种玩法的话,我们也, 之前也想去尝试,但是呢,因为我时间不足,然后就没有去做这个板块。 这个板块的玩法呢,它其实就是做虚拟IP,什么叫虚拟IP呢? 比方说我去以某一个这个虚拟人物为,你也知道这个是吧? 它以某一个这个虚拟人物为原型,然后呢,去做它的日常, 比方说今天去打篮球啊,今天去咖啡厅啦,今天去这个,约闺蜜去喝下午茶了呀。 它会,相当于是一个, 比方说真人博主,但是呢,它是虚拟的IP,明白吗? 这种也是可以做的,然后这种做的呢,它主要是接一些商业广告啊, 它的变现方式主要是接一些商业广告,也是可以去参考的,我往这边拉一拉,好吧,你们都去看一下。 然后这个是小红薯绘画画,这个账号,这账号一般吧,我感觉一般啊,你们可以自己看一下。 这个的变现路径我感觉不是特别好,你们可以自己去看一下。 然后有一些好的我会拿出来给你们说啊。 这个AI绘画mini,你们可以大致看一下这个账号,2.2万的,你们可以看到它的账号,它的风格其实跟我的风格就不一样了,对吧? 它的风格可能就是偏向于日漫风,这种也是可以做啊,也是可以的,不一定也是完全按照我的那个风格来。 这个是AI图大大,你们可以大致看一下,2.2万的,对吧? 这个账号,它可能做的都是一些这个动物的,然后就是相对来说烧生肖,烧生肖板块的。 也是可以啊,也是可以做的。 所以能做的范畴其实是比较大的,不一定就是完全是按照我的来。 你们可以看一下这个,Lisa的下班时间,对吧? 这个其实我觉得一般啊,我感觉是一般,虽然2.4万的粉丝,但我感觉一般,它主要是靠这个图片吸引人的。 但它的变现我感觉可能不是特别好。 这个你们大致看,这个是作品为AI创作,然后图像剧本立绘,海报,场景。 这个变现的这个路径就相对来说比较宽泛了啊。 我们可以看,这个账号可以参考。 它是做剧本杀美工接稿的。 它也不是单纯画头像,它画的会比较多啊。 当然这个旧卖头像,你看,这种也是我看到就单纯,就是专门做这种旧卖头像的也有啊。 然后他们的整个账号的数据也是不错的。 所以风格啊,有很多种啊,有很多种。 再强调一次。 这边啊,沃克星。 你们可以大致看一下。 这我就不,我就不。 不带你们多看了,反正账号还蛮多的。 然后建议大家就是每天多花点时间去看账号。 这个是AI必加索。 这,这也挺好的。 它主要是做这个宠物的。 这我感觉也蛮不错的。 然后约稿授权合作啊。 看到它的变形方式吗? 也还不错啊。 可以去看,可以去参考。 嗯,这个我觉得一般吧。 这个感觉一般。 它虽然是做头像,但我感觉是一般的啊。 所以找这个对标。 它也决定了很多东西。 这个也是这位同学找的啊。 AI必加索。 对吧。 啊,这怎么又是我。 嗯,Midjuni社区。 这个,这个还好。 这个它其实主要还是可能会偏向于教程啊。 教学类的。 这种需要一定的技术。 如果说各位同学把Midjuni啊。 整体的这样的一整套的学习。 我,我到现在我都不敢自己。 就是Midjuni学得非常一流,非常有技术。 到现在。 没有啊。 因为我也只是就是学了一个月不到啊。 然后就上手了。 所以的话如果真的有那种吧。 Midjuni学得非常,非常溜的。 像我们有一位老师啊。 他是非常溜的。 然后他是可以去出这种,这种,这种,这种,这种账号的。 啊,这种账号是他们这种技术流可以去做的。 像我的话我,我其实不是技术流啊。 我主要还是就是偏向于自媒体运营这个板块的。 嗯,我稍微会一点点这个Midjuni就可以了。 这种是。 啊,这种也不错。 这个是做这个可能就是啊,比方说也是女生头像。 然后还有母婴的啊,就是妈妈和。 其实,其实这个啊,就是昨天啊,就是母亲节。 母亲节其实有好多人来找我约稿约画。 就是母亲的,就是母亲和孩子的啊,这种嗯,怎么说呢? 海报和头像也有很多人来找我,但是我没接啊,我没接。 一方面是我们这边就是单子接不过来。 然后另外一方面的话,其实也涉及到就是偏向我的轨道。 因为我主要是做就是美女头像的嘛,美少女头像的。 所以这种母婴的其实我就没做,但是并不代表不能做啊。 那比方说你去做这种专门做亲子照的,对吧? 然后专门做宝宝照片的啊,都是可以的,都是非常好的。 嗯,然后只要是你自己的定位是这样的,都可以去做啊。 包括我看到我们有一位同学,他就是专门做孩子的。 啊,也是非常好的。 啊,也是非常好的。 我忘了是哪位同学,但是我看了作业,我是记得有这个印象的。 好吧? 然后关于母亲节呢,其实比方说有的东西是我想蹭个热点。 你像昨天的热点,我就没有看到我们有同学去蹭啊。 昨天的母亲节我也没有去蹭,但我没有蹭的原因是因为并不是因为我不去蹭,而是因为它并不跟我的定位和方向是一致的。 所以我昨天没有去硬蹭这个热点。 但是昨天像母亲节,其实很多AI会画的这个创作者,他们都是画了这种跟母亲节相同的。 相关的啊,这样的一些头像和壁纸,其实你们也是可以做的,对吧? 这我就不多说了啊,这第一次作业,然后呢,我就大致看一下。 然后我会发现很多同学啊,他作业就是越提交越少啊,这个是不行的啊,一定要坚持去做。 然后这是第二次作业啊,主要是讲一下第二次作业。 第二作业,比方说这位同学啊,你可以看一下。 这种,这种呢,其实说实话啊,嗯,我想说可能有些,有些可能会喜欢,但我还想说一下像这种呢。 男性的商务的头像,你说老师有没有接到这种单呢? 有,但很少,可能二十个里面有一个,真的,可能二十里面,二十个里面可能会有,就是二十单里面可能会有一单,会是这种的。 但我想跟大家说就是,嗯,画男性的,画男性的这种,还相对来说比较少的,还有这种偏商务的,不是说没有啊,他的单量可能会相对来说少一点,也是可以去做。 但是我觉得不能把它作为一个纯净的。 啊,就是你的一个专攻的方向,他是不行的,明白吗? 这个你可以看一下,然后像做这种男生的啊,其实我说一下,做男生的,其实我最近在摸的时候,我会发现,就是你的Junior他画男生,他其实很难做到十足的相似啊,很难。 然后我最近呢,其实在想,是不是可以做那种怪诞风啊,就是我自己有去尝试,给你看一下。 在哪边?啊,在这边。 其实我自己有去尝试。 可以给你们大致看一下,但是我也不知道。 对,比方说像这种,你们能看出来是谁吗? 这能看出来是谁吗? 嗯,大概就是,就是类似于这种的照片啊,你们可以大致看一下。 这个是,这两天我去尝试了另外一种风格,但是我没有去发啊,也没有去做,但是我觉得这种风格也是可以去尝试的吧,也是可以去尝试的,而且我觉得这种可能相对来说,会也吃一部分,就是男性的。 这个也是啊,我们可以大致看一下。 这种呢,女生呢,就不多说了。 然后像这个,这个能看出来是谁吗? 这个大家能看出来是谁吗? 画了不多啊,因为我就简单尝试了一下,然后这种风格呢,它属于相对来说比较怪诞一点的。 然后呢,比较适合,比较适合画男相啊,比较适合画男相,然后也是有部分的群体会比较喜欢的,但是我还没有去经过市场的验证啊,我只是单纯的就用画了画。 然后我觉得回头可以试一下。 但是我现在还没有试,但这个试我可能会另开号去试啊,可能会另开号去试,不会在我这个账号上面去试的,比较偏离了我的这个风格。 好,然后继续。 嗯,这是这位同学啊,说到男相的时候我就说一下。 然后这位同学啊,这位同学叫夏,叫夏,看一下。 这个呢,其实我说实话啊,这个风格我个人是不喜欢的。 我个人是不喜欢的。 他会,就是我们正常绘画的话,你要,你要。 你要知道一个点儿,就是你要知道女,女生她们喜欢的风格是什么类型的。 像这种女生相对来说可能不会过多去选择。 还有一个的话就是你会发现这个头发太卷了啊,如果是我的话,这张图像我是不会去发小红书的啊,不会去发小红书的。 你可以自己去衡量一下,然后这种风格说实话,它也不是很好,然后像素也不是很清晰,也没有什么细节,就整体画面没有细节感啊,是我个人不是很喜欢的。 啊,这位同学。 这位同学又是个男生啊,但是我没看到原图,我不知道对比是什么样的,但是感觉还行啊。 如果他能做,都做这种的话,其实我感觉还行,还可以去试啊。 然后这位同学,印象比较深啊,阳光,他做的好像就是,嗯,就是孩子的啊,不知道是不是自己的孩子啊。 然后我觉得画的都还挺不错的,感觉还不错。 然后如果说,如果是,如果是,如果是我的话,我会坚持说做这种小孩子的啊。 当然你也不能就是全部是一个,就是全部是一组吧,因为我看风格比较太相近了。 还有一个就是阳光不知道在不在啊。 还有一个我看了他的账号,账号的封面做的过于花里胡哨了啊,过于花了,所以可以稍微调整一下,稍微调整一下。 然后这个待会再说吧,待会看你们账号的时候再一起去说啊。 啊,再是吧,你的,你其实我觉得你绘的图挺好的,就是这个图画的都挺好的。 但是你的笔记是有问题的,你的笔记,包括你的封面是有问题的。 待会我们一起去讲好不好。 继续啊。 这位同学我印象也比较深啊,因为我看了他绘画的很多污辜,我能看见什么呢? 我能看见他的进步啊。 然后呢,这张图,怎么说,就单纯从第二次作业来说,这个其实是我个人不是很喜欢的,就这种风格我也不是很喜欢。 然后绘画出来的这种感觉也不是很好。 还有一个话,就是这个图画的这种感觉也不是很好。 啊,就是想说一下,呃,Midjuni呢,包括这个AI绘画呢,它对于人的手指,它其实是很难画的,就画不好。 所以的话我想跟大家说,就如果你们后续去接单也好,或者你后续去寻找这个图片去绘图也好,尽量不要选择手挡脸的。 因为很多女生拍照喜欢,啊,比这个剪刀手或者手托腮,就各种把手挡在脸部的这种照片,尽量暂时不要去画。 但是不是说不能啊。 因为后面的话,Midjuni它其实还是会不断的去升级。 包括它其实它的随机性太强了,并不是说它画不好,或者说怎么样,或者说它不能画。 我没有说它不能画,它是可以画的,但是它有一定的随机性,而且这个随机性让人很头疼啊,很头疼。 好吧,好,继续啊。 这位同学这个画的照片,说实话啊,跟这个本人也没什么相关性啊,看到没有? 照片跟本人的相关性其实也不是很重要。 相关性其实也不是很大。 但这种风格,就是我想说,就是你们在绘画的时候,偏向于卡通化,和这个偏向于更加像,就是更加与本人的相似度更高的。 它这两个其实一定是有取舍的。 像这种更加,更加卡通化的,它很难做到跟真人的脸很相似。 除非说你使用换脸工具啊,除非说你使用换脸。 如果用换脸的话,它其实效果也不是很好啊,也不是很好。 五官比例会失衡。 因为卡通的人物的脸和真人的脸的比例,它还是不一样的。 它并不能说把你鼻子抠下来放到卡通的人物上面,把你的嘴抠下来放到卡通的人物上面,它不是这样就做的。 但是如果你通过换脸的话,你就会发现比例失衡,所以它很难做到相似啊,很难做到相似。 好,继续。 然后下一位同学,这个又是一个笔页的啊,又是一个笔页的。 但你会发现啊,页直接没有了。 这个手指直接上去了啊,不相关。 给我的感觉就是不是很相关。 这种风格可能会是有一些人群会喜欢的啊,就这种灵动的风格。 也是可以去尝试啊。 这位同学是周静雨啊,也还可以。 我感觉画得还可以。 但是呢,你要说相似度有没有呢,其实还好。 其实还好。 就据我了解,据我接触这么多客户下来,我感觉大众应该不是很喜欢。 然后这位同学印象比较深。 基本上是很喜欢。 但是画得是没什么相关性的。 你们觉得像吗? 你们觉得像这个,叫什么名字来着? 彭兴燕吗? 你们觉得像吗? 我感觉国籍都发生了变化。 我感觉不是很像啊。 感觉不是很像。 好,下一个。 这个,哦,这个我还没看啊。 这个我是看漏了嘛。 这个也还不错啊。 这有点偏向于手绘风。 这个可以去坚持去做啊。 可以的。 这个是哪位同学? 自由人啊,也还可以。 好,下一张。 这个,我看看画出来什么样呢? 嗯? 也是,你们会发现画男像它会不那么相似啊。 但是可能有一点点的感觉在。 但是还是不是很相似。 是吧? 嗯,这个你们可以自己再去调一下。 反正我现在画男像的话,可能也会出现相似的吧。 但是呢,就是很难达到就是男性比较喜欢的那个点。 的确。 好,这张。 这张还蛮像的啊。 这张还蛮像的啊。 这张我感觉还挺不错的。 这是谁啊? 孙先生画的啊。 挺不错的。 挺有感觉的。 这是可以的啊。 这个我感觉是可以的。 画男像画女像都可以啊。 这个。 好,那这是这个第二次作业。 然后接下来看下第三次作业。 然后很多同学提交的,还有一部分我是没看到的。 所以如果需要老师帮你们去看作业的,你们一定要就是提前啊。 然后这个是我看到的部分同学就是提交的作业。 还有些同学我都没看到。 还有些同学我都没看见啊。 你们可以看一下。 稍等,这位同学叫夏。 爱笑的。 这个头像,说实话,你们要注意一个问题。 小红书它是怎么说呢? 小红书的用户群体是颜值控,能明白吗? 能明白吗? 它会对于各种的颜值,就是颜值大于一切,明白吗? 包括你们做的这个封面图,各种的颜值控,能明白吗? 它会对于各种的颜值,就是颜值大于一切,明白吗? 包括你们做的这个封面图,各种的颜值控,能明白吗? 包括你们做的这个封面图,各种的颜值控,能明白吗? 包括你们做的这个封面图,各种的颜值控,能明白吗? 包括你们做的这个封面图,各种的颜值控,能明白吗? 包括你们做的这个封面图,各种的颜值控,能明白吗? 小红书这个印明的それ都PI的。 小红书这个再超过20%的意境了,大 Voilà。 好, drill Now.  extreme product standpoint, kr 就是这个海雨具 amounts 很好来来 around here 嗯 感觉在軩後来 这个 因为这个它有很多是这样一<|gl|>然后吃呀 I've done this before, but it's not very bright. There's no traffic. I've tried all kinds of things before, but in fact, it's not very bright. You can try it out. And this one. Did you draw this yourself? This is not bad. This is not bad, but I want to emphasize that this one must not have traffic in Xiaohongshu. It must not have traffic. It's very nice and spicy, but it must not have traffic in Xiaohongshu. If you do this, you can post it on Douyin. Post it on Douyin and Facebook. Okay? Okay. And this one. Look at this. Mother's Day. Did you draw this yesterday? Mother's Day. Not bad, right? But you may find that this one, how can I say it? It can be posted more often. And I want to tell you guys, when you send notes, try not to send only one picture. Send more pictures, more than three pictures. Three to five pictures. Don't send only one picture. If you send only one picture, it doesn't work very well. And then there's this one. This position. See? It's the topic. There are too few topics. There are too few topics. Make it bigger. And then go to some book inspiration. I should have told you before. Obviously, this student hasn't participated in any book inspiration. Go to some book inspiration. For example, go to... Like I'm participating now. If you go to the hot search list, you can go to the hot search list. If you go to the hot search list, you will find that the hot search list is the most popular hot search recently. It's AI drawing. You can go and find it. How long have I been talking about it? I've been talking for about 20 minutes. Okay, this is this student. It's mainly to see your homework. Okay, then continue. This student, who is this? Look, it's a single picture again. Try to have more pictures. Who is this goddess? This is what you do for this kind of star education, right? This is okay, too. But this kind of painting doesn't have much quantity. To be honest, to be honest, it doesn't have much quantity. Like this student sent these few notes. In my opinion, they are basically all of them. There is no quantity. Then this one. Take a look. Is this a video? This is a video of this student. He changed the picture into a video. But I want to say that he drew this pretty well. Overall, it's okay. Then there is another one I want to tell you. You have to go to the Little Red Book platform. What kind of picture does he like recently? I saw someone draw that kind of high-resolution notebook. What kind of boy is that? It's a water-resistant boy. I don't know if you guys have it. It's water-resistant. Water-resistant. If you go and see it, you can go and see it. This is the kind of image that someone else has drawn. You can draw it again. Water-resistant boy. Water-resistant girl. You can draw this. Like this student. This painting, I actually feel okay. It's okay. It's okay. But I suggest that before you create a copy, Learn first. Then you can imitate the copy. This is a It's pretty good. It's not bad. But to be honest, like this, he won't have too much quantity. Because this, to be honest, this is too simple. You guys say it's not. You want to draw this kind of picture. It's too simple. Now ten people. You have to go to the right. It's equivalent to corresponding to your number. Then go to draw a picture. But I want to say this classmate. Overall, I still think it's not bad. Because he's been sending notes. Keep sending. And the amount of notes is also quite large. Not bad. And this is a single picture. Suggest more. Suggest more. All right. What is this? Draw an image for the king. Right. This is also pretty good. It's also a dot. It's also an idea. But to be honest. This is a bit different. This is five days. I don't feel like I'm drawing it. This is a little cute. A little cute. This is actually a thought. It's also a dot. It's a picture of a game character. But to be honest. Game characters are anime images themselves. It's a cartoon image itself. So you want to draw it again. It's actually quite difficult. This is also. I found this classmate. I still like to draw this foreigner. He's not relatively honest. It's not too much. I've seen this kind of thing. This kind of thing. There was a hot pot on the small book platform a while ago. It's also possible to do. Like this. Why would you say that this kind of possibility will be better? You have to consider the problem. What kind of a hot word does the platform have? It's easy. It's just that it's exposed. For example, if you really want to do this kind of image, Then you have to consider what kind of pictures this brand has. It's more popular. You can do it. You can refer to it. Why do you think this is okay? Because this kind of thing. I used to be. I've seen this kind of big pet and little girl. This is a bit of a beast. This kind of image of a girl. This is something you can do. Do you understand? This can be included. His hand is very beautiful. And tell them that the hand is very important. You see, this hand is very beautiful. His data is not bad. I'll say it again. Little red book platform is a beauty. A platform with beauty as the world. Your hand must be beautiful. Because I think this one is beautiful. This one is beautiful. This one is actually also thirsty. You can also. But this kind of words. I don't think there's much light. Including which ones I'm still looking at. Is thirsty. This cover is also thirsty. This cover. I'm just talking about the cover. This cover is thirsty. But you can add some more words to this cover. And then this cover is thirsty. And then it's gone. It's gone. Basically, in my opinion, these two covers are thirsty. If you adjust this cover, it's also thirsty. It's okay. This is the homework of this classmate. Not bad. At least he's doing it. And the quality of his paintings is okay. It's not bad. But I don't think the direction is right. Because you see. One will draw this kind of. One will be a beauty. One will be like this. One will be like this. It's a little messy. You have to find your own direction to do it. Okay. Don't be a real person and a comparison of AI. One will be the comparison of the game character. One will be this again. You have to find one of your own. A good point to do. Can't just change it. Understand? Which classmate is this? AI. AI drawing. Secret. How long has a fan been doing it? Let me take a look at this. Take a look at it. Very flustered. You see. Not even a topic. This classmate. No topic. No title. How is this possible? You see this. You see this title. No title. No title. There is a title. Godzilla Walks in the Los Angeles. The Dragon and the Princess. This title doesn't work. Classmates. The title doesn't work. This classmate. His title doesn't work. You have to know. I had a class before. When I told you about the title. I've talked about it. What is the title? He must be. The search for your keyword. I told you. The source of the traffic of the little red book is two. One is the search traffic. One is the promotion traffic. Understand? Then search traffic. It's like. You can take the title of the little red book. What is it? As SEO keywords. Understand? If you want your notes. Someone to watch. Someone to search. There are users. There are systems to recommend. You must write it more. Normal little red book notes. His title is 20 words. You normally write 18 or 19 words. You don't write 20. Because if you write 20. He will hide your title. Hide the last few words. So you can write 18 or 19 words. 18 or 19 words. You can watch the previous live broadcast. You can watch it. Go see it yourself. Okay. And this. This is nothing. I don't feel anything. This classmate drew a little biased. It's a little biased in my opinion. Are you doing a pen or a simple homework? I don't feel good about this. Kersla is getting ready. A little bit. This classmate is a little bit. A little bit biased. You. The reality is biased. This bad dragon. Well, not very good. This classmate. To be honest. You don't draw well. And the quantity is not enough. The first one I drew on May 12th. You see. Just a classmate. In fact, the classmate entered the camp. Basically the same time. You see. On the 12th. Then it started today. Three days in the middle. Short-term. Little red book platform is very, very opportunity short-term. Very opportunity short-term. Understand? Can the classmate understand? Very opportunity short-term. Where is the link? You can go find. You can go find. You can ask the classmate in the group. Ask the classmate. Well, this classmate. This note content. Four. Not one passes here. Not one passes here. OK? If you want to do it well. Think about it. What kind of account do you have? You this. Your direction. You have no reference to the target. Note will not write. The title will not write. You can go to the previous tutorial. You can also go to your target account. But this classmate. I suggest you change your avatar. Just say it. Change your avatar. OK? And then. Let's determine the overall style. For example, you are doing this style. You want this. These two covers are very good. Right? And then the other cover. To be honest. Not very good. Not very good. OK. OK. Next classmate. Full dad. This is the classmate I just mentioned. It's called sunshine. Right? You see. Well, I have a good impression of my classmates. This classmate. I actually think your direction is fine. Your painting is also fine. Then I'll talk about a few points first. First point. Don't use single pictures. Second point. All your cover. You try to be the same size. The third point. The cover is too flashy. Too flashy. Too flashy. Can't stand out. You say the word flower. No need to be too flashy. No need. Although we have the word flower. But not too flashy. Then tell everyone. For example, you are normal. You need to know your hand painting. First, the first point is good looking. What is the second point? For example, this picture. I can't find the point. I can't find the point. I don't know. And this circle is also very small. It looks a little bit to me. These flowers are all useless flowers. These flowers are not important. It doesn't matter whether you look at it or not. Right? Then. The size of the cover is the same. Like this cover. I think you can adjust it again. But it's not good. Then tell everyone. For example, this classmate. If you want to draw a child. You insist on drawing only children. Only draw children. Only draw children. Only draw children. Then. Because I see you this is the production of baby images. Right? You can not necessarily be around yourself. You can occasionally find some online pictures. Then how to find this online picture. I'll tell him later. And then. And then. Try to find some relatively cute babies. But this baby is also very cute. You can find some more cute online pictures. Then go to draw some relatively cute ones. More cartoon. It's a little bit of what you drew. Relatively speaking. You are relatively a little bit. Too real. Because children don't need to be so real. Understand? You imagine this. This should be drawn, right? Is not it? But to be honest. In fact, it can be cuter. Can be more. More cute. More human. You this. You. You. Children's paintings don't need to be so real. He can be more cartoon. I used to. Actually, I have seen an account before. Drawing children. But I'm thinking now. I can't remember which account it is now. I can share it with you later. Can I share it with you later? The account of the child he drew is not bad. You can refer to it. You can go to find some special. It's for baby images. Can this student hear it? Still in class? If you are, you can go to class one. You can go to find some special. Some accounts like this for drawing baby images. Go directly to this pixel level. Go to imitate. Direct pixel level imitation. Understand? Don't do it yourself. You are too messy overall. It's too messy to open your main page. You go directly to find one. Drawing a baby. An account of the same image. Direct pixel level imitation. Direct copy. What model is he using? What model do you use? Understand? The same. It's just that the picture inside is different. You should. He sent a few pictures in one video. He sent a few pictures in one video. You send a few pictures. You are like this. You are all in one. It's a bit of a waste for me. Look at you. You can send a few pictures. You sent two pictures. You are a bit of a waste. Know that? You can do more. Go directly to imitate. All right. I won't say more here. All right. Then this is. Sunshine666. Then the next student. Look at. Ah. And. And. I just looked. It seems to be your. Do you have any of your title? Don't write MJ. Directly. Midjunior. Directly midjunior. Then like this AI production. You can change it to AI painting. Because. Because AI painting is. Hot search word. Don't think about writing it yourself. Always think about writing it yourself. Actually, it's wrong. No way. Think about it yourself. For example, MJ. Production. Maw. Head. Head. You feel like there's nothing to. It seems to be almost right. Right. But you have to think about why others write it. It has. It has a quantity. Because you say this MJ. MJ. You go search. It doesn't have much quantity. But you go to midjunior. He has. He has a quantity. You go search. You go search for AI production. Maw head. There's no quantity. But you go search for AI painting. He has a quantity. So when you write a title. When writing keywords. You must consider. That's his search for traffic. His. His word. Where is his quantity. Right. And then. If you really can't find it. What to do. Direct. Go copy. Go imitate. Ah. Do you understand. The simplest way is to copy. Maw. Okay. And then this classmate. Ah. This head. Ah. This. This is fine. I won't say much. Fans zero. And then. What is this doing? Let me see. Make a head for your girlfriend. The first two. Used. The last one made by Niji. MJ. The same picture. I feel Niji is better.

Because. Because it's. Some people said the other day. Let me draw this. Take a look. Then I drew it. I can't find it now. I can't find it. Anyway, I drew it. I drew it, too. It's completely different when it's drawn. Hey, where did it go? Completely different. Just look at it. This is obviously different from the previous style. But I don't think so. It's just not working. Do you understand? What does this have to do with me? What's the connection? No connection. No, this classmate. Um. Oh, it's not easy to find the material, is it? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you draw a worm for me. I'm just. It's just someone who asked me to help him draw it. Take a look. I drew it. But in fact. You can't do this. Because. Oh, I'm thinking about it. Can I open mine? I think about it. Where is it? Actually, I don't know where I put it. I forgot. Because I just drew it two days ago. I can't remember where it is. Let me see if I can open it for you. Just to make a comparison for you, okay? Simple. And I don't necessarily open your Jony. Now it's a little bit. There's a little too much to open now. Wait a minute. I don't know if I can open it. I opened it. There's really too much information. It doesn't seem to be open. If you can't open it, forget it. Anyway, I can show you in private.

Take the picture and find it. Search. Only free. Only free. Okay. Then fans. I feel okay. Take a look at Fengqiao. I can't open too many things now. This is not good. This one shouldn't be particularly liked. This texture is not good. This one is fine. You see. If it were me, I might make this one a hand drawing. So hand drawing is very important. Put it on again. Hand drawing is very, very important. Understand? This one. It's stuck. I'm going to turn it off. Okay. You can take a look at this one. This is the material she drew just now. Which student did she draw just now? This one. This one. This one. Look. The style of key words is completely different. This is what I drew. This is what I drew. Okay. This is what the other student drew. Can you see it? I'm not saying that you have all kinds of bad things. But I want to say that the style that people like, the style that girls like, is more like me. Like this. Understand? Like this. The two above are not good. I mainly chose the bottom. I didn't adjust it. I didn't adjust it. I just drew it briefly. And I didn't adjust it. If I adjusted it, it might be more like me. But I didn't adjust it. Let me tell you. Okay. And this is the end of this. This is the student just now. And this. This. This. This. She won't be particularly liked on the platform. I want to say. Then the love and surrender. This is also. It's pretty good. This is drawing a love and surrender. This is drawing a love and surrender. It can also be. Love and surrender is also a direction. It can also be done. But you can draw a few more. This is too little. Continue this. How to say? Generally. And this afternoon. It was posted at two o'clock in the afternoon. Isn't it a little too early? This time. This time is not good. It's usually after six o'clock. It's four or five o'clock. Five or six o'clock. This time will be a little better. And then the painting. To be honest. It's more ordinary. I want to say. Just this kind of painting. It's still the same as the classmate just now. There's a problem. As long as you can. You can basically draw it. Can you understand? Okay. The last classmate. It's the last classmate. Isn't it? That one was free. Isn't it? This is not good. This style is wrong. And then the overall. This is the last classmate. This is the last classmate. This is the last classmate. I can't do this. This style is wrong. And then the overall direction is not found. Okay. Next. I'll turn this off. Otherwise, it's too laggy. Okay. Otherwise, I'll turn on anything. It's very laggy. Oh, this one. Mandy. Mandy's shop. Draw this head. What is this head? This head is. What is this head? What is this head? What is this head? What is this head? What is this head? What is this head? What is this head? What is this head? I'll draw it. Would you like to change the head? What? What? What? What? This is a little like me. Ok. This is not bad. Which student is this? It seems to be good. Which classmate is this? I'll take a look. Mr. Sun. Not bad. Not bad. Let me take a look. Well, I just praised it, right? You can make a comparison map of this. You know? Try, try to make a comparison map. The cover of the Little Mouse platform. I have to do it. What's the title of this? This is a little bit. Generally, it's either high-quality, unless the picture is very high-quality, you can put it in the hand-painted version. If it's not very high-quality, you can do a comparison. Do you understand? Time is fine. Use MidJunior to make various pictures. Like YYDS. The title is not good, so I have to change it. But to be honest, it's not bad. I'll give you a like. I can't click it now. I'll give you a like later. It's okay. I think it's good. But the cover needs to be changed. I'll think about it again. The cover is very important. Don't put the cover too light. The cover is very important. The cover is greater than anything. I can tell you this way. The cover is greater than anything. It decides a lot about you. It decides your eyes. It decides whether you are a single. This is average. This picture is average. To be honest, it's average. And I don't know why. Maybe it's because of my telephoto. Anyway, the whole texture is not very good. This is not good either. The title is not good. The title is not good. Okay. The time is too late. 11.11. It's a little bit late. Different styles. Image, wallpaper, production. You can write a little more about this. And then you can write here. Whether you accept the draft. Whether you make a wish. Whether you can accept the wish. All kinds of things. You can write a little more about your business. Do you understand? Don't learn from me. I'm too lazy. This is for Mother's Day, isn't it? This is a little bit. It's a little bit bad. Your direction is right. When you think about it. It's right to say Mother's Day. But this one. It's not very good. You can take a look at it yourself. Not very good. Not very good. This is not very good either. And this is too little. Too little. This is not good either. The title is not good either. And then the words are relatively not good. And then this position. The key is that the topic is a little bit less. You can add a little more. All right. Look at this. Short hair. It's okay. To be honest. But if there's a comparison, it might be better. It's okay. It's okay. This is too much experience. And then you can change this. If you change it, your data will be better. Understand? Too cool. Too cool. Look at the one I hugged before. The title is too cool. Is it a hot word? This is too cool. But you're too little. Understand? Think about it. You're here. You have a few keywords in total. At most, you can step on a head. I can't step on anything else. Is it? Is it? You can't do this either. Want the original picture? Want the original picture. How do you give the original picture? How do you give it to your classmates? I usually give pictures in small programs. Small program to draw. Small program to draw. Understand? Just build a fan group. And then make an announcement in the fan group. In the fan group. For example, you pull a group. Build a group. If you want to. Because this is not a customer account. I usually don't give customer accounts. And then if it's not a customer account, You can build a fan group. And then after building a fan group, Then the group announcement. You can go to my group announcement. Aren't you in my group? Some classmates go to see the group announcement. And then? Direct small program to draw. Small program to draw. You can get some advertising fees. You can get advertising fees. Understand? This. It's okay. I think it's okay. I think it's pretty good. It's pretty similar. There's a similarity. But the beauty is not enough. The beauty is not enough. It's okay. You can continue. You can keep this style. It's kind of like my style. You can do it. This is the general. This is more general. This is what I want to say. Everyone can do it. I usually do this. I may just do it. I don't have anything to post today. I'll do it. Hum. Because it's easy to do. It's very simple. Understand? OK. I'll see the homework here. I'll see the homework here. Basically, I've seen the homework of the students who submitted it. Right? I didn't see it without submitting it.

I even feel that his introduction is still needed. I haven't found it yet. I haven't adjusted it yet. The target may be found. It's the same as not finding. There's no difference. Understand? All right. Next, I'll talk to you about it. It's a project of a small red book e-commerce. And then why do you want to tell you about it? The e-commerce project.

Solve the problem on your own. Then you have nothing. Is unsuccessful. There really is nothing. Is unsuccessful. Understand? The advantages of the little red book e-commerce project. You can take a look. The cost is very low. The operation is also relatively simple. Then it's a bit like. How to say. A little bit like the early Taobao. Taobao. Then many people say. I remember before. There are many people who said. It turns out that people who did Taobao in the early days. Now it's turned over. Right? Then the people who did what in the early days. He turned it over. But have you ever thought about it? This seal. This thing. He is. There will be one after another. It used to be Taobao. Right? Weishang. Later it was Weishang. Then later it might be. Douyin. Douyin. Douyin e-commerce. Right? Then Douyin live broadcast. Then have you ever thought about it? Little red book e-commerce. It's a seal this year. Then here it is.

I'm doing it for you. I really hope you can do it. I hope you can make money. Understand? Then a normal student. If they have their own project. Made it. He is not willing to share it with him. Understand? Including my previous account. Can I tell you the truth? When I was not a lecturer. I made my own account. How did I do it? I won't tell anyone. I won't be willing to tell anyone.

He actually has little red book e-commerce. Little red book e-commerce. How do you say it? He's always had this plan. There's always a scale. But if you really say. Which year is the seal? Which year is the year of the original? I can tell you. Two years. Two years. Three years. It's this year. It's this year. Understand? It's like a new start. A new start. Understand? You have to know that all of the self-media platforms. All have a feature. That is, the new start. Its tolerance is the strongest. You will find that now. It's easy to open a little red book e-commerce. Is it easy to open? Your personal e-commerce. One thousand yuan. Coupon. Then open immediately. Have you found it? Is it? Is it like this when you go to Douyin? Is it open immediately when you go to Douyin? No. Then at this time you will find. He actually. You happen to be in this. The seal stage of the company. You can do it. Over him. Right? Then I give you. Why did I go up? I went to do this avatar number. It's because of this avatar number. It's my personal feeling. It's more relaxed. Understand? It's more. And then it's more close. Our current class. It's AI. The actual battle. So I thought at that time. Take this as an entrance. Go and do it first. Go and test it first. A flow of small red book e-commerce. A few years. It's a few years. Because the small red book platform itself. It's a grass-raising platform. Just say. You have to consider the various support forces of the platform. Understand? The support of the small red book this year. It is very, very high. And you will find. The degree of friendship between new people. It's very, very high. Do you understand? You say. You a lot of people. You will find. Do you want to do a live broadcast? I'll tell you. You say. We often say. 2020. 2021 is the year of the live broadcast. Is the real live broadcast. Is it only that year? No. There was before. Just say. Now the platform gives a lot of support. And a lot of traffic. Started to flow towards this platform. You want the little red book. The little red book. Before. It's not up to 2.6 billion. Now it's up to 2.6 billion. What concept? The live broadcast of Douyin. Only reached 300 million. Now the little red book. Directly to 2.6 billion. And the user's awareness of the little red book. Much greater than other platforms. Do you understand what I mean? Can you understand? If you have a little red book. Or you have your own. Search the little red book platform. Go to see some of the little red books. Some platform data report analysis. You will find. The user's payment capacity of the little red book platform. Much greater than other platforms. And the payment. Awareness. Much greater than other platforms. Can you understand? The little red book platform. It's directly a lot of users. A platform for buying products. For example, for the female community. For example, if I choose. For example, I want to buy something. For example, I want to buy a drink. Then I might go to the little red book platform first. Search for it. Take a look at the public's evaluation of it. And then to its plant. And then at this time. I might go to the order. So the little red book platform. It has already. It has been in the previous few years. Such a positioning process. To most of the users. Raised the habit of paying. And the awareness of paying. Can you understand? Understand the after-sales. Understand the after-sales. Okay, I won't say anything else. And then the little red book e-commerce this year. Its one project advantage is mainly these. You can take a look. The cost is very low. Easy operation. Can be free of charge. Right? The platform has a flow of support on the e-commerce. Now there is a flow of support. Understand? Zero fans can also be on the list. You will find. When my account just started to be on the list. Twenty fans. Then the amount of money is relatively fast. The profit space is also relatively objective. This is probably. I won't say. You take a look. Okay. And then how to do the little red book e-commerce? First of all, its product source. 1688. Pinduoduo. Taobao. All right. All right. And then the source of traffic. The source of traffic on the little red book platform. Just two. Search traffic. Just the head traffic. The source of traffic on the head. Search traffic and promotion traffic. The rest is okay. The rest is okay. Then the search traffic accounts for 10%. And then the promotion traffic accounts for 90%. Okay. 90%. Understand? Then the difference in the way of playing. You can take a look at this. I won't say more. This. These things are not. Nothing important. Just to tell you. Just some. Things on the data. Promotion traffic. See? Search traffic. Then the difference between the little red book and Douyin. With the circle of friends. Douyin is a video. See? Mainstream or video. Little red book is a picture. You can also go to the transformation. Understand? Then with the circle of friends. The circle of friends is private. Little red book is public. See? Then emphasize. Notebook cover is very important. Any little red book notes. The cover is greater than anything. The cover is greater than anything. What I wrote here is the cover. Define life and death. Cover. Define life and death. This is not to fool you. Little red book cover is greater than anything. Greater than anything. The advantages of no source and source. This source source. This is nothing. Just source source. You are source source. No source source is no source source. Just follow your own. Just do it. Then what do you need to prepare? At least three mobile phones. Then register a little red book account. Then send a note to the number of numbers. Make a number in advance. Make a number in advance. You are now in a stage. It doesn't matter. You are like me. I just opened a number. Then today I opened seven or eight. Then it may open more. May open more. Then 5,000 mobile funds. 5,000 mobile funds. Then the main thing is the no source. Then the ID card needs at least two. Because you need to get a personal. You can go to a personal store first. I told him this yesterday. Go to a personal store first. If you don't open your personal store. After you open it, you go to a personal store. Personal store. Then the shop insurance. Personal store. And the personal store. Most of them are one or two thousand. One or two thousand. About a thousand dollars. Like this. Then if you say yes. If you don't go to the insurance. There is no way. When the user buys your stuff. There is no way to make WeChat payments. He can only pay through Alipay. Only through Alipay. So, including you guys. The same is true for opening a store. If you have someone. He has money in WeChat. He said I paid for it. I have no money. He needs to pay for your product. He is through WeChat payment. If you don't pay for the insurance. He can't. He can't pay through WeChat. You have to pay for the insurance. The user can only pay through WeChat. Understand? Otherwise, it can only be one payment method. Payment. Payment. I'll do this. I said the shop opens and closes. I actually told him this yesterday. Right? I told him in this live class yesterday. If you don't know. You can go to the live class yesterday. The content of the live class yesterday. You can just go and see it. Okay? This is the class. I told you yesterday. Basic operations. The address of the PC end. The address of the mobile phone end. And then there's the process of opening the store. Right? Product order process. I told you this yesterday. I'm not here. Just repeat it. Okay? Then you guys go and see it yourself. It's the goods. I'm not going to talk about this. This is the app. This is actually. I'll tell you later. Anyway, this is easier. How to open the store. I said this yesterday. I won't say much. Then the shop opens. Pay attention to the market. I've said all this. How to open. How do you open your mobile phone? How do you open it on the computer? If you don't know. Go to the class yesterday. Take a look at it yourself. And then how to go to this list. I said this yesterday. I won't say it. These are all the content I said yesterday. I won't say it. Okay? Then I'll tell you. Let me tell you. For example, you can take a look. How to make a notebook. Then I found that many students. The quality of this notebook is not very high. I'll tell you briefly. First of all, the behavior path of the user to brush a notebook. Hand-picked. Hand-picked search. The two biggest ones are this. The biggest two. You must remember. The source of the flow of small red book notes. Mainly two. One is to recommend hand-picked. One is to search. One is to promote traffic. One is to search traffic. And then what's the core of this?

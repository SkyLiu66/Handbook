I'm going to set it right down here. And so if we focus, we have the camera was just automatically set to the aperture at 11, the shutter speed at a 50th and the ISO at 1250. So let's see here, since we're shooting at a DSLR, let's focus on aperture for this example. Let's get the exposure right. And then I'm going to take in a photo of this example. Okay. And then now I'm going to get the same proper exposure with different settings. So what I'm going to do is bring down the aperture. So we have a much wider depth of field. Okay. And then I'm going to bring down the ISO so that we're not getting overexposed. And then our image is actually going to be a lot less grainy. And then I'm going to set the focus. I can even go down further on the aperture. And now I'm going to take the same exact photo. And you can see how that simple difference of changing the aperture, even if you're getting the same exposure value. That simple change in settings makes a much more dramatic and stylized image. So let's see the before and afters of these examples. Now I'm excited to see what kind of examples that you upload that are your before and after examples in the student Q&A section. I'll see you in the next lecture.",

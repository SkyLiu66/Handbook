To use cleverness to rule a country is to lead the country to ruin. To avoid cleverness in ruling a country is to lead the country to prosperity. Knowing the two alternatives is a pattern. Remaining aware of the pattern is a virtue. This dark and mysterious virtue is profound. It is opposite our natural inclination, but leads to harmony with the heavens. This chapter seems a little bit odd, especially to those of us who were raised in Western culture, on ideas of democracy and the power of individuals in government. Is Lao Tzu indicating that rulers should keep their subjects intentionally ignorant so that they cannot interfere in politics? It does kind of seem to read that way. I think it is fair to acknowledge that the idea of democracy is a very important part of the culture. I think it is fair to acknowledge that Lao Tzu probably never had any contact with any sort of democratic system of government before. If he had had any kind of exposure to democracy, would his position have been different? Obviously, it's impossible to say. Is it better for a ruler to keep the subjects ignorant? I don't know. I do think it is fair to say, however, that Taoism often teaches us that knowledge is not all it's cracked up to be. Although knowledge does have its benefits, it often leads a person astray. Probably one of the biggest issues with knowledge is that it is not always the same. It often leads to pride and self-righteousness. When we think that we know a good deal about things, we often try to play God with them. And this can lead to terrible results. I watched a super interesting video a while back from Veritasium about the man who invented the process of synthesizing ammonia to make nitrogen fertilizers, Fritz Haber. You should go and watch this video if you have some free time, because I think it's really worth taking a look at. Haber was prompted towards this invention by a panic caused by the realization that global population growth was beginning to outstrip the government. It's probably that this invention prevented an incalculably disastrous human crisis. In fact, it's estimated that around half of all people alive today simply could not have been if nitrogen fertilizers had never been invented. However, the story isn't all that black and white, because Fritz Haber later brought forth another invention that had a dramatic impact on humanity. Chlorine, phosphine, and mustard gas. If you know even a little bit about World War I, you'll know that nitrogen fertilizers were invented in the early 1900s. You'll know that being exposed to these kinds of gases was one of the most horrific things a soldier could experience in battle. Chlorine gas damages the air tract, causing buildup of fluid in the lungs, and eventually can cause a person to basically drown on dry land. Mustard gas causes severe chemical burns wherever it touches skin or tissue. Both are terrible ways to die. Haber justified the research and use of chemical weapons because he claimed that the quick and decisive victory they would ensure would in the long term save thousands of lives. However, he was wrong. Chemical weapons were used by both sides and did not prove decisive for either. World War I lasted four years with an estimated total 40 million military and civilian casualties. It is estimated that chemical weapons such as chlorine gas, phosphine gas, and mustard gas were the cause of over 1.3 million casualties and around 90,000 deaths. Incredibly, these chemical weapons have even been used more recently in Yemen, Iraq, Iran, and Syria, often against civilians. Unfortunately, this is one of those genies that never really gets back into the bottle. The tragedy doesn't even end there, however, because the Nazis later used a variant of pesticide gas invented by Haber to exterminate millions of Jews during the Holocaust. Fritz Haber was himself a Jew. Now, breaking this all down, I think we need to be careful about making judgments about people who we have never met and who lived under circumstances we never experienced. But I think this sobering story can serve as a pretty stark warning about how knowledge is a bit of a two-edged sword. We shouldn't assume that greater knowledge always leads to greater outcomes. Knowledge is dangerous if it's not paired with intuition and a closeness with Dao. You know how Fritz Haber invented those fertilizers that saved all those people? Well, even this invention isn't without downsides. I personally used to live within miles of a lake where these kinds of fertilizers leaked over time and nearly destroyed an entire ecosystem. Fertilizers may allow vastly increased production of food, but they can also have really terrible impacts on the environment. Is it worth it? I certainly don't think I'm in a place to make a judgment like that. What I'm trying to show here is that these things are often not all that black and white. Now, to bring this all back to the chapter, I guess I really don't have a conclusion to give you guys about it. I think I'd rather have you form your own opinion here. Is it better for a people to be educated or kept in ignorance? Knowledge certainly has a lot of dangers. However, on the other hand, despotic governments are often able to do what they do largely by keeping their subjects in ignorance. Maybe the benefits of knowledge outweigh the cost. What I'm really trying to do here is give you guys some food for thought and to impress upon you that there are costs for ignorance as well as costs for knowledge. Everything comes at a cost. Maybe there is no right answer. Maybe there is a lesser of two evils. You're gonna have to decide that for yourself. At the end of the day, I think the best thing we can do is to stay close to intuition, so that we can be guided on how to use and how not to use knowledge in our own personal lives. So with that, I want to thank you all for watching and I will see you all tomorrow for chapter 66. Peace and blessings.",

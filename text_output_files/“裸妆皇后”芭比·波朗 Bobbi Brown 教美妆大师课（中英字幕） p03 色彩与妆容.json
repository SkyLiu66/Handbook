It's about finding what looks good on you, and it's about using color, whether it's in makeup, your home, your clothes, to just be more flattering and just work with your style. Even though I like things really simple, there's things that make a difference, whether it's your earrings, whether it's your bracelet, a big watch you wear, your nail color. There's ways to do simple adaptations. And one moment I'll never forget, this absolutely stunning model came to visit me at work, Yasmin Laban. And she came into work and she was wearing a white Hanes t-shirt, a pair of jeans, no makeup on, but short red nails. I've been wearing them ever since. I just think it looks cool, it looks polished, it's together. So my normal Bobbi ponytail, no makeup, my nails are always done. I learned a lot about coloring in makeup and in skin from understanding undertones. When I was a makeup artist starting in the industry and I would buy foundations, I would put it on and I couldn't blend it. So I would say, oh, should I blend it down into the neck? And I realized that doesn't make sense. I need to find a foundation that actually matches the skin. It didn't. I discovered that women and men, we have natural undertones. Yellow, orange, some have pink. Even within each ethnicity, there are a giant range. And many women, especially women who have dark skin, they have different needs than the fair women. The fairest women have a lot of pink, some women. And you've got to counteract the pink. Yellow is not going to work because it's going to look yellow on the skin. Yellow is not going to work because it's going to look yellow on the skin. So that's when they need a little bit more cooler tones. For many darker skin women, especially women that are mixed, you might need more than one foundation. Often women have yellow undertones or orange undertones. Some really dark women are more red or blue. And if you have dark circles, there's different tones. For Indian women, an orangey tone is amazing. For women that are more of a dark, they need a little bit of yellow undertones. For Indian women, an orangey tone is amazing. For women that are lighter skin, they need almost one that has no yellow in it, a little bit of pink. That makes a difference. For black women, sometimes you have to cut it. With a little bit of a pinky tone, we'll cut the darkness under the eyes. For myself, I go with a little bit of yellowy peach. That works in the dark corners under my eyes. So everything really varies, but I like to go with a little bit of pink. I like to go with a little bit of pink. I like to go with a little bit of pink. I like to go with a little bit of pink. The best time to really look at your skin and make sure that you are using exactly what's right is when you have no makeup on. You should have a makeup artist look at you without makeup on. You should look at your own skin without makeup on. And that way you could almost assess what you need. I always like choosing colors for women that really mimic the natural things I see in their skin. I mean, blush, I think, always looks best when it looks natural. And to me, natural means it's the right color that when you pinch your cheek, when you exercise, it's the right color. And the most amazing thing about color, there's different variations of color. So just because someone says, oh, I don't look good in a beige shirt, guess what? There's so many different tones. Sometimes one that has a little more pink is more flattering, sometimes more golden. So the great thing about color is it enhances you. Don't be afraid of color. How do you know if color will work on you? If you look in the mirror and you like it, it works. If you are someone that looks great in a bright color on your lip, don't be afraid. Go for it. Also, sometimes makeup changes colors, by the way. Women with oily skin, you could pick the most perfect colors. And at the end of the day, it oxidizes and becomes more orange. So those are things that only a woman would know if she looks in the mirror and says, this doesn't look right. But I always say start with the basics, start with your nude colors and then go wherever you want to go with it. To me, nude makeup is makeup where the colors are right for your skin. I started doing nude makeup in the 90s. Some people say it's not a good look. People have told me that I was kind of the queen of nude makeup. It's when they first discovered it. Because makeup was really hard to, I think, make yourself look like you're not wearing any makeup. The no makeup makeup is my favorite kind of makeup on myself. And if you could master the no makeup makeup, it's amazing. So nude makeup is not beige. It's not washed out. It's not flat. It's not monochromatic. Nude makeup is the foundation is the color of your skin. Your blush is the color of your cheek. Your lipstick is the color of your lips. Your eyeshadow are the color of your eyelids. And that's it. That's nude makeup. And so my nude makeup will only work on someone that has my exact coloring. Your nude makeup is perfect for you. You really have to understand that women have different color lips. And it affects the way lipstick looks. Which is why if you've ever told your girlfriend how much you love that pink lipstick, and you put it on, it doesn't look good on you, you have different color lips. So if you want a pink lipstick, you can either go muted, bright, orange tone. There's so many ways you can go. But it really does. It doesn't matter what color lips you have. And also textures really affect color. So if you're someone that says, I really want a bright color, but I don't look good in it, try it sheer. Try a gloss. Try a red gloss. Try a plum gloss. Easier to wear than a matte. Matte is the most unforgiving application. And it's a statement lipstick. So if you don't like red lipstick, don't worry about it. So many women say, I'm having such trouble finding the perfect red lipstick. I say stop looking. Find something else. Natural lip color sometimes looks the most beautiful with a clear gloss. When I was a young makeup artist, people would teach me how to correct things on people's faces. How to correct a dark lip. How to correct an uneven lip. How to correct too thin of a lip. How to correct too thick of a lip. I don't believe in correcting. I believe in doing whatever the lip looks like and enhancing it. So I love to choose lipstick when lips are different colors that you could literally almost mimic the natural colors of the lip. I think it's the most beautiful. So there is a color for you depending on what you want. And just because it's trendy at the moment doesn't mean you have to wear it. Please let me know what you think. One video at a time. Hope you enjoy the video. Гродно Лидинг 30",

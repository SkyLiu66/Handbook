That's because our key light is basically all the way on, and our fill light is all the way on. And that's giving a very bright, kind of like beauty blogger style that actually works really well for women. Because if you think of like a mob boss, like a Sopranos or something, they're always going to have very dramatic, low-key lighting. So let's kind of experiment here and see the different kind of lighting scenarios that we can get, depending on the look you're going for. And what I want to mention is, if your video vibe is bright and happy, and you're doing like an unboxing video for some type of thing, you know. Hold on. Yeah, I'm like, wait, what am I doing? What am I trying to say? If you're doing an unboxing video for some type of product, you want bright, good lighting from both sides. If you're doing something that's a lot more moody, maybe it's a documentary, something that's more stylized, more cinematic, you want to have actually the majority of your lighting only coming from one side of the subject. So let's kind of experiment here. I'm going to turn down this light all the way. And now we can instantly see. That we have highlights on the subject's left side of the face, her right, our left. And we can see the difference between this style of low-key lighting versus this style of high-key lighting. So what we're going to do now is, like I mentioned, we have a really cool, more contrasting looking light setup. And what I want to do is add a key, excuse me, add a rim light, or it's also called a hair light, which is going to. Especially because she has dark hair and a dark shirt. It's going to add a really nice highlight to our subject that's going to separate them even more from the background. So let's go ahead and see what that looks like. I'm going to grab this light. Hopefully this one works. I'm going to grab this light here. And the reason I actually moved it from this side to this side is because our main light source is here, lighting this side of the face. If I do this. The rim light here, then there's going to be the main light source from this angle and then the rim light. It actually looks better to have light and dark contrasting. So we'll see what that looks like. And the key to this is not to be lighting the front of the subject. We already have that squared away and looking good. So let's see what that looks like. And here's the before. And here is the after. And here's the after.",

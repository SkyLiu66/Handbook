His bones are soft and his muscles weak, but his grasp is firm. He knows nothing yet of mating, but his organ stirs, for his vigor is at its height. He will cry all day, but his voice will remain loud, for his harmony is at its height. If you know harmony, you know what is constant. If you know what is constant, you are enlightened. If your mind forces your breath, you misuse your strength. You misuse your strength. What expands too much is bound to collapse. This is not the way of Tao. What goes against Tao soon declines. There are many instances in the Tao Te Ching of Lao Tzu taking inspiration from infants. Actually, this is a common theme in many other philosophies and religions as well. Many of these regressions are based on the fact that Tao Te Ching is a Taoist. They regard the infant as pure and innocent, and they propose that later problems develop from experiences and influences the child is exposed to as it matures. These schools of thought often parallel the process of self-actualization as returning to the innocence and inherent goodness of the child, while maintaining the wisdom and perspective that were gained along the way. It is interesting also to note the nature of the human life cycle. When a human is born, it progresses gradually from lack of activity and total dependence on others to abundance activity. Then, as it nears the end of its life cycle and becomes old, it increasingly begins to revert back to less activity and increasing physical dependence on others. Perhaps this is a physical manifestation within the human life cycle that we can learn from. While there are many aspects of childhood that we necessarily leave behind as we mature, there are aspects that perhaps we would do well to adopt all throughout our lives. Lao Tzu highlights several of these throughout the chapter. Starting with the beginning of the chapter, we learn that the child is a human being. In the end of the chapter, it does seem a bit odd to claim that newborn babies are not attacked by wild animals, when we see in nature that actually predators seem to prefer attacking infants because of how vulnerable they are. I saw several different explanations for this as I did some research for the video. Some sources propose that Lao Tzu is speaking only figuratively, and that the predators mentioned in the chapter are representative of the many worries and cares that plague us as adults. Other explanations have theorized that Lao Tzu was not actually referring to a child at all, but to this day, he is a human being. I don't know if there is any way to say for sure what Lao Tzu meant by this, although to me the second explanation does seem especially plausible. I've also seen people say that perhaps Lao Tzu was just engaging in a bit of wishful thinking, but I do personally find this idea pretty unlikely, since Lao Tzu is so characteristically concerned with observing the universe as it is, and not as the self wants it to be. If you'll indulge me, I think that the idea of Lao Tzu being a human being is a bit of a mystery. If you'll indulge me, I think I might venture so far as to add a theory of my own. If you think about it, while some infants do perish to wild animals, and certainly this would have been much more common in Lao Tzu's time, many do not. In fact, I think it would be pretty fair to say that the majority do not. What is the reason for this? Among other things, it is because they are able to count on the protection of individuals stronger and more capable of dealing with these dangers than they are. In the infant's case, this usually takes the form of parents, but in the long run, this is just a form of parent-to-parent relationship. But in the lives of us adults, I am inclined to assign this protector role to the Tao. Babies do not try to train with weapons or kung fu or build elaborate houses to protect themselves from animals, firstly because they are incapable of doing these things, and secondly because they are able to depend on others who are capable of these tasks. Similarly, while we adults are capable of defending ourselves from wild animals, there are many dangers out there that just kind of happen to us, and we are more or less powerless to fight, such as disease, famine, and even death. Such as disease, famine, and even death. Such as disease, famine, and even death. Such as disease, famine, and even death. Such as disease, famine, and even death. Such as disease, famine, and even death. Civil unrest, economic conditions, and many others. While modern developments in medicine, government, and economics strive to overcome these challenges, they will probably never go away completely. While I'm not suggesting that we live with our heads in the sand, I do believe that there is a lot of the world that is just out of our control. Therefore, rather than constantly worry about persistent dangers that we can do very little about, I think we are much better off trusting these things to the universe, and concerning ourselves primarily with following our intuitions and dreams. and drawing closer to Tao. Paradoxically, our resolve to do this, even in the face of growing global concerns, may even be the thing that allows us to act in ways that will go great lengths in solving the problems we would otherwise be worrying about. People who are in harmony with Tao will do good and overcome opposition naturally. People who concern themselves too much with complex problems act in fear and self-preservation, and tend to only make these problems worse. As in so many areas of life, the only way to really be free from these problems, problems, is to first let them go. Once we have done this, we will be in a position to really do something about them, if that's what our intuitions inspire us to do. Striving for solutions is not the answer. Being in harmony with Tao is the answer. This harmony will foster solutions naturally, but in order for this to happen, we need to make harmony the goal. The chapter says, If you know harmony, you know what is constant. If you know what is constant, you are enlightened. The world does not need more extensively thought out programs or agendas. The world needs more enlightened individuals. If you're following the channel closely, I know that I keep coming back to this theme and I do apologize if it's getting redundant. I guess it's just been on my mind a lot lately. If these discussions do interest you, check out the discord, because we talk about this kind of stuff all the time. And I do just want to say, thank you so much for watching, and I will see you all tomorrow for chapter 56. Peace and blessings.",

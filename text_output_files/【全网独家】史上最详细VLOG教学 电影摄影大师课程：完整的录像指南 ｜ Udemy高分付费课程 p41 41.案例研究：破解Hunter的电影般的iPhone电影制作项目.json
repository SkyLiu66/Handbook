    "data": " Cool, so Hunter, thank you so much for coming on as a guest speaker for this part of the course. So far, the students have really dove into how to use lighting and how to really set up the camera to get the best looking video possible. And you've been on my radar for a while. And, you know, we've kind of connected on a few projects here and there, but I saw your iPhone commercial, let's just call it. And it's really the perfect part in the course and really the perfect topic that I wanted to have you on to kind of speak and go through that amazing project that I saw and give some tips, give things that are applicable for smartphone shooters and all types of new filmmakers. That sounds exciting, dude. Thanks for having me. Yeah, of course. And then what's just maybe a little mini background. I'll have some cutaway shots, a montage of your Instagram, your website. What's like, you know, your elevator pitch of, you know, where you are today? Yeah. So to your listeners, my name is Hunter. I, run a business called unemployed movement currently, and I've been in the digital marketing and content creation industry, if you want to call it that for about seven years now, and I've gone through kind of different models that I worked in an agency right out of school in Colorado. And I was like in the action sports world and then moved to California and was a freelancer doing a lot of just, you know, freelancing content, whether that's making social media content, doing photography jobs. A lot of my, I think, unique, uh, skill lies in digital marketing. I think that's a little bit of differentiation factor between like a filmmaker. Um, cause I do come from more of the marketing background in the sense of, uh, like shooting courses and managing podcasts, um, more so than I guess you can say like kind of the creative industry. Um, so kind of to bring up the concept of the iPhone videos and why I kind of actually put a little bit more energy and understanding that type of stuff. Cause it is a little less, um, equipment heavy, right? We're not using like DSLRs or cinema cameras. We're using a little iPhone in my pocket was more from the perspective of understanding, like that is how most people are using tools, whether not necessarily filmmakers, but just influencers, creators, people who want to use social media to build their personal brand. Um, so using that and understanding that from a perspective that that's how a lot of people are going to use it. So not so much only filmmakers. So that's kind of my approach to understanding that stuff. And especially in the sense that nowadays with Instagram reels and Tik TOK and all of these, uh, ways that we use social media, a lot of people are using the more basic tools to do those things. And I think understanding that even if you are a high level filmmaker is important and I think it can be easy to shun it because it's less fancy, you know what I mean? Um, but at the same time, it's really important because that's how most people are using their equipment and, uh, using social media. 100%. I agree with you. It took me some time for my filmmaker ego to kind of let go of like even using iPhone stuff. And now I'm actually kind of incorporating it into more higher, more advanced projects in a way that's fun, where all of a sudden there's a vertical video inside a 16 by nine normal format project that's high quality. And then it cuts away to something that's just kind of more raw and feels fun. But the thing that I loved about what we're going to dive into your project is that from the trained eye and the untrained eye, I mean, it looked quality, you know what I mean? So I really want to kind of go, you know, frame by frame and kind of a how and a why you did the things that you do. So I'm going to go ahead and start with that. I'm going to go ahead and start with that. I'm going to show you guys a little bit of the process that you, that you did for that project kind of going through, you're going to do a screen cap for that, um, to kind of show people, you know, it's the biggest thing is that yeah, the equipment should never be holding you back. So I love, you know, your approach to it and kind of accepting this new wave of mobile filmmaking genre. I don't even know what to really call it. Yeah. It's actually interesting. One more point on that, like in the realm of Instagram and Tik TOK land, I noticed that a loft, often, I'm not sure what it's called, but it's like a lot of things that you do in your life. Um, like you're doing something that you're doing in your life, often the clips and little, uh, reels, um, that go viral are often like the most simple ones, like somebody like, you know, walking around with an iPhone and doing the crazy, like, like jujitsu waves. And it's like, that's kind of dumb, but it looks cool. And it's like, maybe because it's novel, right. It's unexpected. It's something that you wouldn't see even amongst filmmakers. So it's kind of, I think that's interesting. It is interesting. And yeah, the last thing I'll say about that is coming from a more filmmaking background, it's like pointing the camera at yourself and holding the camera was just like, or holding the camera and talking. As a filmmaker, you were always pointing the camera in front of you, quietly standing behind the camera as a creative. And now it's just so funny. It's all kind of mixed together. But yeah, man, I love the intro. Let's kind of hop into your video. Maybe we can play it all the way through so that students can see it. And then we'll go and you'll kind of dissect it. Great. I actually have it in two layers too. So I stuck a GoPro on my head so you can actually see the behind the scenes shot. And that'll give you some context. I'm going to pull it up right now and I will just play it. All right. So first off, the first thing that came to mind when I thought about creating this video, I'm a teacher. I have a course like yourself. So I really wanted to show the process of creation instead of the end product. So that's why I put together this piece. Also, my students are, I guess I'd say creators, not so much filmmakers. They're kind of in the realm of YouTubers. I hate the word influencers, but people who have a personal brand. And so that was the process of that. So I wanted to create a video specifically for this video. I live in Southern California. I wanted to create, you know, something that was a destination based video. This is a coffee shop right in Venice. You know, and everybody knows the Venice skate park. Everybody knows the boardwalk. It's very nostalgic. That's why I chose this location. And then I just wanted to tell a story. After all, like any video, whether it's shot on an iPhone or DSLR or anything, like story is the base of everything. So my mindset was like, I'm going to just put together a little sequence that tells me what I'm going to do. And then I'm going to put together a little sequence that tells a story. Something very simple. Going out and getting coffee and going and like watching the skaters at the Venice skate park. So that was kind of my mindset. And this is a pretty like simple sequence where it's just very linear, right? There's nothing, you know, dynamic. It's just like establishing shot, which is why I chose this shot because it's kind of like showing the coffee location, then cutting into, you know, more establishing shots. And then it really opens up to, you know, the subject really is my girlfriend, Amy, right here. So just going through different shots. That's like not showing the full environment. And then I chose to open up halfway through to see, okay, that's the Venice boardwalk. You can't really tell in the beginning. Then you could clearly see where it is. And then just ending with the scene at the skate park. So how much of this was blocked? Was shot listed, storyboarded? And how much was just kind of, okay, concept, I want to do, like you mentioned, destination, cool vibe, very modern, kind of hipster. You know, the coffee thing is very like big. Was it, okay, I know where I want to shoot and I'm just going to do it. Or was it like shot list? Here's shot one, shot two, shot three. Good question. I would say like 90% of the time in any project I do, whether it is just, you know, a fun Sunday morning or actually like a paid gig, I'm very analytical. I'm very analytical and structured. Ironically, like my girlfriend, I work with her and she like makes fun of me to the degree that I need to know every single angle and movement. In this case, I actually just was more free flowing. I knew like I wanted to put together certain shots. Like I knew I wanted to get establishing shots at the coffee shop. I knew I wanted to get a shot of the sign, but I did not shot list it out in order. But I did just go and shoot like two or three shots of the sign. And then I shot a few shots of the window. Then I got different angles and movements of the barista creating the latte. So it was very like, even though there was not an awareness around exactly the shot, I knew I was going to get certain shots and I was going to basically give myself as much room in an edit. So I would get, so I wouldn't like, you know, I imagine you can go through this process where you go out and you shoot and there's something that's just one thing that's missing. You're like, God, I wish I had, you know, some type of panning movement to put here. If I don't have a shot list put together, I generally go out and do like four or five different versions of the same thing, like the same shots of the sign with different movements, whether it's like pushing in, same shots of the coffee barista or different shots of the barista doing that same action. And that's generally how I kind of go into any shoot because it just gives you more freedom if you were to need to. You kind of see it here. I mean, this is pretty like typical content creator practice, but using movement to match shots. So like I would come in and like, even though I didn't use that, that, that drop movement, I had that there in case I needed to. So I can just cut that out. But I did use it in the second shot where I pulled down and then match it with the shot of the cups. So that's kind of something I would go into and just like making sure that I have the movements that I need if I need them. And then if not, then I have other shots to pull from. And this is where I don't want to have the same transition for every single shot, but I do want to have some movement, something that is capturing somebody's eye. And also it's unique because this is an iPhone, right? Most people who are shooting on their iPhone aren't using more sophisticated camera movement transitions. Probably just kind of just holding it like this, right? So I wanted to think, how could I use something that is a little bit more in the filmmaking tool kit, so to speak, in an experience that's less sophisticated? So that's why I chose the movements in the beginning. Obviously. Going through this whole thing, it's cutting to a beat. It's just kind of like keeps the sequence flowing like organically. Using a mask. Once again, not something that you would see with somebody shooting on an iPhone. It's a little more sophisticated. And obviously just like leading people through the experience of like starting from the boardwalk and getting to the skate park. And that's pretty much it. All of it's just very simple cuts. And then just ending with the shot and just kind of like... The kind of the culmination of chicks getting coffee, going for a walk, watching all the skater bros. And so what you're saying is basically when you see the shot in mind or you already have it planned and written down, you're shooting it. Yeah. Three, four or five times to get what is it that you're getting? It's like, I know it's like that feeling you get the shot, you know? Okay, cool. I got it. But for you, what is that? When do you know that that's going to go in the edit? In a process like this where it's not as structured and exact, I kind of just look for is the composition good? Is it in focus? Is my hand shaky? You know, like when you're using hand movement, I was using obviously just my iPhone. I didn't have a stabilizer or anything. I just want to make sure I have at least two like clean takes. Something I know like I could use that. It's not shaky. Things are in focus. There's not somebody in the background that I don't want to be there. I'll kind of just analyze all of those kind of check marks. And if it passes, then I'll... give it a green light. Yeah, you're shooting all the stuff and then you're using like 10%, 20% of the shots and the rest is kind of throwaway stuff. On the technical side, were you using like Pro Camera or Filmic Pro? Or were you actually using the native video recorder on the phone? Yeah, I believe actually for this I used... You can see it on there on the iPhone screen, the Moment app. Particularly because it allows you to very quickly change the frame rate. Obviously, I shot this all in 60 frames so I can slow it down. And it allows you to control the aperture, shutter speed, and all of the functions that you couldn't necessarily do. I don't believe you can in the native camera roll camera in iOS. So that's a really great app. And obviously, it shows you like the exposure and balance and all the extra stuff that you wouldn't have also, which is good.",

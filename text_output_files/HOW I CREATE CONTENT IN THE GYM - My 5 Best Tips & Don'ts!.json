    "data": " What is up YouTube family? Welcome back to a new video. We're in the gym and today we're doing something I don't think I've ever done a video like this but as you guys are following what I'm doing and I do this like professional can you say that? Maybe you can say that I don't really know I don't see myself as a professional but I've been doing this for like six or seven years now and there's a lot of questions about how to create content and how do I create my content? What like what do I think about? What is like my thumb rules? Like what rules do I have? What type of videos am I creating and why? And like what is my idea behind my videos? And that's what I was gonna gonna try to show you that today just how I create content. What you need to do as I am a professional. So many times when I get to the gym many times I have a plan but many times I don't have a plan. So I'm like what is my idea behind my videos? And that's what I was going to try to show you that today. Just how I create content. What you need to do as I am a professional. So many times when I get to the gym many times I don't and I just like record my own my like my own workouts because I believe that you have to have a mix between where I guide you through something like this is the best exercises for back or this is how you target biceps or this is how you do that and that. But then also I really want to show you like how I train and that's why I years ago started with my real and raw videos like the swipe videos. And I'm like I'm gonna do this and that and I'm gonna do this and that and I'm gonna do this and it feels like when it comes to training it feels like swipe videos are really coming back that people love to see swipes just like when it comes to training. Today I actually have a plan and I'm gonna record my back session for today. What you need to have really convenient to have is a tripod. This one is yeah you can you can install it as you like if you want to higher lower if you want to angle it or whatever have to have when you're creating content because you can't go around putting up your phone like leaning it against something because you will not have the right angles maybe for lower body not for upper body. So you need a tripod. So we're gonna go to the first exercise and I'm gonna give you next tips. I am training upper body. Which means that can't have the tripod too low? I also like to create content in different angles. So I will start with one angle for one set because normally you do at least two sets of one exercise then you can move the camera to the next location or angle at location angle to get like the full chicos of the exercise and to So, I will start with one angle for one set because normally you do at least two sets of one exercise then you can move the camera to the next location or angle at not location angle to get like the full sites of the exercise on to original video and you can see if it fits or does it fit but I shades here as I made all the Guardian video yet you know, if I'm trying to stand here here. più sources. Yes. and two, instead of just putting the camera in one angle, it gives it more life when you're moving it around and seeing the exercise from different angles, which can also help when you're looking on the form of the exercise. So we're going to start with one angle and then we're going to move it. So for example, when you are recording a reel, like I am doing now, I always focus on having more roof and less floor. Because I will look taller and it's a much more flattering angle in my opinion. And it just looks better for the eye. And then obviously when you are editing, you can zoom in and zoom out on where you want it to, if you want to highlight it, like when I'm taking on the straps or when you're loading off weights or something like that, then you can adjust. In a better way as well. And if it is a swipe video, I will definitely just lower it so you are in the middle of the frame instead of lower on the frame. And that is basically because when you're editing swipe videos, you can't move like the frame. You can't move it up and down. Otherwise you need to go into. Like you need to cut it yourself. So if you don't want to cut it, it's much better to focus on being in the middle of the frame for swipe videos. For reels, more roof, less floor. So next exercise. The thing when you are recording reels, a thumb rule is to change the frame every two seconds to keep like the viewers stuck to the video. For as long as you possibly can. Instagram is weird today. We all know that. But still this thumb rule is still something to follow if you want to create reels, make them like go fast and change the frame every two seconds. So the material that you have, you can like the good thing is that you can use the material as a swipe. But also create a reel. From. Same material. So use the same material more than once. Work smart. Not more. I'm not going to use it. I hate this. Make sure you have the right equipment for your record. I'm going to use this. I'm going to use this. I'm going to use this. I'm going to use this. I'm going to use this. I'm going to use this. I'm going to use this. I'm going to use this. I'm going to use this. I'm going to use this. Now. Now. God. You are recording. I can't. Now. Collaborate. In life. Now. Now. Now. So obviously this takes a lot of time. I'm not going to lie. Like sometimes when I record, I don't want to record. Because like for a lot of you, you know that the gym is like your therapy. And the place where you feel like you can just focus on yourself. And most of, I'm not complaining, but most of the times I don't have that anymore. Because I always record. I always have a camera rolling. And like obviously I take workouts as well without recording. And I truly enjoy them so, so much. Because they're rare. And I appreciate them so much. But this takes a lot of time. It's not just coming to the gym. And recording something and then just throw it up on Instagram. You need to have a plan. And you need to like plan whatever you want to do in the gym. To, because like obviously I'm here to create content to help people. And then I can't just go here and don't have a plan. So it takes a lot of time. So every creator should, you should respect every single creator. Because they, I can only speak for myself. But I put like. I've always put my life into what I do. And my time and my effort. And it truly takes a lot of time. Even though I love creating content. I really do. So don't misunderstand what I'm saying. But yeah, it takes a lot of time and effort to create good content. We're going to move the camera a little bit. What is going on? Why? Like can you imagine? People that don't know what I'm doing. They're like, what the f***? Why? Why are you sitting like that? Is she farting? Pooping? What is she doing? So whenever I'm recording, I'm trying to think exactly what I would do if I was here just to train. Like when I'm taking out, taking off my jacket or my sweater or pants. Or like taking off my pants. Or like taking off my pants. Or like taking off my pants. Or like taking off my shoes. Or like taking off my shoes. Every step I take. Because that's content that you can use to get like the full picture of the whole like. So you get a vibe of what we're doing in the gym. Like from when you like walk into the gym until you go. As you get like the whole, yeah, the whole vibe. And every single, that's why I move the frames around so much and the angles. It's because it's easier to, to, you know, to get the whole picture. It's easier to, to edit. To something that is more alive than just the camera standing still on one place all the time. So I'm just trying to. I definitely don't like all the angles. That's how we are. We don't like all angles of ourselves. Sometimes I use them. Sometimes I don't. You just have to find like the angles that you feel comfortable or that you're happy with. Because in the end, it's you that are creating the content. And you should definitely feel the vibe of the content yourself before you post it. We're going to move to the next exercise. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . So obviously, I know I'm really spoiled with the gym with no people. Because my gym isn't crowded at all. And I know that all people don't have that benefit of training when it's less people in the gym. And if you want to record without people walking into the camera, that can be tricky. And as I said, moving angles to angles is good, but if you don't have that opportunity, you can still work with zoom in, zoom out, for it to always happen something every two seconds. You don't have to move the camera around. Sometimes I just let it be in one place, and I work with zoom in and zoom out. One thing, though, I want to highlight is that from the beginning, it wasn't meant to... The gym wasn't meant to be a place where we record. This has happened over time, and I still think it's so important to respect the people around you. I would never, ever be angry at someone that accidentally walks into the camera and into the camera, and into the camera, and into the frame. I would never. Because I'm there to record, but they are there to train. They're in the gym to train, which we all are. It's not normal to have a camera in the gym, even though it is normal today. But we still need to respect our gym members and the people around you in the gym. You can't be mad at someone walking into the camera. I can be in the gym any time during the day, but I pick the times when I know it's less people because I don't want to disturb anyone. And you should give the people in the gym, you should give them space. Yeah, I really think it's important to highlight this because I see videos and content too often when people get mad and get annoyed and hang out people on social medias because they're doing something in the background. But you're not allowed to record anyone that hasn't given you permission to record them. That's something that you need to remember. And I always, always, always respect the people around me. Always. And I'm here to record when less people are here. Sometimes no one is here. So that's convenient for me, but I know that if you're listening to this and you want to create your own content, and you have a busy gym, yeah, that will be a problem. So you need to be really creative and maybe do workouts in a corner or as long as you just respect people around you or blur them or whatever, because they haven't given you the permission to be in your frame. Let's go to the next exercise. Oh, it's content. Everything is content. Content. The more stupid you are, the better. Show people. The more... The more you show, you grow. The more you show, you grow. Oh, exact. Okay. Hey. I'm so fucking ready. I don't know if I should... This is good, Joss. Searching for the good light. Lift up your tits. So, as I said before, creating content takes a lot of time. And during my years, I recorded content first, and then I trained, which wasn't really optimal for my own progress. And then I trained, which wasn't really optimal for my own progress. And also, it didn't end my life. And also, when you go... As I did before, I went to the gym, and I had days when I recorded content. And those days were not like... They were a rest day, but they didn't become a rest day. because it was really... I recorded four or five videos per day. Not every day, but the days when I rested for my hour workouts and sometimes I also like recorded the same day as I trained which wasn't as I said good for my own progress so nowadays I just try to I record my own workouts and I try to record as long like I record and train in the same time to save time because I have business to run I have my family I have my my my son that I want to like spend time with obviously and it's just really hard to get everything the puzzle the life puzzle to you know so I'm just trying to be smart with what I do and that's why I've been starting to record my own videos and like my own videos my own workouts more because I don't have the time to be in the gym and record content like I did before when I posted four times per day and speaking of YouTube we are about 3 000 people subscribers from reaching 1 million subscribers on YouTube that's insane you guys that's insane not gonna talk about that because I'm gonna start crying as I am really a sensitive person over here but I truly truly appreciate every single one of you for being here with me and for doing this together with me for so many years I'm up yeah seven years now with doing content recording every step I take so I I understand when people come to me and say that it feels like I know you but you don't know me because I always like I've shared my life for seven years every step and I truly I love my job and I love what I do so yeah I hope this video will help you a little bit if you do I hope you have a great day and I'll see you in the next video bye and the first like the first thing I always always always say is to when you want to create your own channel and your own Instagram or YouTube or TikTok or whatever be yourself like that's that's the first ever rule and like the only thing that you should stick to is to be yourself and show people who you are yeah we have one more exercise left so now one what did you say it was called? one third one third of the job is now done which is recording now you have the editing part left which you can edit everything and most people post like all the other stuff you can't edit but you need to but you need to have a red thread courtyard which many times are so much more important than people think. Like you can obviously upload a video and say nothing, and it can go really good. I personally don't like to do that. I like to get my personal touch into the video of what my mindset was when I was training, what my struggles were, what I liked the most, how I felt, if I felt strong, if I felt like I was struggling, whatever. I like to put my mind, my thoughts into the video as well. So the caption is obviously really important. As you might understand, the man behind the camera is the one recording and editing for YouTube. But for Instagram, I do all my videos myself. I edit all my videos on either my phone or computer, mostly on my phone because it's easier to move around. I can still edit while I'm in the house when Colin is home or when I need to walk Ari or stuff like that. I can't take the computer with me and go with Ari. But I can still edit while. I like multitasking. That's how I do it. And that's how I need to do it with my life. I really hope that you liked this video. A really different video. As I said, I've never done a video like this before where I talk about how I edit. I can also say that now you might wonder if you need to post everything. I'm not sure if you need to post everything every single day. And no, you don't. But you still need to be consistent with your content if you want to grow on Instagram or if you want to grow on TikTok or whatever platform we're talking about. You need to be consistent because you can't post one video and then wait for like a week or three weeks or something like that and then post another one. And as I said in the beginning, like mix your content, like my content that I record in the gym. I mix that together with guides, on how to do pull-ups, like do's and don'ts, how I do hip thrusts with like my life, with my family, when I do like these outfit videos that I really like, how I dress outside the gym, really fun as well. So I just try to mix these together. Food, also really good to incorporate in this. And you don't have to post every single day, but stay consistent and post at least like... I try Monday till Friday. And then I have the weekend off. But then you can do it as you like and what fits your days. We're done for today.

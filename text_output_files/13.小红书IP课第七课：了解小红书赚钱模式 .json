    "data": " you you you you you you you you you you you you you you Let's get to work. Today, I'm going to be talking about what's often calledkilogram techniques in the seventh lesson, which is about the way to make money. Before this lesson, we talked about how to set up a platform, and about the knowledge about the platform. We also talked about how to make content, select topics, find a target account, and get the cover and title. The most important part is that we did so much in the beginning, but we actually did it for the commercialization of the last step. We can't say that we will always be at the VIP spot. So, the commercialization part of the blog's career is to let the blog's IP path enter the closed loop, which is a very important part of the cycle. So, we also used two lessons to talk about the way to make money in the book and the specific way to convert it. We also talked about the way to convert it in the previous lesson. First, do you know how to convert in the book? This is the first question. The second question is, do you have a plan for how to convert your account? You can put your answer on the screen. Let me see if anyone else has any questions about how to convert. Someone said that they mainly want to use the internet to connect to the ad. I hope that my lesson today will be helpful for you. Ad conversion is a very basic thing. Okay, let's go back to the personal influence formula that we talked about before. Position plus platform plus content plus business model. The two lessons we talked about are about business models. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. After we get through our business model, our entire IP network can enter the positive cycle. So, it is quite necessary to make positive feedback on making money. We will talk about three parts of this lesson. The first part is about how to convert in the book. The second part is about the thinking of conversion. You must listen to the key points of this part. Okay. The key point of this part is that this is the core part of this lesson. It can also eliminate a lot of people's misunderstandings. You must have the right thinking about conversion so that you can really make money on the small book platform. The third part is about how to operate the ad conversion. Okay, let's move on to the first part. The first part is how to convert to the small book platform. I don't know if you know what conversion methods there are on the small book platform. Let's take a look at some of the common conversion methods on the small book platform. First, we divide it into official channels and non-official channels. The official channel is mainly the book store. The book store is the small book store. You can sell products in the book store. You can bring goods through notes and live broadcasts. You can make money through e-commerce. You can write some experience notes. This is mainly for conversion. You can't make money directly, but you can get a lot of good products. But this is usually used by ordinary people. There are some accounts that have their own plans. You can't just go and get these products. Okay. You can't write your own experience notes. You can't experience everything. It will mess up your entire account. So, I don't recommend that you use the common conversion method. You can't have a lot of fans. You can just use any product and you'll be satisfied. I don't recommend that. Then, live broadcasts. The small book platform has also released a new product, which is the e-commerce. This is related to live broadcasts. Everyone knows about it. Dong Jie and Zhang Xiaohui, right? They broadcast live broadcasts on the small book platform. They are self-made. It's not like other platforms that are like a seductive live broadcast. The one that the small book defines is e-commerce. It's more of a tone. It shows the taste and aesthetic of the anchor. So, this is also a product that the small book has a high price for live broadcasting. One of the reasons is that it doesn't have the 9.9-dollar price. It's basically 8, 9, or hundreds, thousands. Then, ads. Ads are platforms that we use to receive official ads. They are for reporting. You can also use soft networks. If you use soft networks, you don't need to use e-commerce. Then, specials. Specials has been on the market for a while. It seems to be back again. This is mainly because the knowledge IP is more practical. Oh, no. Specials. Specials is for booking. Specials is for booking for official booking. But this seems to have been suspended. Because the internal project they did was not good. They invited those people to record and then upload to the small book platform. They divided it into 50% of the total. Then, a lot of people... A lot of bloggers can't make money from this. Basically, it's a two or three-day stay. You can't make money from this. But now, it seems that... There are no more booking appointments. But you can still see what you had before. Then, there are some non-official channels. Non-official channels are mainly for private domain. If you have a product or service, you can complete the conversion in private domain. At this time, I think... You can create a public platform. Including some offline activities, endorsements, and so on. There are also some small notification platforms. Like the red notification, the mass notification. There will be some PRs to advertise. But the quality of the advertisements on this is usually not very high. So, you have to select them carefully. There are some that are relatively shallow. But you can still make money from them. Then, if you talk about the advertising part, a lot of brands or PRs will contact the sponsors through email or private message. So, it's not necessarily through the channel of PugongYin. Next, I will show you some cases of conversion. A case of conversion. For example, this picture. This is a live broadcast. This is the special edition we talked about earlier. It looks like this. You can buy it directly. You can listen to it on the platform. But this one... It seems that it's not in the online invitation. I don't care about it. Then, there is the experience station. The experience station is on the left side of the small book. Click on the three bars on the left. There is the experience station. Then, there will be some... You can go to the platform and put your own products in it. Then, you can apply for it. After applying, you can write your experience note. Then, there is the summer shop. The summer shop is a very important part of the small book store business. And the threshold of the summer shop is not very high. So, basically, if you have a product you want to sell, you can open the summer shop. Of course, it doesn't matter if you don't have a summer shop. You can go on a holiday. If you want to do live streaming or bring your notes, you can go to the store in another store. Then, on the left, there is the live streaming and bring your notes. You can see it. Now, if you want to talk about the overall, the live streaming and bring your notes is still very good. This is also a platform that has a development trend of one or two years. Then, you can see that the whole live streaming, the products that it sells, there are those with a margin of tens of dollars, there are also those with one or two hundred dollars, and there are also those with hundreds or thousands of dollars. This brand represents most of the clothing brands on the summer book. It sells very well. Then, on the right, this is the note bringer. Note bringer is when you send a note, and then the product you want to bring is hung on the bottom. It's linked below. Then, you can buy it directly by clicking on it. So, it actually directly opens a path from content to transformation. Then, this blogger is a normal person. Then, he specifically goes to test-travel some brands. Some high-end dresses. Then, he'll go and try it on for everyone. Is it good? Then, you can also see that the overall sales of this one is still very good. You can see that the price of this course is more than 1700. The postcards are all 1700. In fact, it is more than 1900. He also sold 16 sets. He sold 16 sets. Make it a little bigger for everyone to see. The overall sales of this one has a lot of grass genes. Then, this blogger has a lot of grass benefits. So, you see, you can bring such a product with a pocket of more than 1000. You can also bring it out through a notebook. I think it's still very good. Then, the second part, I'll tell you about the transformation thinking. This is what I really want to share with you. You can beat 90% of people with this transformation thinking. Because a lot of people who want to be a blogger are confused. I just don't want to understand. I just do it. I don't know how to transform it afterwards. I even feel that I'm going to be a fan. I'm going to make my fans grow. I can definitely get an advertisement. Is it like this? I can tell you for sure that it's not. So, the reason why most people can't change their line is actually these few. First of all, he didn't think about how to transform it. He just knew about the growth. Because I receive a lot of advice from bloggers every day. So, many people may get 10,000 or 20,000 followers. He didn't get any ads for a penny. He just didn't make any money for a penny. There are also a lot of people. So, don't think that if you have fans, you can definitely transform it. It's not that stage now. Because there is no shortage of ads at all. Every platform has a lot of ads. So, if you don't think about transforming, you won't be able to do it. Even if you receive ads, you have to think about what brand needs. Why should you get ads? So, even if you receive ads, you have to think about which brands can receive the ads you do. How can I reserve the advertising position so that the brand knows which types of ads I can receive to get me ads? Second, the exposure of the content is poor. You can't reach the target user. It's easy to understand. The data of your content and content is not good. How can you reach your target user? It's even harder to transform. Because you didn't reach the target user at first. So, you can't be seen. Third, the user's accuracy is not accurate. This is actually a problem with many accounts. I share everything. I might take it as a circle of friends. Or, I just take it as a life record. I don't go into detail. So, there are many accounts that I might take to the target user. But the content I share doesn't help me to attract my target user. So, I can't transform it. Then, there is no content strategy. No content strategy. Your content is too far from the transformation. This is usually very selfish. Some are very enthusiastic. But they don't perform well. I've seen some positive energy accounts before. They definitely don't transform well. Because you want to pay attention to the content. They are all fake. Many times, you don't have your core products. It's hard for you to transform. So, I want to share with you an important knowledge about transformation. The number of fans and the number of earnings may not be the same. You must remember this. The number of fans and the number of earnings may not be the same. Because I've seen too many. Although the number of fans is small, it makes a lot of money. But some bloggers have a lot of fans. But they don't transform. Many people think that the number of fans makes a lot of money. But they are so poor that they can't even support themselves. So, many bloggers break their roots. They may not make money. Or, they don't cover the money they make. But they don't make a profit. So, we see many bloggers break their roots. Some accounts don't have many fans. But they are definitely rich. So, the number of fans and the number of earnings may not be the same. I will show you some cases. You can feel the knowledge through these cases. Okay, I will stop here. I will stop here. I will stop here. I will stop here. I will stop here. I will stop here. I will stop here. Okay, let's see why this happens. The number of fans and the number of conversions are not the same. There are two different conversion logics in this. The first one is called active conversion. Active conversion is more suitable for brand founders. Why is it called active conversion? Because the brand founder has his own product and goal. And I can convert my product or service. I can use the self-media platform as my channel. I can use the platform to get traffic. I can convert my personal content. Or I can directly transfer my content to this platform. It's okay. At this point, the top line of my conversion depends on my products and services. My price. So, in fact, my product capability and conversion capability at the back end is what directly determines the existence of the top line of my conversion. So, as an active transformer, you will find that the conversion capability of each industry and each channel is definitely different. Right? So, at this point, many people... In fact, what I'm after is accurate fans. If I start to use active conversion, I'm after accurate fans and accurate traffic. Because if I count one by one, as long as I'm accurate, I can convert. Right? It has nothing to do with my fans. No matter how many fans I have, I can't convert. I'm also a fake viral, right? I'm selling my own products and services directly. So, what I'm after is that the fans should be accurate. The more my account is vertical, the more accurate my fans are. So, when I put my product and service directly into the content, and let others know that I'm providing these products and services, they will come to me. They will come to me, and I can sell my products and services to them. This is what we call active conversion. So, active conversion has a very high top line. Next, there is another conversion logic. Another conversion logic is passive conversion. Active conversion is actually more suitable for most people. Why do I say this? Because for most people, this is the path of being a blogger. Many people may not have their own products at the beginning. They may simply have a hobby or a hobby, and then they share it. Then they share it. At this point, they find that many people like my sharing, so they follow me. At this point, I have gathered a lot of traffic. So, for this brand, I have a traffic value. Because I have gathered a lot of traffic here, I am now in an advertising position. So, at this point, the brand is like asking me to advertise. That means they are buying my advertising position. So, generally speaking, most ordinary people become bloggers and start to share. Even if there is no existing product, they mainly rely on advertising to convert. At this point, I have a self-media platform, which is my traffic platform. I go to this place to get traffic. Then I just need to use my special products to do my content. Then people keep following me. The more traffic, the more traffic value I have. So, in fact, this path of being a blogger, the path of being a blogger, it is not too small. You choose the track, you try to lose the pursuit of the width. Because the more traffic you have, the more fans you have, the stronger your conversion ability will be. If everyone is on the path of being a blogger, that is, they rely on advertising to make a living, then of course, 100,000 fans will make more money than 10,000 fans. This is not a question. Because everyone relies on advertising. Then I am a blogger with 100,000 fans, my price will definitely be higher. The price of a blogger with 10,000 fans will definitely be lower. So... So if in the same logic of conversion, the more fans, the more money you make, but many people will ignore it and say, oh, he has very few fans, he must not make money. So in this, it is possible that others are not relying on the logic of advertising conversion at all. He is taking the initiative to convert. Then he may not be in line with the logic of conversion and the logic of conversion. So for most ordinary people, to do the Internet celebrity, to do the Internet celebrity, to do the traffic support, is inevitable in the early stages, is to attract some traffic. So you will find that they are very good at doing some traffic-based topics. Just some big bags. Because it can't be too small. It just needs a lot of traffic. So in the early stages, they won't do that kind of too deep, too deep, too straight content. But the founders of this brand are different. What I want is a precise fan. Of course, the more straight I am, the more precise my fans are. The more the conversion, the stronger it is. So these are two different logics. If you have a get, give me a 1. If you understand this point, give me a 1. Okay, good. So let's look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of different ways of making money. First, let's talk about passive money making. As we just said, passive money making is mainly based on advertising, right? If you want to make an advertisement, the brand buys your advertising position, right? So you actually need to make a relatively light product. You need to make some photos, some photos or videos that are light. You can help the brand to attract the target users that it wants. That's how it can buy your advertising value, your traffic value, right? So passive money making requires a relatively large fan base, so that you can make more money by advertising. So what are the advantages? If the fan base is large, the advertising income is relatively high. For example, some bloggers can make 100,000 to 200,000 yuan per ad. I may only receive three or five ads a month, so I can live better. But for most people now, it's actually more difficult to really reach that level. And the budget of the advertising side, the budget of this brand, the advertising budget is also continuously reduced. So many bloggers, the head of the ad may not be affected that much. The middle and waist, including the tail, if you want to change the line by advertising, you may have eaten the top and not the bottom. It's particularly unstable. So what are the disadvantages of passive money making? The disadvantage is that the requirement for the people who shoot the videos and bloggers is relatively high. You will find that some videos that are of poor quality are difficult to reach. So you can't really make money. Because the brand must pay attention to the brand's brand, whether the brand is suitable for the blogger, the blogger's personality, the fans' age, the data. The advertising side will also measure a lot of dimensions. So if it's the quality of the average, it may be more difficult to receive ads. So the disadvantage of passive money making is that the income is unstable. If you can't get ads this month, you may have income. If you can't get ads, you don't have income. So if you make money by only getting ads, bloggers are actually more likely to be anxious. Including the data of your recent content directly affects your advertising. If, for example, you are not good at these recent content data, you may not be able to get ads. So this makes money. And the data of the notes you have published recently is directly related to it. So many bloggers will be affected by this. It's easy to be depressed. So from now on, I don't really recommend that everyone rely on passive money making alone to maintain their own business model. Okay? Okay. Let's look at passive money making. Passive money making is selling products or services. If you are active in making money, you need to build trust. Why do people buy your products and services? Because they trust you. For example, the professionalism you show in your industry, the advantages of your products, your values, right? I will... I will choose to buy your products because I trust you. So the core of active money making is that you build this sense of trust. Even if it's 10 fans, you can make money. It's not that much of a relationship with your fans. I may see a certain note of yours, and then I see that you provide a certain service. I may not necessarily pay attention to you, but it doesn't affect my search for your consumption. Do you understand what I mean? So it's not half a dime less than your fans. It's not a big deal. What are the advantages of active money making? It's mainly about connecting and trusting your fans. So what are the advantages of active money making? It's easier to make money. You can make a single profit by selling a single product. It's like, you can make a profit by doing this and that. As long as it's accurate, and there's no problem with my products and services, I can make a profit by doing this and that. So it's easier to make money. It's easier to make money. It's easier to make money. And it's not that demanding for the amount of fans. The income is more stable, and you can control it. What are the disadvantages? The disadvantage is that you're lazy. Why do I say that? Because when you're in an advertisement, even if you've made less money recently, the data you've accumulated before is better. Maybe there's an advertiser who wants to make money from you. But if you're actively making money, you can't see it from your accurate users. How can they find you to make money? So, actively making money means that you need to keep saving. So you need to overcome the laziness of the human nature. Including those who do live broadcasts. They have to broadcast every day. They can't broadcast once a month for three days, or two days, or three days. You probably haven't seen any live broadcasts that broadcast once a month. They can only broadcast once every three or five months. Right? Because it's an initiative-based mode. At the same time, because of this positive feedback of being active, you can make money every day, or you can make tens of millions or millions of dollars from one live broadcast. You don't even want to stop. So, being active in making money is a challenge. It's a challenge. It's a challenge. Here are a few examples. An example of being active in making money and passive in making money. The first one is a blogger. He has more than 300,000 followers. He usually receives more advertisements. The price of an advertisement is about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. It should be about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. This blogger used to be a English blogger. Apart from receiving advertisements, what else does he have? So, you see, he's actually an active-based mode, active in making money and passive in making money. He has both. His passive making money is by receiving advertisements. At the same time, he also has active making money. Because he's an English blogger, he's a voice-over. He's a voice-over. So, he also teaches students how to become a partner. He has his own offline studio. At the same time, he also takes over some of the other partners' work. So, he's actually a typical active-based mode and passive in making money. The second example is a typical active-based mode. You can see that he mainly sells his class. He sells his class on the American circle. He's a micro-business. And the third example is... This is a female voice-over blogger. But when he was in the 50,000 or 60,000-script level, because I talked to him before, when he was in the 50,000 or 60,000-script level, he didn't receive any advertisements. He didn't receive any advertisements. But he... You can see that he also left his public account and... WeChat. Of course, you can't keep it now. You can keep your public account, but you can't keep your WeChat. He intentionally sent his users to private domain. He sent a lot of users to private domain. At that time, he added up to... He added up to more than 20 groups. One group was about 400 or 500 people. Then he sold some of his books. Then he sold some... Some products that were in the female voice category. So, it's kind of like a female voice e-commerce model. So, here's the question. You can think about it. Who made more money in these three cases? You can give me your answer. Who do you think made more money? One, two, three. From left to right. One, two, three. Okay? One, two, three. From the two top groups, one of them is a very bright woman. His role in the world of social media market. He is able to create and promote content for the rest. Because he has... You know... You know, he wanted to acquire a lot of money. Yeah. But he was making a good Jeff Bezos official. And then he worked at the that house... Okay. That house, the one that you can... What a nice NEX marketplace. 因为主动变现它其实是没有上限的啊 那那其实相对来说的话哈 如果说一这个博主他只是接广告的话 他不一定有二三赚的多啊 就是他如果只接广告 他不一定有二三赚的多 你不要看这个二这个 这个他的数据不怎么好 但是你想想他一份课卖1588啊 对吧 他他的上限啊 他能卖多少对吧 而且他可能还不只是这个要 所以知识啊 他是走了知识IP的路子 那么这个知识IP的这个上限也是挺高的啊 那再说第三个啊 就是第三个就是属于他就是没有接广告 所以他的用户就特别信任他啊 就是觉得觉得他那个没有没有去接广告啊 没有没有怎么怎么样啊 反而他带货就也做得挺好的啊 就卖汇本啊 卖那些啊 也做挺好的啊 所以这个里面没有绝对的说谁挣挣的多 因为他们都是主动变现为主啊 主动变现为主啊 可能相对来说在一段时间之内 一这个博主他是最稳定的啊 为什么因为他是主动变现加被动变现啊 就是他既有主动变现的方式 也有被动变现的方式 所以相对来说他会活得更轻松一些啊 就是哪怕我说他有主动变现的方式 但是我今天这个不发内容不营业了 我还有广告收入嘛 对吧 但是一这个博主他其实主要的收入就是广告收入啊 在这个平台上他主要是广告收入啊 所以通过这个案例大家也会知道说啊 就是当我们的思路开始转向主动赚钱的时候 我们的天花板就会变得更高 对不对 当我们开始主动赚钱的时候 我们的天花板就会变得更高啊 大家可以把这句话记下来啊 所以思维上转变为主动赚钱 你就超过了至少90%的人啊 因为大部分的人去做啊 其实都是没有想明白的 我就要不就是想啊 我就想着等着接广告变现 实际上根本就没有广告早盘了 那有些人觉得一看他粉丝那么少 他肯定也赚不到钱 实际上人家背地里面正在闷声发大态 就以支持博主为例哈 像大家知不知道那个 想说情感赛道的那个博主 曲曲大女人啊 人家支持IP 他走的就是支持IP的路子 人家一年可以挣一个亿 所以所以 搭上了我的这个课 一定不要 再去有这种 这种什么呢 不成熟的一些偏见啊 就是你一定要有正确的这个变现思维啊 就是这个才是真的懂行的人哈 就是我们也会去说 就有些人他就不懂行啊 只会去看粉丝数啊 其实就是外行你知道吧 内行都不会这么去看 所以希望大家也能够去找到 主动赚钱的方式啊 比如说现在现在 对于小物数平台来说 很多博主都开始转看去做直播带货啊 其实直播带货就是主动赚钱的一种方式啊 因为他在卖产品对吧 好那我们来看一下 关于流量博主和IP的生命周期啊 刚给大家说了哈 流量博主走的是被动变现对吧 IP IP走的是主动变现啊 基本上是这样去换的啊 这个是有点划分的哈 所以大家也可以通过刚刚讲的内容 知道说流量博主和IP 他的这个生命周期是不是不太一样啊 因为对于大部分博主而言 他的生命周期只有两到三年啊 就是我们会看到很多博主啊 就是慢慢的就烧身立即了对吧 因为平台永远需要更好的内容啊 就是我们会看到很多博主啊 就是用户他永远需要更新的内容啊 就是他不会说 嗯一直只粉你一个人 因为平台源源不断的有新人在产生啊 所以你会发现那些真正跨越了这个 生命周期的他其实已经脱离了流量博主了 他可能自己要么就变成资本了对吧 要么就是成为一个IP了啊 比如说之前啊 我做这个微博做的比较好的对吧啊 后面我就带着粉丝来做这个博主了啊 然后又到了抖音对吧 有有有这样子的这个博主啊 非常少啊 因为大部分的博主没有办法去突破这个困境 他的生命周期基本上就只有两到三年啊 就是我两到三年把把钱赚了啊 那那之后我我就接受自己慢慢的啊 我就不红了对吧 没有广告来找我了啊 所以 因为因为对不对于大部分博主啊 博主来说就是你走流量博主的这个路子啊 就是他是会越来越激烈的啊 比如说我刚开始做的时候还有红利 那随着这个入住的博主越来越多 竞争就越来越激烈 但是品牌方的投放啊 这个他其实不太是会是一个就是 特别大的那种幅度的变动啊 就是我一个品牌每年投多少广告 我基本上是相对比较稳定的对吧 相对比较稳定 他幅度不会比较稳定啊 因为特别大啊 我只有这么多预算我投给谁对吧啊 所以其实慢慢的就会进入到 声多走少的这样子的一个局面啊 同时因为流量在平台的手中啊 你的替代性是非常的强的哈 就是很容易就被替代了啊 同时也是因为收入不稳定带来的这个焦虑感 所以大部分的博主啊 其实是没有办法支撑到超过三年的啊 那这个时候怎么去破局呢啊 大家可以看IP是什么 IP它是不是有长久的生命力 比如说这个龙远号啊 比如说于敏红对吧 龙远号你看他换了那么多行业 他永远都可以从头再来 为什么就是因为他的IP 大家信任的是他这个人啊 包括这个于敏红对吧 之前做这个英语 包括于敏红后面去开始做英语对吧 英语教育啊 就是做这种教育啊 做教育赛道没有做了以后 开始去做东方增选啊 做做龙产品对吧 他也一样做的风生水平啊 其实这个就是一个IP的一个能量啊 就是IP它和博主最大的区别 就是IP是可以跨越时间和周期的啊 就是因为它跟用户的这种黏性和链接啊 不会因为他做的事情变动而变动啊 因为大家始终追随的都是他这个人啊 所以博主其实就包括之前也给大家分享过啊 就博主的这个人啊 博主他其实需要突破一个一个的瓶颈对吧 那博主其实最好的就是慢慢的从IP去进阶对吧 那如果是做不到的话 那至少要让自己的生命周期拉长的话 要做到第一个跨平台啊 就是要多平台运营去分担风险啊 我这个平台不行了 还有另外一个平台对吧 我永远都要去追随新的平台啊 去找到新的一些流量挖地 找到一些新的机会啊 那第二个是什么 第二个是跨界 所以你会看到有一些博主 他可能一开始分享的是穿搭或者美妆啊 那他后面他可能又去分享一些家居啊什么的 你也不会觉得突兀对吧 因为你相信他是有审美的啊 就是他以他的审美 那只要做的是跟美相关的啊 可能都可以对吧 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 就是我不断的去探索这个新的领域啊比如说我就去啊慢慢的去做一些这个嗯 从 from bloggers to capitalization. This is actually a path for most bloggers. So we can see the development of our personal brand from this. You can't get a long-term development by fighting alone. You will definitely advance from your personal brand to your corporate brand. How do you understand this? Why do we want to be a personal brand? Some people might be creating their own IPs. Why? Because it's very difficult to push your corporate brand. You can't get a lot of money out of it. So I might take my personal brand to support my corporate brand. Because I use my personality to attract fans, and I spread my brand's ideas and culture. I can strengthen trust between users. This can help my corporate brand to recover. It can also provide a backup for my products. In this case, I can greatly reduce the cost of marketing and promotion. For example, for Luo Yonghao, Yu Minhong and I, when they come out to do something, do they need to advertise a lot? No, they don't. You just need to know that this is made by Luo Yonghao, and this is made by Yu Minhong. I feel very confident. I think I can pay for it. So it's actually completely by making backups for your own brand. After a certain stage, it will expand to become an enterprise brand. What an enterprise brand needs is stability and repeatability, right? I might turn this past content system into a content marketing system that can bring traffic to long-term companies. I might have to form a team, and create a content-based traffic trading system to reach customers with low-cost content. At this point, you will find that for the entire enterprise, it's still quite difficult to do this. This is called a competitive obstacle. Because anyone who wants to become an enterprise brand will either make a lot of money, make it to the same level as you, or they will have to go from a personal brand to an enterprise brand and then take another step. Of course, in this context, it doesn't matter if we are still in the stage of a personal brand. We will slowly develop. When we start to avoid the personal brand, we will slowly move towards an enterprise brand. I am also a personal brand and an enterprise brand. So, no matter what stage we are in, I believe I can provide you with some help. Let's take a look at the advertising transformation. There are some details about the advertising transformation. How to get ads, and how to do it by using advertising transformation. First, let's take a look at this. This is a data dimension of a brand's choice. So, from this, you can see that not all accounts can receive ads. Because the brand also has its own assessment system. The assessment system of the brand is mainly assessed by data. So, basically, it will be divided into some corresponding indicators. The core is that the brand sees that the users that your fans and my brand want to be confirmed with are consistent. For example, I want to be a brand that is going to be in the young women's category. I won't go and find a brand that all its fans are male and advertise like this, right? It's easy for everyone to understand. So, in this, you can mainly look at some basic indicators. For example, your fan base, your account number, your account number, your account level. I will read them one by one for you. Including the fan base and the number of likes. This is the like and dislike that I told you before. You flip the data over. It's this. It's mainly to evaluate your fan age. For example, you posted a lot of content and only gained a few fans. As I said before, your account is not very good. Your fan base rate is relatively low. Your fans' age will be very low. So, the brand must want to find a fan with a relatively strong age. If the fan age is relatively strong, it means that the IP has a relatively strong attribute. Then there are some growth indicators. Growth indicators are... What does it mean? I will explain it to you. For example, your growth is relatively fast recently. Your growth is relatively slow. When I find you to post ads, for example, you have 30,000 fans. Then I will pay you the advertising fee according to the 30,000 yuan advertisement fee. At this time, you may have a relatively poor growth. Because the ads are not possible to be posted today or tomorrow. There is still a period. I will post ads after two weeks or after a month. When I post ads, you have 60,000 fans. Then as a brand, do I earn money? I spent 30,000 yuan on advertising. I actually received an advertisement fee of 60,000 yuan. This is the flow. So, the brand must choose these. Now, I am in the commercial. I am in the high-speed growth account. So, in fact, the blogging of the central and central government is still very popular. Especially when you just started. Recently, we have just talked about the growth period of this account. There is not too much lack of ads. Then there are the burst indicators, including the trend indicator. This is just a demonstration for you. This is the range that the brand may consider when choosing a number. Then we think in reverse. If we want to use ads, we have to pay attention to our data, we have to pay attention to our growth, we have to pay attention to our exposure, we have to pay attention to the tone of our IP. This is what we have to think in reverse. Then this is the step-by-step. Usually, it is left in the mailbox. Then the brand will ask for your volume and price. Then you can go and understand the product and give it a price. The price is mainly based on whether it is a single product or a collection, whether it is a copy or not, whether it is a picture or a video. You can make a price for different forms. Then you can determine some cooperation details. Then you can make a price for the number of changes. This is something that newbies need to pay attention to. Because many newbies may not understand. Then many brands are more gray-haired. They will keep changing. If you want to change it ten or eight times, the time you spend on it is very expensive. So it's best to make a good appointment. How do you set the advertising price? How do you set the advertising price? The average advertising price is the amount of fans. It's one tenth of the total. Usually, it's one tenth of the total. But the battlefield ratio and the six-way trend are the indicators I just showed you. The size of the account, the contact with your fans, the data of the interaction, all of these directly affect your price. So one tenth is an average of a large number of brands. It's not absolute. And some channels will have a higher price. For example, the price of the ad blogger is usually higher than that of other channels. Let's take a look at the categories of advertising notes. The first category is the type of survey. The second is the type of DIY strategy. The third is the type of survey. The fourth is the type of good sharing. The fifth is the type of teaching sharing. What are the differences between these categories? You know about the type of survey, right? It's when you actually use a product and compare its properties and effects. For example, I went to test the sunscreen, right? I tested more than 20 products. I applied it to my body, right? I applied it under the sun. After I finished the sunscreen, I checked the sunscreen's effect. The content of the survey has reached its maximum. The survey has reached its maximum. It's extremely comprehensive. The survey is comprehensive. It's a survey. You may have tested a few. But the threshold is relatively high. Many people find it difficult to make a highlight when they are doing a survey. You have to test so many products. The cycle is also very long. The second category is the type of DIY strategy. The type of DIY strategy is to combine your products with other products to solve a certain pain. For example, sunscreen, sunscreen, sunblock, and these products. The third category is the type of DIY strategy. The type of DIY strategy is to put a product into a certain scene. The product's selling point is shown in the scene. It will arouse the user's psychological needs and affect the user's buying decision. We can see in many blogs what kind of scene it will show you. What kind of thing it uses. For example, I'm a couple blogger. I talk about how to coordinate the time between couples. How to coordinate the time between couples. How to do housework. How to put in some sweepers and machines. Right? How to avoid the grass and grass that the couple uses to do housework. It is actually a kind of grass. You will feel that it's too convenient to have this sweeper. You often quarrel with your partner for housework. You will want to have a product like this. Right? Then there is the type of good things to share. Generally, it's to coordinate. To highlight where the product is good and why it is good. Usually, it is to buy it back for yourself. So, in the previous book, there was an empty bottle. When I got up, I used up a lot of bottle of essence. It's similar to this. Then the fifth type is the type of teaching and sharing. Teaching and sharing is to solve problems. It is to teach users how to use products correctly or better. It is more focused on the steps, processes and methods. Let's look at some cases. The one on the left, the one with the sun protection from the top to the bottom, is a DIY strategy. It talks about sunscreens, sunscreens, sunscreens, sunscreens, and the whole thing. It is a set of sunscreens. Right? What about the second one? The second one is the 24-piece sunscreens. Three people tested it. It tested a total of 24 sunscreens. So, this is a typical review and analysis type. Then the third one is the one on the right. It is the type of teaching and sharing. It teaches you how to use the generator. It tells you how to use it. What are the steps? What are the steps? What are the steps? What are the steps? Then, let's look at this one. This one on the left is a good thing to share. It is a kind of bag. It is telling you what it has packed in its bag when it goes to work. It is to prove that these things are what you use often. It is a good thing that you use. So, this is a typical good thing to share. Then, this one. This one is a type of plant. This is a couple vlog. It is actually the type of wine it is pushing. It is the type of wine it is pushing. It is a couple vlog. So, this is a typical type of plant. Let's take a look at the writing direction of the plant notes. There are usually two types of plant notes. The first type is single. The second type is collective. Single is actually based on the way of engineering. The main thing is that there are some dry goods. There are some teaching content. It is a soft-input product. So, basically, the soft-input of small books, those that are not in the bag, are basically made into the form of seed notes. The single type is usually... a type of plant. It is a type of plant. It is a type of plant. It is told in a wide and valid Anyway, ourě has a projeto that is very similar to the general regulation. We want to make it more authentic and觀 Lincoln, and also has the right approach to the general regulations and principles. It means that the character, as the director, operatesthe medium and theblot, which are in harmony with all the textualchio s credit, So, this is highly realistic. What happens is that the Girong weight is volume, because there are rushing water, This doesn't mean that the weight does not垂 with等ak to stepped land and islands. It is just the've never changed. So,we just care. The horizontal one is for the test, and the vertical one is for sharing. The horizontal one is like the sunblock, which is called the horizontal test. The vertical one is based on a series of actions that are done based on a certain target. The spring and summer sunblock that I mentioned earlier is more of a vertical one. So the elements of the vertical chart are the values that must be included in the vertical chart. The first one is the scene, the second one is the selling point, and the third one is the audience. In the digital chart, the more powerful model is the point of pain, the product texture, the ingredient support, the audience and the scene that is suitable. In fact, this model can be applied to all industries. For example, I'm a travel guide, right? Then I might also have the point of pain in front of me. For example, I'm with my best friend, my boyfriend, I'm traveling with my family, right? In this, I'm targeting the audience and the audience. Then I'm talking about my destination, what are the points of the trip, right? How to arrange the schedule, and so on. In fact, if you extend this and apply it, it's the same. You turn the product texture into the specific points of the location, or something like that, and then how to experience it. Then the ingredient support, you make it into the product texture. Then you make it into the product texture. Then you make it into the product texture. You turn it into the strategy of my days of formation, right? In fact, it can be completely applied. Then I'll give you a case. Like this case, it's not a good seeding note. Why? You can take a look at its description of the case. What's the 40-second preheating, how to increase the amount, what's the design of the daily, what's the guesswork, these simple descriptions. He didn't say anything. It's just a hard look. It's not a real experience sharing. If you've used your real experience, it shouldn't be like this. So this is not a good seeding note. Let me show you two more cases. Like this one, it's a travel blogger. The content of this travel blogger, just came back from the West China Sea, played for six days, and spent 0.3 million on the strategy. Then you can see what he said. Qinghai is so beautiful, but it's a few days away. It's a long way to go. I suggest you to choose a backpack or a group tour. It's more convenient than the free trip. It saves money and effort. It's really convenient. Actually, what I just told you about the travel blogger, he gave his personality as a travel blogger. But in fact, it's not. He's actually a group tourer who goes to his place to make a group. He takes people to travel. It's a way of transportation. But he didn't share it directly like this. He's standing at a personal level, which is equivalent to the personal experience of a simulator user. He made a variety of notes. So you'll see. Everyone asks what group he's in. What group is he in? In fact, this group is his own group. Can you understand? This group is his own group. But what he simulated was, he's not a third party. I'm recommending you a group I've reported. It's a good experience. You should go. But at this point, you'll find that the user trusts him very much. Because he thinks he's experienced it. Then I'll show you another case. The same case. This is an enterprise account. You can see the name of it. You can see it. Mo Mo Mo International Travel. Right? He actually wanted to imitate this kind of genuine sharing. He just came back from Qinghai. He's going to play with his best friend. He also wanted to simulate this kind of genuine sharing. But the content he wrote is very obvious. It's very obvious. It's not like genuine sharing. You can take a look. You see, he's actually talking about going out with his boyfriend. But he didn't say anything about playing with his boyfriend at all. Then you play with your boyfriend. You must have, for example, This boyfriend takes pictures for you. Something like this. Right? Right? You can see that he's eating something good with his boyfriend. Something like that. But it doesn't really show up in this. It doesn't show up at all. Some things about him and his boyfriend. It's not the kind of real life. You can think about it. If it's real in real life. You and your boyfriend are sharing. Go to travel. Will you share like this? Then you can also take a look at the last point. Sisters who don't want to do it on their own. You can follow the local. Local group. You can check two to six people. No shopping. No fee. Save time. More routes. Form a number. You can text or message anytime. Reply to everyone as soon as possible. You can see that this is an institution account. You can also see that the data gap is still quite big. You can see the gap in the intuition. So he's actually imitating this. This is a real user sharing. This kind of heavy-duty notes. But he didn't imitate the essence. It's still like that. This kind of post like hard light. So you look at his comments area. Everyone knows he's selling this product. So I'm asking him how much this is. Racial price. In fact, you can also see from the comments area. What is the user's feeling? But you look at the first case. People are asking. Not asking him how much. Just ask him what group you're holding. What group are you holding? He said I'm low on you. In fact, it's his own group. But his effect. Including his overall feeling is different. Can you understand this point? Can you understand this case? Give me a one. Okay. So we need to know that we're in this heavy-duty notes. In the heavy-duty notes, we need to describe the product selling point. How should we describe it? It's absolutely not to list out these selling points. First of all, it's to refuse to sell products with a real use. It's best to have an effective evaluation and recommendation. So you'll see. In the first two articles, it's very obvious. Like this Yang Yang Love Travel. It has this kind of real experience and feelings. But this doesn't. Right? This is very official description. No experience and feelings with boyfriend. What's the second one? The first person's perspective. I must have experienced the product and reflected the real information. You see, there's nothing in this. He didn't say what's the relationship between me and my boyfriend. What's the relationship between me and my boyfriend? No, right? He lacks this first person's perspective. The third one is to understand the writing. Light-headed, but writing the highlight. Like the hard light just now. It's the direct I think it's that. Light-headed, but writing the highlight. And then he didn't speak it out. Then it's some detailed descriptions of the same feeling. For example, the sense of movement. Language needs to be lively. For example, if he is to describe it himself, he will say, I finished it in three minutes. I finished it in two minutes. It should be this description. It's not that kind of official description, right? So, so I want to rely on advertising. There are still a lot of skills. Because the notes of the advertisement still need your quantity. That is, your data is better. Then you have to learn how to write this kind of advertisement note. Some people see the data relatively well. Then I. I shared some methods for you today. And how to write the core of this kind of heavy-duty notes. Instead of these hard lights. Instead of making hard lights. I also shared some cases for you. I believe you can feel it through these cases. Okay, that's it for today's class. After this class, you can continue to write your own graduation design. Graduation design is in the small book. Officially published a book. It's a book that starts with self-identification and personality. And then your content can be personality stories, professional depth of study content, or some points of view content. All of them. Okay, so you can continue to do your own graduation design. That's it for today's class. See you next time. Bye. See if you have any questions. Leave a comment for two minutes. If there's no question, that's it for today. If you have any questions, just turn on the microphone. I'll answer them. I have a question. I'm doing sports test now. I think the transmission is limited. Maybe the live stream will be better. I want to do another small account. You've worn our underwear, right? This is our underwear product. What do you think of this? It's like the kind of active transmission you just said. As long as you have IP, you can bring your goods. I'm a wearer, I don't have to bring only my underwear. I can bring anything. So the core is, as long as you have IP, you can bring anything you want. I used to bring my goods on live stream. I brought my goods while I was doing sports. I didn't have to worry about the result.",

    "data": " So people talk when writing fiction about character, they talk about dialogue, they talk about them as if they're two different things. And they are two different things, but they're two different things that actually amount to the same thing. And they're like the two legs that a character needs in order to walk. So in the next class, we're going to talk about character and dialogue and what they are and how incredibly tightly interwoven they can be. When I started out, the most terrifying thing for me was the idea of character creation. And... And who were characters? I didn't really get characters. I didn't understand what characters were. And it took a while for me to learn really how to write good characters. Characters who were three-dimensional, characters who felt real. Characters who felt real to me. A lot of the key to it, people say, well, do you do those sort of books and things before you start? Do you list off lots of things about your characters? And I say no. Mostly what I do is try and figure out what they sound like. How they talk. Sometimes what they look like, but mostly how they talk. Because dialogue is character. The way that somebody talks, what they say, how they say it is character. And dialogue has to... Show character. It also has to show plot. And maybe it can be funny along the way. And good dialogue is doing all three of those things at the same time. It's making you smile or making you see things you've never seen before. It's moving the story along. And more than anything, it's telling you things about the people who are saying it. And who they're saying it to. And so for me, the key to writing good dialogue, which was the key to character, were the years that I spent as a journalist doing interviews. I would meet somebody that I wanted to talk to. Writers, creators. I'd have my little tape recorder. I would talk to them. For two or three hours. I would transcribe the tape. And then having transcribed the tape, which would give me 10,000 words of transcription, my task would be to turn that into a 2,000 to 3,000 word interview. So I learned a lot at that point about economy. How do you make somebody sound like themselves without ever necessarily using the exact words, the words that they used? Because now you're compressing. And people don't talk like themselves. People don't use semicolons. People don't speak grammatically. People, instead they start sentences. They leave words dangling. A few seconds ago I said people, and then I hesitated. And then I changed course. Because that's how people talk. And you can't do that. Or you can't do exactly that in writing. But you can figure out where the rhythms are. You can figure out how to make somebody sound like the person who was talking to you. And you learn compression. You learn more than anything else, economy. And it was that economy that actually I think, looking back on it, that was the most useful thing for going out there and writing fiction. Because I learned how, to compress. And I'd learned how to show character, show who somebody was by what they said. The process of writing good dialogue is a listening process. It's the process of you write the line before and then you listen. And find out what comes back at you. What does the person say? Sometimes for me, I need to know what a person that I'm writing about looks like. When I was writing Sandman, I decided that the title character, the Sandman, who's also known as Dream, would be part of a family called the Endless. And very rapidly, I figured out for myself who the first six of the Endless were. And then there was a young one, and I knew there were seven of them. And I wasn't quite sure about that one. And then I thought delirium. Delirium seems right. And I saw a photograph of a girl, at a nightclub, wearing ripped fishnets sort of all over herself, and just looking very, very sweet, but kind of out of it. I thought, okay, her, that kind of look. There's something very fragile there, and very young. And that was where I began. But I thought that when she came on, in contrast to the slightly out of it look, she was going to be angry. She was gonna be in control. She was going to be, there was gonna be rage. And I tried writing that, and it felt wrong. And I wrote about a page of this dialogue, and it felt forced. It didn't really feel like the character I had in mind. So I thought, oh, well, I'll write about that. And I thought, okay, let's listen to that character. Let's see what we get. And I thought, actually, let's go for something much more gentle and bemused, and speaking in sentences in the same way that a small child can speak in sentences, that is slightly off from whatever you're expecting. And suddenly, the character came to life, and she would say the strangest things. And it was like finding that part of your mind that is gloriously perfectly unhinged. And every now and again she would just say things, like, you know, have you ever spent days and days making up flavors of ice cream that nobody's ever eaten? Chicken and cheese. chicken and telephone ice cream and green mouse ice cream. I didn't like that either. And you're going, oh, I didn't even know that could come out of my head. But once you have a character who can say that kind of thing, then you also have a character who is allowed to say incredibly wise things as well. And so I could sneak huge and important things into Delirium's mouth and know that they could be taken hugely seriously, along with just the weird, lovely, odd, funny little comments she'd make. You know, somebody talks about losing time and she says, I lost some time once. It's always in the last place you look for it. So you have to train yourself as a writer to listen. Characters, if you are writing them, become part of you and become separate from you at the same time. You have to know your characters well enough to know, would they do this? And sometimes they won't. And at that point, mostly I'll trust them. I have known writers who are like, well, you know, they have no choice. If I have written my outline and I have the character going from here to here and they don't want to, well, they do. I tend to listen to my characters. It's like a kind of controlled insanity. Because on the one hand, I am perfectly aware that I'm creating the characters. I made them up. They start with me. Everything they say came out of my head. And on the other hand, the moment that they are alive, the moment that they are doing things, the moment that they are real, I am imbuing them with life. I'm imbuing them with my belief. I care about them. I'm interested in them. And it's almost as if I'm watching them and listening to them. And the problem then comes, when they stop, when they don't say anything, when they don't move. And instead of writing down what they're doing, you have to figure it out. You have to figure out where you went wrong. You have to figure out why the character isn't saying anything. And that, it's always a slightly strange process because there is something genuinely mad about it. Um, if you are writing good characters, believable characters, glorious, larger than life characters, um, they do take on a sort of a life. You know, Terry Pratchett and I used to joke that we talk about, you know, going to meet our maker. And if we kill characters in our fiction, maybe one day, there'd be a knock at the door and we'd open the door. And there would be some of our characters looking up at us, sadly saying, why did I have to suffer and die? And you want to say, well, for the entertainment and enlightenment of other people. And they look up at us and go, is that enough? And you go, it has to be enough. If I'm doing my job as a writer, if I'm giving it everything I've got, my characters are going to be believable because I believe in them. And I believe them. They are going to be separate from me and they're going to be part of me. And some of that is simply having come up with a character, knowing what kind of person that character is going to be at the point in time, where you start writing them. You are going into yourself and you have to not be afraid of yourself. You have to be willing if you're writing a murderer, if you're writing a bad person to go and find that part of you that is the bad person, that is the murderer that would take pleasure in this thing and go, okay, what would you say? What would you do? Who are you? By the same token, you go and find the part of you that is female. You go and find the part of you that is old. You go and find that part. Um, and then you don't think of it as the part of you that's female, the part of you that's old, the part of you that's bad. You think of it as that person. And you trust them. You listen to them. Wow. While you're writing a character named Caroline, you are always, if you are me anyway, asking yourself, well, what would I do? What would I have done? What would I have done if instead of being me in my childhood, I was seven, eight, maybe nine years old, and this was happening to me now? What would I do? And that question, finding that part of yourself that is an eight or nine-year-old girl and feels right is important. It's vital. On the one hand, if you are an adult writer, you know. A lot of people. You have encountered a lot of people in your lifetime. You encountered them at school. You've encountered them at home. You've encountered them in the streets. You have met good people. You have met bad people. You have met bullies. You have met angels. You have met complex and interesting people. You can. And those people, filtered down, flavored differently, are going to start showing up in your fiction. But you're also going to need to write about people you don't know. You're going to need to write about people from cultures you don't know. You're going to write about people with professions you do not understand. You may need to write about types of people who you do not know. And for them, my advice to anybody starting out is just go find them. Go talk to them. Talk to people. Talk to people with different sexual orientations to yours if you're going to be writing them. Talk to people from different cultures. Go in. Do your research. Do it with respect. Know that there are things to be known. So, I think if you are a starting out writer, probably even if you're an experienced writer, I have two pieces of advice for you. If you want to channel a character, a time period, anything, one of which is, and they're kind of opposite and contradictory and they're both true. One of which is trust yourself. Do it. You do it by doing it. Just do it. And the other is do your research. But I've known too many writers. Starting out who would get trapped in a vortex of research. And you can't. You have to do enough research. It's like you're a smash and grab robber. You are going to put that brick through the window. Then you're going to reach in and grab everything that you need and run away and use it. Because honestly, you don't want to spend. You want to spend 10 years researching manners and mores in British public schools of the 1870s in order to get your story perfect. There may be some stories that you have spent your life unconsciously researching. You know what a heartbreak is. You know what it's like to work in a bank. You know what it's like. To have to walk a long way in the rain. Whatever it is, the thing that you're writing is you're going, okay, well, I have that. I have that already. That's there. And if you don't know what it's like to walk for 10 days in the rain, you might know what it's like to walk for a few hours in the rain. And you can extrapolate. You go, okay, well, it's going to be like that only worse. And what's it going to be like on day three? And now you have to sleep in wet clothes. And okay, and everybody and everything is going to hurt. And now you're getting sick. And sore. And now you're getting the athlete's foot in the trench. Oh, this is. But imagination plays a huge amount. Putting yourself in the place of somebody. But then there will be places and times where you go, I don't know this. And I need to find out. Go and learn. Because that's what will make your fiction good. And that's what will also make your fiction feel honest and true. Characters in a book, there are lots of them. And one of the things I learned, I may have learned it from Dickens. Or I may have learned it from Jackson. Or I may have learned it from Jack Kirby. But whoever I learned it from, possibly even from A.A. Milne. When you have a lot of characters wandering around, you need to help your reader. You need to just give your reader a hand. And one of the ways that I've always liked to do that is what I call funny hats. And by funny hats, I don't. I don't actually literally mean you have a character wear a funny hat. What I do mean is you give your character something that makes that character different from every other character in the book. And it's sort of, it's something that reading the work of young writers, they tend to hesitate to do. And the trouble with that is you can't. You can read a short story, occasionally even read a novel, with a number of people who are indistinguishable from each other except for their names. Which means you have to remember their names. You have to remember who they are. And when they show up, you have to thumb back and go, okay, hang on. Is this Simon? Or is this Jack? Or is, oh no, hang on. This is the other. This is the one, the other one who they met before. This is Peter. And what's lovely is just, and you do this as an author out of kindness for your reader, is give them funny hats. Give them that point, you know, Simon wears the bright red bowler hat. And Peter wears the top hat. And, and of course, all of these hats are metaphorical. You just make sure that when somebody comes on. They don't look like anyone else. They don't sound like anybody else. You can do it in realistic fiction. You can do it in children's fiction. You can do it in, you can do it in fiction aimed at the lowest common denominator. You can do it at fiction that is elegant and beautiful. But either way, you just write characters who are different from each other. They look different from each other. They feel different. They don't sound from each other. There is something about them that means that the reader is being, you're holding the reader's hand a little bit. And you're just making sure that they're never confused. So in a book like Neverwhere, we begin with Mr. Krupp and Mr. Vandermaar. And you immediately realize how different they are. Mr. Krupp had hired Ross at the last floating market, which had been held in Westminster Abbey. Think of him, he told Mr. Vandermaar, as a canary. Sings, asked Mr. Vandermaar. I doubt it. I sincerely and utterly doubt it. Mr. Krupp ran a hand through his lank orange hair. No, my fine friend, I was thinking metaphorically. More along the lines of the birds. They take down minds. Mr. Vandermaar nodded, comprehension dawning slowly. Yes, a canary. Mr. Ross had no other resemblance to a canary. There are four simple ways for the observant to tell Mr. Krupp and Mr. Vandermaar apart. First, Mr. Vandermaar is two and a half heads taller than Mr. Krupp. Second, Mr. Krupp has eyes of a faded china blue, while Mr. Vandermaar's eyes are brown. Third, while Mr. Vandermaar. Vandermaar fashioned the rings he wears on his right hand. Out of the skulls of four ravens, Mr. Krupp has no obvious jewelry. Fourth, Mr. Krupp likes words, while Mr. Vandermaar is always hungry. Also, they look nothing at all alike. And so we immediately have a couple of killers. They are very, very dangerous. And they do not... talk in any way alike. They do not look alike. One of them is monosyllabic. The other is multisyllabic. Enjoys words. Is going to have... a relationship with things where the only thing we ever see him eat is a piece of very fine Tang Dynasty china. Whereas Mr. Vandermaar... is always hungry, as we have learned. And just eats things as he goes. Frogs and rats and bits of dead puppy and anything that he happens to find along the way. And they are the assassiniest assassins I could come up with. Some of the other characters in Neverwhere also are funny hat characters. The Marquis de Caravasse, who deals in favors. The Marquis de Caravasse, who deals in favors. Wears a huge and glorious coat. And is always wearing the coat. Until he is murdered and the coat gets stolen and things in the plot get very difficult for him. Old Bailey lives on the top of roofs. And up on the rooftops, he's dressed in a cape of feathers. He's described as looking like what Robinson Crusoe... in the popular imagination would have looked like... if he were cast away on the rooftops of London... with nothing but birds to create his world out of. So you take these characters and... secure in the knowledge that none of them could be confused for any of the others. None of them talk the same. And when they turn up... they... you know who they are. The reason is... the reader does not have to work at that thing.",

And we're going to teach some shiz and look great whilst we're at it. Yep. Over here, Tan. Over here. I've been in the fashion and styling business for 20 years. Most people know me from Queer Eye, but I have helped literally thousands of people find their personal style and find a look that makes them feel like the very best version of themselves. This class is different from anything I've ever done before. I've never had an opportunity to really comprehensively break down what style is and how the principles work. I've never been able to communicate how to really think the way I think when I'm shopping, when I'm styling myself, when I'm styling somebody else. That's what you will get here. During this class, I will give you the tools you need to truly change your life. That is a bold statement, I know, but it's something that I do every day. It doesn't matter your age, your size, your race, your gender identity. Everyone has great style in them. They just need to find it. And that's what I hope to teach you here today. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. The most pivotal moment in my life that led me to this point right now, where I'm able to teach a class on styling. What happened when I was seven, I went to my granddad's factory. He made denim, and for the first time, I understood where clothes came from, how they were created, and how they could make me feel. It was the first time I had a huge selection of clothing to try on. And with every piece I tried on, I found something, which was the most important. on, I felt something different. And so I started to experiment with clothes and it made me feel the way I saw Caucasian people on TV. They were able to express themselves. They were happy. They were joyful. They were independent. And they had a sense of self that I'd never experienced in my home. And so my clothes gave me a window into the world that I could only have dreamt of. That knowledge at seven years old has encouraged me to see style as something that is so important to my life and everybody's lives around me. I knew that that was my calling, that I was destined to be a stylist. And that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to inspire people. I wanted people to see a future that they never thought possible. I started out as a designer at college. I created my own brands. I created three. I styled every one of my brands, every one of my photo shoots, every one of my campaigns myself. Then I started actually styling for a living, which is when I was approached by television networks to start styling for entertainment. I've been styling ever since. And it's something that I feel so, so passionately about because of how it makes people feel. Because I saw the impact style had on my own confidence, my own self-esteem, I knew that there were many of the people out there that probably felt the same way I did. And I knew that I'd learned so many lessons of my own along the way. Over those decades that I could help teach other people. And so now doing that as my job is the most empowering. Knowing that I can take somebody from feeling so down on their looks, so low, and to take them from that feeling to looking at themselves in the mirror thinking, I look darn good, is an incredible feeling. I have had... I was about to say something so inappropriate. Do you know what I'm just going to say? I have got so many people laid. That is... That is a blessing. Like the fact that I have encouraged people to date, to get what they want, I'd love to get a job, to get laid, is amazing. Like I never thought that that would be my lot in life. But I have people coming to me constantly, or DMing me constantly, or emailing me constantly saying, finally, I'm comfortable dating again. I'm comfortable applying for that position at my job that I never would have applied for before, because I feel the confidence that I never thought possible. Just because of clothes. Just because of great style. I think a lot of the time people are hesitant to believe that style can impact their life so greatly. And I do usually find a lot of resistance to that, especially in the job I do on TV. However, it takes one look, it takes one outfit change, and for them to look at themselves in the mirror and realize that they have a future laid out for themselves that was different to what they had planned. That's the moment that they realize that they have a future. And I think that's a great thing. I think that's a great thing. And I think that's a great thing. And I think that's a great thing. Oh, my clothes really do matter. Many of us don't have the luxury of playing with style as I have done for 20 something years. I want to be able to share that information with you, to share my mistakes, and to share my advice so that you can feel wonderful. Based on the amount of questions I get, literally hundreds every day, I now know that people are still struggling with just the very basic style. I want to take this opportunity to really lay out some fundamentals that are going to help every one of you. This class is very comprehensive. I'm going to talk to you about the basics, really breaking down exactly how style works. I want to talk to you about the rules and then how to break those rules. I want to talk to you about the things that you should probably never do that you truly want to avoid if you are wanting to feel your very best about style. I will be talking about how to incorporate print and color. I want to talk about texture with you. I want to talk about how to incorporate a lot of different styles. I want to talk about how you dress your body, the body that you actually have, not the body that you want, the body that you actually have. I want you to understand just how important clothes are for you and what you want for your life, how that can impact your life. I will be sharing with you the tool to create a style that works for you personally. And by the end of this class, you will see a true change in the way you carry yourself. I am a great example of living very much authentically, even if you're not a professional. I'm not a professional. I'm not a professional. I'm not a professional. Even though everybody said I shouldn't be. I go against the grain. I am a Muslim. I am a South Asian. I am an immigrant. I'm here in America as a gay man. And many people would say, you don't belong on TV. You don't belong representing our people so publicly. That's not the way I felt. I felt so strongly about what I wanted to convey, and I convey it, no matter who tells me otherwise. I want you to feel the same in every walk of life. I'm Tan France, and this is my Masterclass.",

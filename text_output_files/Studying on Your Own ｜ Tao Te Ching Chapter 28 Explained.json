Know the white, yet keep to the black. Be a model for the world. If you are a model for the world, the Tao inside you will strengthen, and you will return whole to your eternal beginning. Know the honorable, but do not shun the disgraced, embracing the world as it is. If you embrace the world with compassion, then your virtue will return you to the uncarved block. The block of wood is carved into utensils by carving void into the wood. The master uses the utensils, yet prefers to keep to the block, because of its limitless possibilities. Great works do not involve discarding substance. For today's video, I'd like to do something a little bit different. Usually, these videos take the rough format of me reading out the chapter, and then explaining my interpretation of it for about five minutes. But today, we're going to do something a bit different. For today's chapter, I'm going to point out a few specific parts of the text, and ask some questions about them, and then I'm going to ask you guys to try to answer them for yourselves. If you need some help, I will link some of the videos where we discuss these topics, just to give you some background if you would like it. You can find the links to these videos both in cards you can click at the upper right hand corner of the video, and in the description. While I do enjoy explaining my take on the Tao Te Ching to you guys, and while the algorithm probably favors my doing that, I think it's more beneficial for you guys to get really good at hearing the opinions of others, pondering them on your own, and then following intuition to come to your own conclusions. I don't expect this video will do terribly well as far as numbers go, but I'm fine with that, because I really want you guys to have a chance to put some of this stuff to application on your own. So with that in mind, I'll give you the questions. 1. What do you think is meant by the lines, know the masculine, but keep to the facts? 2. Why do you think the act of embracing the world causes the Tao to never leave you? 3. Why does it matter if the Tao never leaves us? 4. Why do you think we are advised not to shun the disgraced? 5. Why do you think Lao Tzu liked to use the analogy of the uncarved block? Go ahead and really ponder each of these questions for yourself. I recommend taking as much time as you need for this exercise, even if you kind of just chew on these questions throughout the course of your day. If you're in the Discord, I would love for you to come by the discussion thread for Chapter 28 and put your answers in there, if you would like to. If you aren't in the Discord, feel free to join, or leave your answers in the comments. As always, thank you for watching, and I will see you all tomorrow for Chapter 29. Peace and blessings.",

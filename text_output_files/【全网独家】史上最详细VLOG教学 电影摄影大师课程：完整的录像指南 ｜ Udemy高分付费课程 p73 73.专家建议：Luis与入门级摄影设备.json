Yes, we got to see him earlier in the course on that on-set experience that we did in our downtown Los Angeles video shoot. Now today what we're going to be doing is kind of just going over entry-level cameras, more professional cameras, shooting on a phone, and shooting on different ranges of cameras. And Luis and I are going to kind of just chat about what the pros and cons are of each type of equipment and really how far you can push each kind of equipment depending on the sensor and depending on all of its functions. So where do you kind of want to start off with? Do you want to start off on the lower end and then we kind of work our way up? What do you think? I can say I started where I started. I mean I started when I started filmmaking. I would say I have a good friend of mine named Yves. He's a really well-known videographer that does beauty work in e-com and mostly in the beauty world. But he started me off with this camera. It's a GH5 and to this day this camera is still the workhorse king. I mean honestly like you can get this camera for like less than two grand, maybe less than a thousand and you can put a variety of lenses like the 18-35, Canon. It's a micro four-thirds sensor. So what that means is like you can put a speed boost on it and it's like a micro four-thirds sensor. So what that means is like you can put a really just upgrade the lenses as you go. You could put all the way to like PL mounts if you wanted to. There is limitations when it comes to that. I mean there's things like what is it called noise and like stuff like that like low light. It's not a good low light camera or anything. But if you want to be a YouTuber and you want to get a good good good content commercial grade videos like this is the camera honestly because it has all the flavors. It's has the Panasonic you know codecs and stuff like that like pro you know not progress but video like MOV diamond you know those things that you can use for your editing and Ali and this camera I've used it for so long I I saw it by and so you know I buy and sell my cameras like crazy and I've had Sony's for the years of you know me and this one has been the most that has done the work for me I mean so you'd recommend this for people that are wanting to do more than vlogs this is more like short film like stylized video that I want more colored fidelity that you want to be able to color at an affordable price uh-huh and then we stood then like I mean this would you know the iPhone everyone knows iPhone they've went through a lot of generations and I feel that now since they added the the wide lens on this one it's been a workhorse on its own and it's on its own look you when you get that wide lens you don't you you realize like damn I never knew that I needed a wide lens and then you start getting really creative with your shots with the wide shots and all that but I like using this as like a director's a director's viewfinder and I use this app called filmic Pro okay and it's it's when they released the iPhone 11 Pro right they released this app and this app gives you all the flavors audio uh different video codecs slow motion and it activates more parts of the camera and then they have this thing called double take so if you're a vlogger and you want to like get a front and back interview of you talking to someone you can record both cameras so front and back and you choose the lens length so I don't know if you can see it so what it is like so see he's he I could see him and you can see the background but yeah there you go yeah so this is a good way to like if you want to get that quick you know like you can just like go to the like you know interview status or like right on the go because kind of like everything that's happening right now with Tick Tock and Instagram everybody wants to do like very uh quick and dirty you know like let's be quick let's get it really quick and go you know and that's kind of been my like my last resort kind of thing and I've had used this on a couple of beauty bloggers um when I went on set with them they wouldn't allow these cameras inside of a restaurant stuff like things they need permits so I will put this on a cage with a handle and an LED on top I put a small rig cage is what it's called and with audio and everything and this thing is fully ready to go and rig autofocus go and honestly a lot of people don't notice the difference they think it's DSLR sometimes so I would say that yeah like we're speaking on now smartphones specifically but yeah for that one it holds up really well when you do get to let's say color correction you want to push and pull colors around it kind of falls apart one thing I want to mention about if you are shooting on a video if you're using a camera that's going to be a little bit. smartphone and you're going in that direction because you already have maybe an iPhone 11 and you don't want to buy a new camera on top of that, it is a definite possibility. But what these phones do is they already optimize and bake in color correction, sharpening, stabilization on top of the footage. So it looks great coming out of the camera, but if you get some of those shots into your editing software and you want to update them, make them look a certain way, color them, stylize, it's really difficult. That's where the biggest differences are between shootings on something like this, that's a little bit more expensive, and then shooting on something that's a lot more practical. They're like Luis said, you can roll up in a restaurant and start shooting and get away with it. This is the kind of trade-off and also the dynamic range is another big thing. Although these are getting a lot better. So what would you say for someone wanting to go in this direction? What kind of equipment, you mentioned your rig that you have and will have. You have cutaway shots on screen. What are some must-have items that you'd recommend for the phone? For sure, if you're going to do the phone, a cage. Because if you get a cage with mounting points on it, those mounting points help to do like top rig, the tabletop shot. I've done tabletop shots many times with the iPhone where I couldn't rig up this big old behemoth down and like on up. And I did it before, but it requires a lot of work. Sometimes I'm a one-man band and they won't notice because it's a lot of work. And I'm like, I'm going to do this. And then I'm like, I'm going to use it. All right, great. Luckily, I got the right Zip sunshine last week. Yeah, I have a constructing device on right now. It's easy ones. It's brought in the box. So Okay, so, so, uh, so how we're going to do it. So — Our will be it because my phone is power planning to choose the boot. So, uh, on the printer it's an iPhone case? That's the investments where both expected OLED and the OLED audio will be on that machine. Now, BattleVista is out there and I haven't ever even as擊 this again. So I think it's way better footage this and the drone can get you know me so things like that and then it's lightweight you know what about audio what do you do so audio audio has always been a big issue because they got rid of the iPhone jack which is RIP but what I usually do is I get like a splitter that has audio jack or something but honestly I try to do again like a professional microphone like this is what I would use this is actually my microphone that I just got and I use it for it is this Rode NTG this is supposed to be the video mic Pro and an NTG professional microphone smashed into one and what I like about this one is that you can use it as a laptop mic so you can do podcasting that's what they made this for is for people that want to use it on our laptop connect it straight to USB C and get that podcasting kind of audio out of it and then you can just like put it on your laptop and it's like a little thing that you can just like put it on your iPhone and if you don't want to do that then you'll put it on your iPhone then they made a special TRS so whatever so you could put it on the iPhone and and but you have what you would have need their own your adapter that comes right",

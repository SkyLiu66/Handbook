I once, years ago, ran into a quote from Jerry Garcia where he said, style is the stuff that you get wrong. If you were actually playing the guitar perfectly, if you were making music perfectly, there would be no style. And I thought this was such a great quote and remembered it. And years later, went to find it on the internet, and the only place I could ever find it was me saying it in interviews. So. Maybe he never said it at all. But I do think that a writer's voice, which is huge, which is important, which is actually the thing that the reader responds to more than anything else, at the end of the day, is a result of getting to the point where you discover this is what you sound like. And the problem, I think, that a lot of young writers have is they don't sound like anybody yet. I know when I was a young writer, I didn't really sound like anybody. What I did was sounded like everybody else. And it's what you do when you're starting out. You imitate. You find voices that you like. You go, this person's doing something great. I would look at writers like R.A. Lafferty or Harlan Ellison. Roger. Roger. Roger. Roger. Roger Zelazny, Ursula Le Guin. I go, I love this thing that they do. I'll try and do that. It was very strange. I wrote a children's book when I was, what, 22? It was the first thing I ever wrote. It exists only in my attic and in manuscript. And it's not pretty good. But after Coraline came out, I thought, hang on, I have that children's book in my attic. I wonder if it's any good. And I went off, I found it. I read it to my daughter, Maddie, who at that point was six or seven. And at the end of the day, I sent it back up to the attic, where it resides and will reside until the crack of doom. What really fascinated me about it was there was about a page and a half, somewhere toward the end, that read like me. It read like the rest of it. It read like Noel Langley and Roald Dahl. It read like every children's author I'd ever read. And it's all coming back out again. There's nothing really original. I haven't figured out how to do anything. And that's great. And that's absolutely fine, because you don't have to get it right at the beginning. You start out by making mistakes. You start out by getting it wrong. The most important thing you do is just write. But there was just a page. And I looked at it. I thought, that's me. That actually reads like me. And seeing that felt wonderful, because it was the idea that, yeah, 22-year-old Neil, actually the voice was there. I just had to do a whole lot more writing. I think mistakes are not always the answer. Mistakes may be the most important thing for a writer. The question of how do you find your mistakes is very easy. You do stuff. The process of living, the process of trying to create, the process of getting out there and doing something is always a process in which you are going to screw up. You are going to break things. You are going to try things that do not work. You are going to try things that do not work. That's huge. Chuck Jones said, you have a million bad drawings in your pencil. And your job as an artist is to get them out so the good ones can follow. And I think as a writer, and especially as a young writer, your job is to get the bad words out, the bad sentences out, the stories that aren't any good yet. And you don't ever get them out. You don't ever get them out going, I'm going to write a really bad story now. I just have to get this out. You think it's a great story. You think it's a great idea. You think it's good at least. But the most important, and it may be, but the most important thing is just you get it out. You know, if you want to write an award-winning television episode, you're going to write episodes of television that the critics don't like. If you want to write an award-winning movie, you're going to write movies that the critics don't like. If you want to write award-winning short stories, you're going to write short stories that nobody reads, that don't really work. That's okay. And after you've written 10,000 words, 30,000 words, 60,000 words, 150,000 words, a million words, you will have your voice because your voice is the stuff you can't help doing. And your voice is going to be there if you decide to write a, Philip Marlowe-style hard-boiled detective story. Your voice is going to be there if you're writing a fantasy or a space opera. Your voice is going to be there if you're writing doctor-nurse romance fiction. Your voice is going to be there because you will have found it because it's the stuff that is going to be there anyway. Everything that you do as a young writer is going to be important in getting your voice. But the most important thing is just writing. The most important thing that will teach you who you are is you write. And you finish things if you can. I have up in my attic probably 100, 200 first pages, first two pages, maybe even the first three pages of things I wrote between the ages of 16 and 20. And I would just start short stories. And none of them ever sort of went anywhere. I had a setup. I had some characters. I wanted to see what would happen. And then three pages in, they'd sort of sputter and flame out and they'd be dead. And that was okay. And I'd start another one. It wasn't until I was probably about 20, maybe 21, that I realized that actually I had to start finishing them. And at that point, the improvement became, to use a word Terry Pratchett used to love using, quantum. Because as you finish things, you start to learn what it is that you did. There's a genuine improvement that you can start to see. You learn more from finishing a failure than you do from writing a success. And you definitely learn more from finishing a failure than you ever do from beginning something that is fantastic but stops. You can take a dozen short stories by me. You could take half a dozen novels by me. And on the one hand, they'd use absolutely different language. They have a different feel. They could almost be written by different people, except that they're obviously all written by me. There is a uniformity there. And it's not necessarily uniformity of word choice. It's not even a uniformity of voice. It's more about attitude. Each story has its own voice. But the attitude, the soul, the thing you take away from it, hopefully, that's all me. And that can be all you. I think if you're a young writer, if you're a writer setting out, trying to find the voice of a project, the most important thing is just take a stab at it. Sit down. Think. Before you start writing, just think. What are the most important things about the project? Does it feel like it's first person, third person? Who's telling you the story? Does it matter who's telling you the story? American Gods. I wrote the first chapter in the first person. It was told by Shadow. Got to the end of that first chapter and went, that doesn't work. And then had to stop and think, well, why doesn't it work? I thought, well, it doesn't work because you're inside his head, yet he is emotional about it. And I thought, well, why doesn't it work? And I thought, well, it doesn't work because you're inside his head, yet he is emotional about it. And I thought, well, why doesn't it work? And then he was emotionally closed off from the reader. And I knew that I wanted to write something in which, right at the beginning, you know, he's in prison and is emotionally closed off, and then he is told that his wife is dead and everything shuts down. And he is numb. He is dead inside. And now the book is going to be the slow process of waking up. going all the way down into death and then returning. I wrote the vast majority of it in a style that I like to think of as American transparent. It's what Elmore Leonard did so beautifully. It's what Stephen King, when he flies, sometimes does. It's the author is invisible. The words are there, the characters are there. You do nothing as an author to draw attention to yourself. There is a narrative voice, but a lot of the craft of the narrative voice comes in disappearing into the text. Stardust has a narrative voice. The writer is a character, and the writer, for me, of Stardust is a completely different kind of writer than the narrative voice. In my head, the narrator of Stardust is writing Stardust long before there's a fantasy genre. You're not, you don't have any kind of genre. You are just an adult novelist who is writing a fairy tale for adults, as people did in the teens, 20s, and 1930s. They would do that kind of thing. So I thought it has to be one of those. I like the idea. The writer was possibly even a woman. And again, you're finding a voice. So the voice of Stardust is very formal. It's slightly stilted. It's much lusher in some ways and feels a little bit antique in a way that the style of, say, Neverwhere, at least as far as I'm concerned, is a completely different thing. They are all third person. They are all narratives. But then you can get into stranger territory when you do something like The Ocean at the End of the Lane, which is a novel which is a first person narrative. And at that point, the important thing becomes the voice of the narrator. So for The Ocean at the End of the Lane, I wanted to write something told to us by a narrator probably in his mid-40s. And I think that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to write something that was a little bit more of a story about what he remembers of being seven, of this story coming back to us. It needed to be told from an adult perspective. But the deeper he goes into memory, the more it had to be absolutely from a kid's height and from a kid's eye point of view. So at that point, you're looking for a style that is... not a particularly writerly style. The important thing about it is that it is the voice of somebody who is just holding your hand, looking you in the eye, and saying, let me tell you what happened to me. Which is a fantastic kind of narrative voice to use. It's one I've used over the years. I used it in a graphic novel called Violent Cases at the beginning of my career. Used it in Mr. Punch. I've used it in a bunch of short stories. It's incredibly dangerous if done well, in that it's convincing. You really are just saying to somebody, look, I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm gonna tell you true things. I'm just hold my hand. We're gonna walk together, you and I, into a dark place. But I'm here. It's all safe. I'm holding your hand. And then you walk them into a dark place, and you let go of their hand, and you run away. And leaving the person just going, oh my gosh, I thought I trusted things. I thought I knew what was going on, and I really don't. So if somebody were imitating me, probably that would be, that particular style would be a fun one to go in and imitate.",

    "data": " Fiction stories are one of the most interesting phenomena that human beings have. Human beings are storytelling creatures. We tell stories. Stories are vital. Stories are important. We can go back later to why they're vital. We can go back later to how they're important. We can go back later to how long they have been around. But the important thing to understand is that stories are part of us, and we convey truth with stories, which is fundamentally the most gloriously giant contradiction that you can ever imagine. What we're saying is we are using lies. We're using memorable lies. We are taking people who do not exist and things that did not happen to those people in places that aren't. And we are using those things to communicate true things to kids. Now, whether you're looking at—and to each other. I mean, not just kids, but it begins with kids. You tell a child the story. You tell a child the story of Little Red Riding Hood. And there are lots of takeaways from that story. But one of the takeaways that is always taken is, you know, there are people out there who may not mean you well. There are people out there who, when they say, where are you going? What are you doing? You may not want to tell them. That might get your grandmother eaten. Might get you eaten. There are people it is best to avoid. So, I think that's a good thing. Some people, some wolves are hairy on the inside. And some wolves are hairy on the outside. And perhaps you are best keeping yourself safe. And it's a true thing. It's a good thing to learn. It may be not something that we are automatically told. So, a story like that gives us that as information. You're telling a reader something that you hope will stay with them. Something honest. Something important. Something vital. Something that you can tell them. But you're using lies. Little Red Riding Hood never existed. Wolves don't eat grandmothers and then climb into beds disguised as grandmothers. And if they did, Little Red Riding Hood would walk in and go, that is a wolf. She would not be sitting there going, grandmother, what big eyes you have. Oh, the better to see you with my... And wolves can't talk. But we understand that. We as human beings are really good at taking that information. That is the magic of stories. That's the magic of fiction. Because it's giving you something big and true and important that you might not otherwise get. And you can carry it in your heart. And you can tell it to your children. And to your children's children. The story of the wolf. The story of the wolf. The story of the wolf. I began Coraline with a quote that wasn't from G.K. Chesterton. Although I said it was. I said, fairy tales aren't true. Fairy tales are more than true. Not because they tell us that dragons exist. But because they tell us that dragons can be defeated. That, for me, was the important thing about Coraline. The idea that... That dragons can be defeated. I wanted to tell my kids something that had taken me 30 years of living to figure out. So when I was writing Coraline, I wrote the first third of the book. And then we moved to America. And I had been writing Coraline up to that point in my own time. When I had free time, I would write it. Now we've moved to America. Everything has got a lot busier. And there was no free time. And nobody was waiting for it. I'd been told by a publisher that it was absolutely and utterly unpublishable what I was doing. So the desire to keep going... I wanted to keep going. I knew that I had to finish it. But I was happy that I had a third. And I knew that one day I would get to go back to it. And then I was walking with my children in the woods. And I trod on a yellow jacket nest. The yellow jacket nest was under the ground. And within a couple of seconds, I was surrounded by a cloud of people. I was surrounded by a cloud of yellow jackets. They're like small wasps. And they're mean. And I shouted at my children to get away. And stayed exactly where I was. Because I knew that if I ran after them, the cloud of yellow jackets around me would follow me. And it would get to them. So I waited till they were at the top of the hill. And getting stung the whole time. And then ran after them. And I remember climbing into the bath. I put all of the three of us into the bath. They were very small. And counted the stings. I had about 39 stings. And each of them had been stung once or twice. And the problem was in shaking my head. Like that. To try and dislodge some yellow jackets. My glasses had gone flying. Which meant that the next day, I needed to go down. Go back to where that had happened. And get my glasses back. And that was terrifying. Going back to get my glasses was scary. Standing there, getting stung. While my kids ran away. Was not scary. There was absolutely nothing brave about it. Going back the next day. To find my glasses. That was brave. And that moment just sat there. And it sat there for me informing everything that I felt like I wanted to know. That I felt like I wanted to write Coraline for. And I suddenly knew a third of the way in. What the book was about. I'd been writing a scary book. I knew that it was about the idea that dragons could be defeated. I knew that I was trying to tell kids that yes, you can face up to the things that scare you. Yes, you can deal with it. Yes, you can triumph. But it was at that moment that I understood. That actually what I was just trying to say to them. The entire message of this book. Was. Being brave doesn't mean you're not scared. It means you're scared. And you do the right thing. And you do it anyway. And that gave me a handle. Into the rest of the book. That gave me a place to walk. Into the rest of the book. And it meant that. When I took Coraline back into the other world. Now her parents had been kidnapped. She knew they were there. But the action of going back. Was now scary. And it should be scary. What is wonderful. Is now here we are. Almost 20 years after Coraline. The book was published. And I will do signings. And I will do events. At every event I do. Every signing I do. There is a woman. In her late teens. In her 20s. Now even in their 30s. Who have a battered. School printing. Edition of Coraline with them. And they're the ones. Who just stop. And they tell me very, very quietly. That the book. And Coraline. Is a story. That saved their lives. In their teens. When they were going through. A very bad place. When they were being abused. When. Parents marriage falling apart. Bad things happening at school. And they would tell themselves. That if Coraline could get through. What Coraline got through in the book. They could get through that. But the best thing is. About it is. I told them a giant lie. And I went through a. Door that didn't exist. Talk about a girl that doesn't exist. A place that doesn't exist. On the other side of it. Is her other mother. With buttons for eyes. Who definitely doesn't exist. And everything that happens in there. Was made up. By me. It's not true. But it. Helps them. It carries them through. It is true. And they took the true things from it. And that human beings are able to do that. Is so important. So gratifying. And so cool. All fiction. Has to be as honest. As you can make it. This I believe. This may not be true. For every other writer out there. It may not be true for any other writer there. But it's true. For this writer. You have to make it. As honest as you can. Because that's what people. Respond to. As far as I'm concerned. Any success. I have achieved. As a writer. Of fiction. I have. Achieved because I'm an honest. Writer of fiction. Because my people. Are real people. Because you care about them. The hardest time. For me. Was starting out. As a very. Very young. Writer. I wrote short stories. And I sent them out. To places that could conceivably publish them. And they all came back. And I looked at the stories. Which went out. And came back. And went out. And came back. And I thought. Okay. Well. I'm going to write. A story. That's going to be. A story. That's going to be. A story. That's going to be. A story. That's going to be. Well. One of two things is true here. Either. I'm not good enough. Or. I don't understand. The world. I don't. The stuff I don't get. The stuff. I need to know. And I thought. Okay. So. As of. Today. I am now. A freelance journalist. Specializing. In the world of publishing. And writing. And writing. And writing. And writing. And publishing. And fantasy. And science fiction. And I decided I was a journalist. Because I thought. That gives me license. To ask questions. It gives me license. To go out into that world. And meet everybody. Find out who everybody is. Find out. What they do. Find out how they read. To learn. And then. I got invited. To a conference. And I was. I was. I was. I was. I was. I was. I was. I was. I was. I was. I was. I was. I was. I was. And I guess I had a sense of time. And I guess I was a reader. And that got me back to what I wrote. And that got me back to. I started to realize that I haven't. Like nobody's writing or a writer of its own. And what I've grown. And what I've grown through. And when you look at what I wrote. You could have read the national multiple. I τον Jasmine. Or maybe 많 어�. I wasn't a person. Like I hate poems. Like I couldn't do any. I doesn't write. I wasn't a author to write some. That kind ofצ But I learned. Better to write novels.yond stories on a much deeper level. They were reading different stories to what I was reading. And I realized I was reading the stories as an audience. And they were reading stories as craftspeople, as people who built these things, as people who did this. And I also realized I was wrong. I was wrong if I wanted to be a writer. And they were right. And that experience, more than anything else, I think changed me. And it changed me mostly because I realized that in order to write fiction, I needed to be honest. Up until that point, I had a facility with voices. I could do essentially impressions of other writers. I could do things that I didn't want to do. And I could do things that I didn't wish I did. I could write things that felt kind of like things that other writers would have written and written well. But I didn't have anything to say. And that wasn't because I hadn't lived. That was because I wasn't really prepared to say anything true about who I was. I didn't want to be judged. I didn't want people reading any of my stories to know my story. And I didn't want to be judged. I didn't want to be judged. I didn't want people reading any of my stories to know my story. And I didn't want people reading any of my stories juegoes que estoy viviendo unballs qol China que no sabes nada. who I was or what I thought or to get in too close. And I realized that if you're going to write, if you're going to be a successful writer, at least if you're going to be the kind of writer who did the kind of stuff that I was going to do, you had to be willing to do the equivalent of walking down a street naked. You had to be able to show too much of yourself. You had to be just a little bit more honest than you were comfortable with. And if people judged you, if they felt they knew who you were, that was just something that you were going to have to live with. And what was strange is once I started doing that and I was expecting to be judged or shunned or people's opinions or to have to deal with things. And what I discovered was actually their opinions were, we really like this. We love this story. That's a good story. It felt huge. It felt personal. And I realized that's because I was being honest about me. And some things, when you get really specific, apply to so many of us. So that was how I took my darkest period and eventually turned it around. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is my most personal novel. It's the one that really is about a seven-year-old me. And it was a very uncomfortable book to write because it had to be too honest about who I was, about what I felt when I was that age. The great thing about being an adult writer, writing from the perspective of a seven-year-old boy, is I was a seven-year-old boy. I have that in my armory. I didn't need to go out and interview seven-year-old boys, meet seven-year-old boys, talk to seven-year-old boys, because somewhere inside me is the seven-year-old boy that I was. So I started writing a short story. And the protagonist was very much me, me, age seven. The family wasn't really my family, but the house and the environment and the place was my house, my environment, my place. What then started happening was the more that I wrote remembering what it was like to be seven, the more being seven came back to me. Things that I hadn't thought about for 40 years, for 50 years, came flooding back. In the same kind of emotional, I guess, space that you're in, when you go back to a town that you lived in 30 or 40 years ago, and the first time you're there, everything seems very strange. And then you go, hang on, if you go down here, that's that road. And all of the spaces suddenly start to make sense again. You haven't been there for a long time. You didn't even think you knew it. Yeah. Yeah. But it's in there waiting for you. So writing yourself and going back to your own past and visiting your own past, as a writer, you're not writing autobiography. What you're doing is lying. But you're using the truth in order to make your lies convincing and true. You're using them. You're using the truth as a seasoning. You're using the truth as a condiment to make an otherwise unconvincing narrative absolutely credible. It is vitally important that whatever engines you might have used to convince your teacher that your homework really was eaten by the dog now come out to convince the reader that you're not lying. And I think that's a very important thing. So one of the things you talk about when I have on this podcast is is, is there any... Eight out of thousands of books does have some material attribution that some books would use to explain data sea enough to find evidence that there is evidence� wall an吧 or investigation Sound of kinds of books that come out likezego from 1500oi But you're not gonna look it up, because as a board member, we're yeah, you're gonna never have a true abundant.ol coming up to me, people writing to me, saying, you wrote my childhood. None of those things happened to me. My childhood wasn't like that, but you wrote about my childhood. You wrote about me. And I did, because I was writing about me, because I was being honest, because I was being specific. And if you're specific, then what you say that's true applies to other people too. But you have to be willing to just open your chest a little bit too much and show rather more than is comfortable of your heart and of your mind.",

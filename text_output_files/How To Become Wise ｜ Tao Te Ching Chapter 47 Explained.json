The more knowledge you seek, the less you will understand. The master understands without leaving, sees clearly without looking, accomplishes much without doing anything. There is a big difference between knowledge and wisdom. We tend to think of knowledge and wisdom as being largely the same thing, but they are not. Knowledge is the accumulation of information. Wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge with good judgment. Knowledge is knowing about things, but wisdom is the ability to understand and wholesomely interface with them. There are extremely intelligent people who are not wise, and there are extremely wise people who are not all that intelligent. Knowledge will not make us wise. Actually, knowledge can work against wisdom if we are not careful. Albert Einstein once said, The other problem with acquiring too much knowledge without also acquiring wisdom is the danger of our starting to think that we know everything. Few things are more detrimental to the acquisition of wisdom than pride. Pride puts the brakes on wisdom, and strangles our ability to respond. A prideful person cannot be taught by the Tao, because a prideful person does not think that he or she needs it. Humility and wisdom go hand in hand. We often think that wisdom comes from the collection of many different types of exceptional life experiences, but this also isn't true. Wisdom and life experiences are available to anyone, whether they have the means to travel or not. It is not necessary for us to comb the world in search of experience and wisdom. This is because true wisdom comes not from other people or things, but from Tao. We come to be truly wise by pursuing humility, quietness, and openness of mind, and by listening to the Tao. Immanuel Kant, one of the most influential philosophers of the Enlightenment, famously never left the city limits of his small German town, and yet his theories were immensely instrumental in the construction of modern philosophy. You may agree or disagree with Kant on numerous things, but it is hard to ignore the philosophical breadth of his work, all from a person who literally never got more than 10 miles away from his house. If you are interested in cultivating greater wisdom, the place to start is not in books, in travel, or in the meeting of other people. These things can append your knowledge, if you can properly apply them. But if you are interested in becoming wise, the thing to do is to start carving out regular time to interface with Tao. Meditation is a great way to do this. If you are religious, you can use prayer. Open and honest contemplation also yields good results, just as long as you remain open to being taught by Tao. Thanks for watching, and I will see you all next time for chapter 48. Peace and blessings.",

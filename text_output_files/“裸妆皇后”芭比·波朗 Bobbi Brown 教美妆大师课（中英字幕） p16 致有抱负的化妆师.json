As a makeup artist, you almost have to be a little bit of a shrink to make sure that everybody is happy. So every time I would go to work, I would have a meeting with the photographer, the stylist, anyone around, and the actress or the person and discuss what we're doing today. Because if you understand what you're doing, then at least it'll be easier. You won't have to change and fix things. So when you are working with an actress on a press tour or on the red carpet, it's usually she is the one that you have to please. Sometimes there's a stylist you have to please. I've been on shoots where there's a mother you have to please. I've been on shoots where there's a boyfriend you have to please. So you have to kind of work together. And if you are a makeup artist starting out, my biggest advice to you is show a mirror to the model. Make sure that they are happy with the way they look. Well, that's cool. You're going to get a lot better pictures for your portfolio. She likes it. Yay! So make sure that it's a team effort. And if you're struggling with something, because we all have bad days when we're doing makeup, just ask someone to step in and help. I am not good with putting false eyelashes on. My assistants for years have been doing the false eyelashes. And it just makes me realize what I'm good at, what I'm not good at. I've been really lucky in my career. I have worked with some of the best photographers. And I seem. To work with them for different periods of time. Henry Lutwiler is someone I work with constantly. What I've learned working with him is how perfect the right lighting, the right team is to an amazing photograph. I was lucky enough to work with Bruce Weber a lot who didn't like makeup. And so I would do makeup. So it didn't look like the girl was wearing it. I think that's where I learned a lot. I worked with. A big Vogue editor who liked. Very beige lips and a certain creaminess. And she taught me how to use foundation mixed with things, how to change things on the face. Working with Arthur Elgort for so many years was amazing because first of all, he's someone that. While you're doing the makeup, he's already done the shot. So he's quick. He's fast. And what I learned from Arthur, he would come in and describe how he wanted the girl to look depending on some movie. French movie, Italian movie, La Dolce Vita. I didn't know what he was talking about half the time. So I really had to figure out what he meant. And that's why I tell young makeup artists now, be well read, watch old movies, go look at beautiful actresses from the 30s, 40s and 50s. When someone says we want a Claire Bow something, who is Claire Bow? Like you have to know who it is. I work with a younger photographer named Ben Ritter. Who? Who can get more pictures done in one day than I've ever seen. And he's quick. He's easy. He would rather me not waste my time and energy covering up blemishes or things that sometimes maybe are really hard to retouch. He'd rather have it with no makeup on it because he could just do a quick retouch to get rid of it. And the only reason I know that is because we've communicated about it. So I always would ask the photographer, I see this happening. There is a scar. What should I do? I'll leave the scar. I love it. Or try to cover it. So again, not being afraid to be communicative to the photographer is everything. For me, having a kit of makeup that has everything in it is amazing. But so many times I haven't had everything in it and I figured it out. I was once at pre-fashion week where you go in and talk to the designer. And you literally have to do a look and the designer has to say yes or no. You see them on the runway. And I noticed on my kit that my assistant forgot to pick my lipsticks. I also know that Anna Wintour was coming to look at the look. So I didn't panic. I didn't yell at anyone. I just grabbed a brown eyeshadow and a lip balm and I made a dark lip. And that was like a few moment. The designer loved it. And Anna Wintour commented to someone that it was the best look. It was the best look of the season. It's so easy to panic and not realize that you can figure this out. Even if you have no idea what you're going to do, you can figure this out. And the best thing is don't panic because if you panic, you're not actually seeing. If you can almost pull yourself back for a minute, assess the situation. And then if you need a minute, take a minute. If you don't have a minute, you've got to figure it out. I have more than once been in a situation where I'm working with a photographer or a team that definitely wants a makeup I'm not comfortable with. I don't find it pretty. And it's been a little bit of a struggle. But because my personality likes to fix things, I've worked towards making it the best situation possible. And you have to be a little bit of a chameleon if you're a makeup artist because you have to be able to move and change quickly. You have to. You have to be able to know when to do something to the makeup. And you have to sit there watching. So when I was a young makeup artist, there were no cell phones. There were no digital things to look at. And I would have to sit on the set and watch the makeup. I also couldn't be in the next room doing something. I had to be right there. If they called my name, I had to be there. I see now often you're at shoots and young makeup artists are on their phone. I don't know what they're doing, but they're not paying attention. And they're, oh, they'll fix it. Later. You know what? You don't want to be in a profession or a job where you're not caring about every little detail. I care about the details. I care that things are the best they could be. Also, personally, as a makeup artist, I love people to push me into things I've never done before. I'm not comfortable with. And I try to figure it out. I love working with photographers, stylists that say, why don't you try this? Why don't you do this? I like to try because guess what? If I don't like it, I could just. Take it off. So when I was a makeup artist in the beginning, everything was my portfolio. And you would take pictures. You would work for free for a photographer. And your payment would be you would get pictures, which means slides or negatives. Sometimes they'd give you prints. But then you would have to go take the negatives and pay for prints. And put them in your portfolio. And I was constantly removing things around and editing. And then you would start to work in magazines. And you'd have pictures. And you'd put them in your portfolio and try to make it look good. And you would go on go-sees. You'd go meet people to be hired. Now, it's so much easier, guys. Instagram. Open up an Instagram that's not you and your friends dancing. That's not your baby. Open up an Instagram. Open up an Instagram. Open up an Instagram. That is just your work. It is free. You don't have to hire someone to build you a website. Put your photos on there that you love. Put photos that you are inspired by. Get yourself out there and use the visual aspect of showing people who you are. And then, by the way, that's how you meet and talk to other people is through Instagram. And there's so many tricks. You know. That you could do. That you could meet people. And you never know how you get jobs. I booked models through Instagram. I found some models that, you know, weren't working anymore. And I was doing a book. And I'm like, will you come back and do this? So, it's kind of amazing right now to be able to use social media to promote your business. It's not all glamorous. I've helped women going through chemotherapy who have lost their eyelashes, their brows, their hair. I actually got hired, and I still get chills, to talk makeup to an organization which was Women of the World Trade. It was literally about eight months after 9-11. And I went in to a very big place with a lot of women and a lot of babies they were holding. And I walked in to start talking and I burst out in tears. And one of the... Some women came up with tissue and hugged me and said, it's okay. And I said, but this seems so irrelevant, makeup. And they said, you know what? Even if it's for a minute and we feel better, that's part of healing. And I've had a bunch of those kind of interesting situations. I've worked with Dress for Success. I actually brought it in to Bobbi Brown Cosmetics. They were one of the people that we helped. And I would have my artists work with these women. Because they were literally going from welfare to work. And we taught them how to look appropriate for a job interview. But I also, besides makeup, I always used the opportunity to talk about the things my mom taught me. Arrive on time. If something's not working, ask someone for help. Don't be afraid to be communicative and say, you know, you're having trouble with something. So I've kind of put my skills together. And I guess I'm just basically... I'm a Jewish mom. And I really do, you know, love helping people. And makeup is a really powerful tool. And for all of you guys that are watching that are not wearing makeup, sometimes it's just a lip gloss. Sometimes it's a blush. What could you do to make yourself look better? And to all the artists out there, you're so lucky to be working in a profession where you actually could take your skills and help people and make them. And to all the artists out there, you're so lucky to be working in a profession where you actually could take your skills and help people and make them. And to all the artists out there, you're so lucky to be working in a profession where you actually could take your skills and help people and make them. Look better. There are a lot of people that need you out there. And there's a lot of opportunity for great careers. It's not just working for magazines and doing the glamorous makeup work. There's so much out there. There's weddings, bar mitzvahs. There's lessons. There's so many things you could do. There's so much out there.",

    "data": " That should give you an overall good understanding of those main functions for your camera to really set up, you know, the kind of scene that you want. Ideally, you're setting your shutter speed to a 50th of a second if you're shooting at 24 frames per second. The apps on your phone will let you change those manual settings of the frame rate that you're shooting. For talking videos, for vlogs, for anything that you're not shooting cutaway shots of, which we'll get into when it's someone talking, you pretty much always want to be shooting 24 frames a second. That gives it a very natural aesthetic and really pleasing looking shot. If you're shooting above that, like 60 frames a second, that's a lot better for slowing that stuff down and doing slow motion. That doesn't look good for talking shots. So the main takeaway here is that for your talking scenes in your vlogs, when you're shooting, when you're talking to the camera, or when you're interviewing someone else who's talking to the camera, you want to have your frame rate set at 24 frames a second. You want to have your shutter speed doubling that, which is going to be 150th. It can be 160th, okay? You want to have your ISO as low as possible, because the higher the ISO, the more it's going to add the noise into the image. But you use the ISO to boost what you're not getting enough of light in your scenario when you have your other parameters set to that more cinematic looking standard. And then you're going to use your aperture to adjust how much you want the background or foreground to be out of focus. So hopefully that makes sense. If you have any more questions about this portion of the video, please feel free to hop into the Q&A and ask. If you have no questions, I will see you in the next video.",

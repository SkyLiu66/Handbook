How do you build it up? How do you know if your idea has legs, if it's going to go anywhere? We're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about how you build a short story, how you build a novel, how you build a plot, how you find out if you have an idea or a notion or a concept or something that actually might be able to stand up there on its own two legs as a novel. I, especially during the Sandman years, would worry and think and obsessively ask myself questions about what is a story? What is a story? I'm making these things. They're how I feed myself. They're how I feed my family. They're how I pay the rent. What is a story? And eventually, what I decided was the story is anything fictional that keeps you turning the pages and doesn't leave you feeling cheated at the end. That was my definition. My son, Ash, is three years old, just turned three, and his favorite game is to stand next to me on a bed or on a large sofa and go, what's going to happen? And then I have to go, I don't know what's going to happen. And then he jumps in the air and falls down on the sofa. This can go on for weeks if you let him. He just thinks, what's going to happen? The what's going to happen game is the best game in the world. The what's going to happen game is the game that you play as a writer with your readers. What's going to happen? And that is what keeps them turning the pages. Things they don't know. Things they need to find out. Things they care about. And coming into a story, it can just be things like, who are these people? What are they doing? Why should I care? That's a bit odd. After a while, it can get a lot deeper. It can be, is she going to kiss her? Is she going to poison her? Does she know about the missing will? Did they know that grandmother's body is still... in the room upstairs? What's going to happen? I wrote an essay. Once, a very small essay. In a book called Stories. And... it was called Just Four Words. It began when somebody wrote into my blog, Dear Neil, If you could choose a quote, either by you or another author, to be inscribed on the wall of a public library children's area, what would it be? Thanks, Lynne. I pondered for a bit. I'd said a lot about books and kids reading over the years, and other people had said things pithier and wiser than I ever could. And then it hit me. And this is what I wrote. I'm not sure I'd put a quote up if it was me. And I had a library wall to deface. I think I'd just remind people of the power of stories, of why they exist in the first place. I'd put up the four words that anyone telling a story wants to hear. The ones that show that it's working, and that pages will be turned. And then, what happened? The four words that children ask when you pause telling them a story. The four words you hear. The four words spoken or unspoken that show you as a storyteller that people care. And then, what happened? And those words, I think, are the most important words there are for a storyteller. So anything you can do to keep people turning the pages is legitimate. But the main thing that you have to do, is to care. Because if you don't care what happened, nobody else will. If you don't care about these people, nobody else will. If it doesn't matter to you what happened next, nobody else is going to give the smallest toss. So you need to care, and you need to imbue that care. And that's what I'm trying to do. It's important that this was as real as possible, because you need to adapt to the more realistic situation. You need to move from one character to another, with a truly clear image of where you want things to be. And the more기 twoah... The long,온y эффņce you can put in to the story. You need to takece pourut the research into it by your own mouth. The reaÏts watched ing the stories, that you wanted it to be about, if... Twohyour, you % trighte ejemplo, o you haveura, and ismaÏvabáyou? project, you are starting from scratch. Whether it's a comic, a graphic novel, whether it's a novel, whether it's a short story, whether it's television, whether it's a movie script, you're starting something completely new. One of the best things that you can do is just sit there. I like to do it by hand if I can. I will take out a notebook and I will write down everything I know. And it's a giant brain dump. Sometimes there'll be little doodles. Words will get circled. This is not an essay for people to read. This is me telling myself right up front just everything I know. The process of writing is a really important one because even in the process of writing, anything simple, your mind starts to notice connections. And connections are what fiction is made out of. So stories begin with ideas. And the idea can be very, very small. It can be a feeling. It can be an image. It can be something that you, it can be something your story begins with. It could be something you're writing about. It could be something you're writing about. It could be something your story ends with. It could be some moment from the middle. It could be two characters interacting. Mostly you don't know an entire story or I don't know an entire story. I will write it to find out what happens. But I have something going in. The question then is, is that enough to start a story with? Sometimes if it's a beginning, I have to have a general idea of where it's going to go. If it's an end, I need to know how we got there. I've been writing long enough that I have a certain amount of faith in myself. And I think faith in yourself is something that you need. Because the process of writing, it's Wiley-Coyote. It's Wiley-Coyote running along a cliff and then still running. And he's fine until he stops and looks down. So as a writer, part of your job is not to stop and look down and go, there is nothing underneath me. Because then you will fall. It's a process of just continuing to run toward the place. But you have to know where you're running to. Very often, something that I'm going to want to know before I begin is what it's about. And I'm probably really not going to find that out until it's over, until I sit there and reread it. And I go, what was this about? But I need to have some kind of idea of what it's about going in. And that isn't, it's not a plot. If anything, I guess you could call it theme. For me, it's just, what is this about? I'm going to write Neverwhere. I have an idea of people living under London, a world under London. I have this idea of the idea of a hidden London, the idea of giving London place names. Literal meanings. So there really will be shepherds in Shepherd's Bush. That's an idea. What's it about? What it has to be about? And this is what I thought going into it. And it was also, wasn't entirely what I discovered it had been about at the end. But it was what I went in with, was just going, okay, I want this to be about the people who fall through the cracks. I want to write about homelessness. I want to write about the mentally ill. I want to write about the people who have fallen through the cracks in big cities and are living rough on the sidewalks, who are living as they can. And I want to do that in a way that anybody reading it is going to enjoy it. And they will come to it unconvinced and not necessarily know that that's what it's about, because if I sat down and said right, I'm writing a big book about homelessness, the only people who would pick it up and read it would be people interested in a book about homelessness. What I want to do here is write a book about living in a big city. I want to write an adventure. But I want to write an adventure which, when people finish reading that story, they're going to look at the homeless. They're going to look at the people sleeping in the shop doorways. They're going to look at these people and they aren't going to pretend they're invisible. And that, for me, suddenly crystallized the metaphor. I mean, for me, so much fantasy is about making a metaphor concrete. What it's about for me is the way that we treat the homeless as invisible and treat them as non-persons. Good. Then they're going to essentially be invisible. They're going to be non-persons. How do I build up from that? And I have my hero Richard, Richard Mayhew, and he encounters a girl from London Below, from this other London that exists beneath and all around London. He helps her. He saves her. And in so doing, he becomes part of London Below and discovers that people can no longer see him. He goes into his office. They don't know who he is. Right. ATMs no longer give him money. Taxis won't stop for him. He has become an invisible un-person. And now he needs to go into London Below and the plot needs to happen. So a lot of what I'm doing is going, okay, I have an idea. The idea is this kind of London above, London below thing. The what's it about then carries me a lot further into it. What am I trying to say? What am I trying to tell here? There is an old line that, you know, if you want a message, you use Western Union. And that may be true, but really, if you're writing something, you have to have something you want to say. It has to be about something and it has to be about something for you. I'm not saying everything needs a giant social message, but I am saying you need to know what your story is about. . Young writers, because young writers are peaceable souls, because young writers want to live in a happy place, because young writers have had enough conflict in their lives already, tend to shy away from conflict. And you will read short stories by them and you'll go, but there, that's the place where you're, . . . . . . . . . . . . there are people who think your two characters are meant to bounce, and meant to collide. This is where the plot is meant to get tough. This is where things are meant to get difficult for people. But they'll avoid it. And making young writers face conflict, making them write conflict, making them realize that there are so many different ways you can solve problems of conflict, . You have to have the conflict first. You can attack something head on. You can go around it. You can attack it surreptitiously. You can deal with it with strength. You can deal with it with intelligence. You can go into it and you can fail. You can go into it and you can succeed. You can go into it and neither succeed nor fail, but create an outcome that was completely unexpected and sends everything off into a whole new direction. You can succeed, but in succeeding, make things worse. There's all of these things that you can do in conflict, but you have to allow the conflict to happen. And that is so much of what a plot is. If you're building a story, you have a whole bunch of building blocks. You have the words and the language. It's going to be a huge part. Just the voice of the story. What does it sound like? What is your narrative voice? What do your characters sound like? That's huge. The next is the characters. Who are they? What are they doing? What do they want? I'm going to harp on a lot about what characters want. I'm going to harp on about what characters want because over and over again, you'll find when you're plotting, when you're putting something together, it's the only question that opens the door to what do you do next. If you get stuck, you can ask yourself what your characters want. And that is like a flashlight. It shines a light on the road. It illuminates the sky, parts it into a place that isела to you, sun. I don't know when you'll read aまる's piece but you don't have chance to stop being saying what they want until you're inside the galaxy. I don't know if you've said that. No. Well, guess you have. Maybe that is part of the million thing, right? Maybe that is part of the million thing. Because they want to see you. Mama. Okay. Don't they want to see me soon. But nonetheless honestly, I encourage you to use that SC to go for stop from when your character shows them. Because fifty-five seconds of a story were blown away, and that's it. Okay. But when you're thinking, well, would it be worth breaking the wall if you hadauer me? I want to share a little something. Yeah. things that are mutually exclusive and then set them off on their quest. And you know that only one of them can have the thing, whatever the thing that they want is. If they succeed, the other one fails and vice versa. And now let's get them going. That's got to give you conflict. It's got to give you a plot. And sometimes the what does a character want will surprise you. You know, it's not just they want the money. They want the boy. A lot of the time it's they want to learn. They want to grow up. They want to save their friend. They need, and so it's what do you want? What do you need? And that as a driver is always one stage below the mechanics of plotting. And it will save you. It will save your ass over and over as a writer, if you take that as an important thing. And remember that characters always, for good or for evil, get what they need. They do not get what they want.",

She's framed on the thirds, we're at a good distance where if she was talking to the camera explaining something we would be able to connect with her and it would look aesthetically pleasing. If we were to go from 28 millimeters to something much more zoomed in like 60 millimeters this is a completely different focal length that creates a completely different feeling. She didn't move, the camera didn't move, what she would be doing wouldn't change but this would completely change the way you would feel about what she was saying. So it's something to really keep in mind when you're setting up your framing. You want to always be thinking about how you want your viewer to feel. So if I move it back out to a little bit wider this is now we're at 24 which is a little bit too wide for the situation but what I want to do before we get to the next step is to move the camera a little bit to the right. So what we're going to do before we wrap up here is of course when we just went to 60 it was too close but if we move the camera further back and keep our subject where they are and now what we did was we moved about 10 feet away from our subject and we zoomed in to 70 millimeters. So at 5 feet away from our subject 70 millimeters was way too close but with 10 feet distance if you have that kind of room to move around in your scenario you can actually get a really good shot of what's going on in the frame. So that's what we're going to do here. So we're going to do a really great compressed image with a very shallow depth of field by moving far back and increasing your focal length making the number go higher which creates a much more telephoto field of view. So you guys can see the difference between 5 feet away at 28 millimeters and now 10 feet away at 70 millimeters. Same scenario different focal length different distance from the subject to the camera completely different aesthetic.",

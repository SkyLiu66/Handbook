A lot of tinted moisturizers come in tubes. Some come in jars. And you could apply it with your fingers, with a brush. And you just literally put it on as if you're putting moisturizer on. You could also make your own tinted moisturizer with a foundation and a moisturizer. And it will give a little bit of a healthy glow. And there are many women out there, myself included, that don't really like foundation. I don't like the feeling of it on my skin. I don't think it makes my skin look better when it's noticeable. But a pencil or a tinted moisturizer on me is my favorite. I use a lot of the sticks more for set work and for people that like more coverage. And I literally put it on first and decide where you need to fix any kind of discolorations or spots. I'm going to put a little bit on her forehead. And Anna definitely has a little bit of sun, so it's very normal for foreheads to be darker. And how do you know when it looks good? When your skin has a glow and it just looks even and beautiful. I'm going to be using a concealer under the eyes because she doesn't need a lot, but a little bit really makes a difference on everybody. So I'm using the complexion sticks to really just correct things. So there is, if there's any kind of brown spots, again, this is the same. Same color as her skin. You just apply it to the brown spot and gently blend it in. Any kind of discoloration, you could use it to lighten. And then I'm going with a lighter color under her eyes. So that one is actually a little too light. So I'm going to go with one that has... Yeah, this one is better. And this has a little bit of warmth, so it blends in with her skin. But see the difference? One side to the other. And you don't need a lot. So I'm applying it under the eyes where it's a little dark. And if there's any kind of... purplish, or some women get black under their eyes, this tone, which is kind of peachy, will really just take care of it and get rid of it. And when applying it, you have to make sure that you're tapping it and not wiping it, because if you wipe it, it will be away. And if you are someone that's dark in the inner corners, Anna is not, but you just go on the inside to lighten. And you can see that it's lightened up. I didn't use moisturizer on her because she had a tinted moisturizer, which is all-in-one. And she also has really, really good hydrated skin. So I knew that I could use the stick without an eye cream. And if you ever use an eye cream and then a stick, and it kind of slides off, it's too much eye cream. If your mascara gets all over your face, and you think you're someone that can't wear mascara, I guarantee it's not going to work. It's going to be a little bit of a mess. And I know that's because you have too much eye cream or too greasy of a concealer. And what I love about Anna's look is she's so unique and so cool and so pretty. I knew she was going to smile. And she doesn't need a lot of makeup, where I think a lot of makeup would take away from her beauty. And that's why I really want women to learn that the right makeup enhances your beauty and doesn't take it away. It does fakturize the strong translucence. It does pretty pulls it off. It is very short-weigh like by virtue of the size of my fingers. I love it. I very much like that.",

So this video is going to be the first in what I hope will be an 81 part series, where I take a chapter from the Dao De Jing each day and make a short video where I break it down a bit for you guys. My goal for this series is to upload a chapter every day until I finish the Dao De Jing, except for Sundays which are going to be my days off. Now, I'm doing this for a couple reasons. One is that honestly, I feel like it's some pretty easy content that a lot of people will enjoy. The second reason is I want to try and push myself a little bit to see if I can keep up with the daily uploads. And lastly, my hope is that when this series is completed, I'll have put together a kind of a resource that can act as a bit of a free beginner's guide to the Dao De Jing for anybody who might find it useful. This way, it can just be kind of sitting there on my channel in a playlist to where people can use it as a way of reading the Dao De Jing for the first time if they haven't done so already, or they can look up specific chapters that they might have questions about. I think it's kind of an exciting concept overall, and I hope you guys enjoy it. If you haven't read the Dao De Jing all the way through yet, I would invite you to come with me on this little journey. I hope you enjoy it, and I'll see you in the next video. Bye! I'm just going to upload another short video each day on the next chapter, and you can follow along. So with that, let's get into chapter 1 of the Dao De Jing. The Dao that can be told is not the eternal Dao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth. The named is the mother of the ten thousand things. Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations. These two spring from the same source but differ in name. This appears as darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery. Alright, so this chapter is a little esoteric, so let's go ahead and break it down piece by piece. The Dao that can be told is not the eternal Dao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. I've heard a lot of people going on about how this passage means that we should never talk or write about Daoism. Now, I think this is silly because these lines are literally taken out of a text. So, if we are maintaining that Daoism is the beginning of heaven and earth, then we should never talk or write about Daoism. If we are maintaining that Daoism should not be talked about or taught, then we are saying that the entire Dao De Jing is nothing but a massive work of hypocrisy. So, I think we can rule this out. What I think is really being said here is that however well you can describe something, you're never really going to hit it on the head. Because of this, names and descriptions of things are imprecise, especially when we're dealing with something as complex and mysterious as the Dao. I think Laozi, the alleged author of the Dao De Jing, is basically saying to us that the writings in this book cannot possibly describe the Dao in any sense. So, I think we should just go ahead and write about it. So, I think we should just go ahead and write about it. So, I think we should just go ahead and write about it. So, I think we should just go ahead and write about it. So, I think we should just go ahead and write about it. This is true of anything, really. You could have a friend describe the Grand Canyon to you for hours and hours, and you'd never be able to wrap your head around what it's really like as well as you would if you had stood on the edge of the real thing for even just a single minute. Words, names, and descriptions of things are not the things themselves. In order to really understand the thing itself, you have to really experience it in person. How do you experience the Dao? Well, let's look a few lines down. Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations. So, one of the main principles of Daoism is this idea of overcoming desire rather than allowing our desires to overcome us. We'll talk about this a lot more in future chapters, but for now, let's focus on these lines. Our values, desires, and perceptions shape the way that we see the world around us. Our values, desires, and perceptions shape the way that we see the world around us. We're given the power to think and interpret the environment. Do we see it in what we see? Are we able to see the world around us? How do we interpret it? How can we see the world around us? Do we see it differently? How can we see the world around us? Can we look at it in a different way? How can we see the world around us? How can we see the world around us? Do we see it in different ways? And yet, describe it in completely different ways? Well, this is because we human beings are just not very objective in the way we perceive and interpret our environments. Let's take a hypothetical situation of two kids walking down the sidewalk, and that they come upon a stray dog. Let's say that one child has a dog at home that he really loves and plays with often, and that he has never had a negative experience with dogs before. Now let's say that the other child has no dog, but once he was bitten by a neighbor's dog so badly that the dog had to literally be pulled off of him. Child number one sees this dog and probably perceives an opportunity to enjoy the company of a kind animal. Child number two might see this dog and perceive nothing but a threat to his safety. Which child is right? Well, the answer is we don't know, because we don't have enough information yet. But now say the dog comes running toward the two children. Child one, based on his experience, sees a dog coming to play. While child two sees a dog running up to attack. Both children are so involved in the story of what they have previously experienced that neither child is able to perceive the possibility of anything else. Neither child is seeing reality. Both are seeing only a replay of a past experience. Taoism tries to teach us to put aside our prejudices, experiences, and desires, and to learn to see things as they truly are. This is certainly not an easy thing to do, but part of it is to acknowledge that you have a predisposition to see the world in a certain way. This is not an easy thing to do, but part of it is to acknowledge that you have a predisposition to see the world in a certain way. This is usually a way that legitimizes what you already believe. And I'm not talking about just politics, or current events, or left versus right, or anything like that. I mean, when you go outside your house and look at the world around you, can you keep yourself open to receiving the information that each thing is presenting to you about itself, rather than projecting your own inferences onto the world around you? The answer is no, you probably can't. And neither can I, for that matter. We just haven't learned to do that yet. This is a process that starts with learning to accept the world, as well as circumstances in your life, for what they really are. This doesn't mean that you never get to do anything about them, but before you can do anything about them, you have to see them for what they are, and in order to do that, you have to accept them as they really are. We're going to talk about this a lot more in later chapters, but for now, we can just walk away with the understanding that we do not understand the world around us completely, because of what we are unable to accept, because of previous experiences we are holding onto, or because of what we want to be true. Hence the line, ever desiring, one sees the manifestations. This is especially true, when we're trying to understand the Tao. In order to do this, we need to be able to put aside our notions and predispositions about it, and really just get waist deep in it for ourselves. I hope this is making sense so far. If you guys have any questions about this chapter, or you have any suggestions about the series, shoot me a comment and I'll try to answer. Until then, I'll see you next time for chapter two. Peace and blessings.",

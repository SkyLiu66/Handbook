So what we're going to do is we're going to do a learning exercise on shooting one shot in two different ways. Okay? What we're going to do is choose one subject or object or scene or whatever you want to shoot, and we're going to shoot it two different ways. Okay? The first way is going to be on auto settings or improper settings. Okay? The information before what you learned in this course so far. Okay? So overexposed, the ISO is all wrong, the shutter speed is all wrong, or the aperture is not really ideal for what you're shooting. And then you're going to shoot it a second way, which is going to be the upgraded way with what the information that you learned so far. So what I want you to really... do is apply yourself on this learning exercise and use the proper ISO, shutter speed, picture profile, white balance, aperture, and focal length. You guys are more than welcome to do either a video of you talking or a photo of an object that's at your house or outdoors. Really whatever you want. Something to get creative with. And you're going to export that video link or screenshot with the standard shot first, and then the upgraded shot to the computer. And then you're going to go to the course Q&A and share your before and after of not using what you've learned, or maybe the way you would have shot it before, and then using these techniques to shoot something in a much more aesthetically pleasing way. So I'm going to cut to me doing this too right now along with you guys. At my own house, I'm going to choose something to shoot. I'm going to shoot it the improper way, and then I'm going to shoot a second much better image.",

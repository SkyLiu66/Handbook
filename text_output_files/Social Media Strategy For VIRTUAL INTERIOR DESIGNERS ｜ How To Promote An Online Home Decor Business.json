For a virtual designer, the most important thing is to have a strong online marketing, even more so than if you were a regular interior designer, since potential clients will rely on your online presence to discover you and get a sense of your style and talent. If you are a virtual designer or are thinking of starting a virtual design business, you're at the right place. We will look at how is marketing a virtual design business different from marketing a traditional designer and how to promote your business across multiple online channels. Hello there, welcome to my channel. I'm Simona, a certified interior designer with over a decade in social media and content marketing. From social media to marketing tips, my goal is to equip you with the tools and knowledge you need to grow your design business and convert your followers. So if you are ready to take your business to the next level, be sure to hit that subscribe button and turn on notifications so you don't miss out on any of my new videos. In many ways, virtual designers have it easier than traditional interior designers. You can work exclusively from the comfort of your home, you don't have to travel for any client meetings, and the pool of your potential clients is much larger, spanning countries, even continents, compared to if you were focused just on one location. Having said that, being a virtual designer is a very important part of your life. So if you are a virtual designer, you should be able to take your time and focus on what you want to do, and see what your potential clients want to see. A traditional designer is not without its challenges, especially when it comes to social media and marketing in general. It can feel overwhelming and you might not even know how to start marketing your skills. Traditional designers would typically focus on building relationships and getting personal contacts with other industry professionals who could then refer them to their clients. For you, the whole internet is your playing field. But how do you convince someone to pay for your services without that personal contact? It might feel harder to build closer relationships with your audience, but that's not to say that it cannot be done. As a virtual designer, there are two things to focus on. Choosing the right platforms to target your ideal client and creating the right kind of content that speaks to your ideal client and serves as a pre-filter to weed out those who would be after in-person design services. First, let's look at how to choose the right platform. To market a virtual design business, your approach to social media should be different to a standard interior designer. In short, your marketing efforts should be focused on driving qualified leads to your website. This means you would spend more time and effort on driving traffic to your website than, let's say, networking in Facebook groups. So you definitely do need a website and ways to get traffic to that website. Now, you can pay for ads to drive visitors to your website, but in this video, I will be focusing on social media and organic, that is, non-paid ways for how to do that. And when we talk about interior design, and website traffic, there is one platform that should be your number one priority. That is Pinterest. Pinterest can be used in many ways. Normally, designers would use it for research, to gather inspiration, and to share inspiration for projects with their clients. In terms of driving traffic, your Pinterest strategy should include pinning new images that are linked to your website, whether it's to your homepage, your portfolio, or your blog posts. Pinterest is used by people from all around the world, which plays into your website's success. So, if you're a designer, you can use Pinterest to do that. But it's not a good idea to use Pinterest to do that, because it's not a good idea to use Pinterest to target people from just one location. You just need to make sure that your content is visually appealing, and that your pins make your potential clients interested in learning more. To do this, you can use not just beautiful images, but also text overlays that will act as a sort of a teaser for more content. For example, five ways how you will save money on hiring a virtual designer. Now, Pinterest works more like a search engine than a standard social media platform. So, the most important thing is to use Pinterest to do that. The more often you can pin new images, the better for the algorithm. You want to pin fresh content often, both to your own boards and group boards in your niche, as this way your pins will get in front of new audiences. The good thing is that you can delegate or outsource parts of this process, and there are also tools to make this easier for you, like Canva or Tailwind. I talk more about both in this video, along with tips on how to make the most out of your Pinterest profile, from optimizing your bio to expanding your reach with groupboards. If you've been here for a while, you might know that Instagram is my specialty. There's a good reason why. It's a prime marketing tool for interior designers, as you can attract people from anywhere in the world, especially when you are strategic about creating content that your target audience is interested in. At the moment, reels are the best way how to drive new people to your profile, so your Instagram strategy should definitely include them. You can also use other types of content, like carousels and stories, to keep your audience interested. You can also use other types of content, like carousels and stories, to keep your audience interested. You can also use other types of content, like carousels and stories, to keep your audience interested. But since your focus will be less on building relationships and more on driving new people to your profile and, ultimately, to your website, it makes sense to prioritize reels. I made this video about reels, and it has a lot of advice that is applicable to virtual designers as well, so I suggest that you watch it at some point later too. Now, even though you might never meet your client in person, don't be afraid to show your face and personality in your Instagram content. It doesn't matter how much you like your content, it doesn't matter how much you like your content, it doesn't matter how much you like your content, it does help people to relate to your brand. I know, I've just said that your focus should be on attracting new people, but still, if your followers feel more connected to you and see your brand as relatable, it will help them make the decision to hire you. Virtual Design For a lot of people, virtual design might not be a familiar concept. To make them more familiar with it, you can try to answer the questions they might have and educate them about what virtual design or e-design actually is. You want to make them feel at ease when working with you, and not question whether they should have gone with a traditional designer. You can do this in a variety of ways. For example, explain the differences between virtual and traditional in-person design in a series of Instagram posts, a blog post, or a YouTube video. Create a day-in-your-life kind of reels, where you show how you work on client projects. Host an Ask Me Anything Live on Instagram, where you ask questions about your clients' work, and how you work with them. You can also show your clients how you work with your clients, and how you work with them. You can also show your clients how you work with your clients, and how you work with them. You can also show your clients how you work with your clients, and how you work with them. You can also show your clients how you work with your clients, and how you work with them. You can also share your clients' work with them. Frequently asked questions about virtual design Talk about the benefits of virtual design compared to in-person design services, such as lower costs and the ability to work with clients from anywhere in the world. Oh, and whatever content you create, always keep the tone conversational instead of salesy. The time to close a deal will come later, once people actually inquire about your services, not when they just landed on your profile. Use newsletters to nurture your audience. Once you've got people who are interested to know more about your brand, and signed up for your mailing list, keep nurturing these leads with regular newsletters, so that you remain in front of their eyes. Only rarely do people hire someone when they first land on their website, and newsletters can be a really good way how to warm up these client leads and gain their trust. You can also offer exclusive discounts or promotions in your newsletter, and introduce a new kind of service that you've just launched. To grow your email list, create various freebies, aka lead magnets, to get new people to sign up. Your lead magnets can be a collection of design tips, a color guide, or a checklist. Whatever freebie you create, it's important that you test it across several platforms and keep promoting them so that new audiences see them. For instance, you can post a link to your freebie in your Instagram bio with an appropriate call to action, or you can share the link to your freebie in your stories so that people will get to your website after clicking on it. If you're interested in learning more about the freebies, you can also check out our website, which is www.learn-from-a-blog.com.

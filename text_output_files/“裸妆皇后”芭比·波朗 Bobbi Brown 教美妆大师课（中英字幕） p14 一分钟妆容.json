As a working mom, a working makeup artist, and someone that did school drop-off, I know the importance of doing your makeup in a minute, and I've done it many times. It's not that hard. You just need one to four things that work on you that you could use at more than one place on your face. Okay. So I'm going to start. I'm going to skip foundation. I'm going to start with a little bronzer, a little bronzing cream that literally just wakes up your face and just adds color. It's also instead of a moisturizer. So it's your moisturizer. It's a self-tanner. It's a little bit of a cream bronzer, and you just throw it on. Okay. You're done. If you have oily skin, you can use a little bit of a powder. Then no foundation, but just a little bit of quick concealer. Not a lot, because most of us in the morning just need a little something. So a little bit under the eyes. Again, you just do it and take your finger, put it right in, throw on a coat of mascara. One coat makes a big difference. And if you have time, quickly, you could literally look put together by just putting a little bit of something sparkly on your lid. And one last thing, if you can get some kind of a cream blush where it goes on your lips, on your cheeks, you are done. Okay. You look put together, and it takes two seconds because everything just goes on. No brushes, no opening compacts. It's all done. And you could do it in the car. All right. Maybe the back seat, but you could do it in the car. Maybe you could do it in the car. All right. Maybe you could do it in the car. All right. Maybe you could do it in the car.",

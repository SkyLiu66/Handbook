    "data": " The ancient masters were subtle, mysterious, profound, responsive. The depth of their knowledge is unfathomable. Because it is unfathomable, all we can do is describe their appearance. Watchful, like a man crossing a winter stream. Alert, like a man aware of danger. Courteous, like visiting guests. Yielding, like ice about to melt. Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood. Hollow, like caves. Opaque, like muddy pools. Who can wait quietly while the mud settles? Who can remain still until the moment of action? Observers of the Tao do not seek fulfillment. Not seeking fulfillment, they are not swayed by desire for change. So here we are getting a description of masters from the past. Lao Tzu is invoking images of past sages for the purpose of showing what they were like, so that we can emulate them and their behavior. These masters were careful, deliberate, and slow to action. When crossing a winter stream, one wrong step can lead to disaster. It is a task that requires the utmost caution and care. Not that the masters were fearful, we don't have any justification in the text for thinking this, but they were careful and alert. Dealing with other people often requires delicacy and nuance, but often we treat people around us as if it didn't matter what we said or did. Not the ancient masters, though. They always tread with care and kindness. They purposely put themselves in the low places. They did not seek to be raised above anyone else, or to be celebrated because they understood that such behavior only inspires envy in others. Instead, they sought the low places, the functions of least honor. They treated others as if they were always their guests, always prepared to yield their own desires and plans should the situation call for it. Here we also get into a bit of a characteristic theme of Taoism, the uncarved block. In a world where people are so determined to make something of themselves, a sage prefers to keep him or herself simple, unadorned, and open to all possibilities. Now, there have been about a billion different interpretations of the uncarved block, and there are countless explanations for what it is supposed to mean. So rather than give just one interpretation, I think I would rather just explore several different properties of an uncarved piece of wood, and let you use your own intuition to draw your own conclusions. An uncarved piece of wood has many advantages over one that has been made into something. An uncarved block is in its natural state. It is the way nature has made it. It doesn't put up pretenses about being something it isn't. Wood that has been carved into a spoon, or a flute, or a statue, has one function, and is locked into that function forever. It has resigned itself to one duty, one task, one nature, and in this has become rigid and inflexible. In becoming one thing, it has closed the door to all other possibilities, all other lessons it might learn about itself, all other talents and potential that may lay dormant and undiscovered within it. An uncarved block of wood understands that, there are basically infinite possibilities for how it might be useful. By residing in its natural state, it leaves itself open to any of these possibilities. One could also argue that the uncarved block is referring rather to an unadorned, or a normal piece of wood, one that has not been decorated or ornamented. Through this lens, the uncarved block might be seen as an invitation to turn from the vanity and self-aggrandizement of the world, and to be content with that beauty and usefulness that emanates naturally from a living being, without having to artificially enhance one's appearance. There are a lot of lessons we can learn from the uncarved block, and I would rather you come up with your own interpretation, using your intuition, rather than to lay down a dogmatic interpretation for you to swallow. Therefore, I recommend you contemplate this analogy for yourself. The examples I've offered are merely to be taken as material to get you started. Moving on, we've already talked about the value of hollowness and emptiness, so I won't say much about it just now, but I'd like to draw your attention to the last part of the passage. Who can wait quietly while the mother is waiting? Who can wait while the mud settles? Who can remain still until the moment of action? When a pool has been disturbed and become murky, there is almost nothing you can do to clear it up of your own accord. You can't scoop out the silt or force it to separate from the water. The only course of action that is left for you is to patiently wait until the mud settles on its own. Any attempt to take action before this moment results in merely muddying the waters further. This may be interpreted as a lesson that in life, there are many circumstances where our direct involvement or action is not necessary. This may be interpreted as a lesson that in life, there are many circumstances where our direct involvement or action is not necessary. and can even be detrimental. Certainly, there is a time and a place for action. But wu-wei is the principle of being able to follow intuition clearly enough, to be able to discern when it is time to act, and when it is time to merely allow events to take their course and to trust the results to nature. If you can do this, you will find that the mud will often settle on its own, and that which was previously murky will become clear to you at last. If you can detach yourself from the need to be in the center of everything, If you can detach yourself from the need to be in the center of everything, you will leave yourself open to seeing things muddier. If you can detach yourself from the need to be in the center of everything, you will leave yourself open to seeing things muddier. If you can detach yourself from the need to be in the center of everything, you will leave yourself open to seeing things muddier. Because you will be open to seeing and hearing the information that all things give about themselves. I'd be curious to hear how you guys have interpreted this passage. So if you have any thoughts you'd like to share about it, let me know, and I'll see you all tomorrow for chapter 16. Peace and blessings.",

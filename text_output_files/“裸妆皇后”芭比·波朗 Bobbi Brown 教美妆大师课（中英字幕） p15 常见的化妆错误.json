What's wrong with this look? The brow is way too dark. No one should ever use black shadow. And there is some kind of a highlighter under that's really yellow and not right for her skin. And I'm not sure what's on her lip. There's something very pale and pink, and I personally don't think it's that pretty. So first the brow. I'm using a cotton swab. And I am hopefully going to be able to take off the eyebrow, which I believe was just a black shadow. It is way too dark. It looks too hard. So my suggestion is go for the darkest brown you could find. Even if you have black eyebrows, go with a really dark brown. Sometimes you see a trend, and the trend might be overdone brows. Please leave it. As a trend, it's why I'm not a big fan of trends. This cotton swab is soaked in micellar water, which honestly is the greatest way to take your makeup off in a hurry. It's not oily, and it just really takes everything off quickly. Already it looks better. And even though she does have black eye makeup, it's not going to be too dark. She does have black eye makeup. She does have black eye makeup. She does have black eye makeup. She does have black eye makeup. She does have black eye makeup. She does have black eye makeup. She does have black eye makeup. She does have black eyebrows. There's brown in her hair, so I would definitely much rather use a brown. So first off, I am going to use a brown shadow. Still filling in her brow. Still making it right for her, looking good. And still filling in the hole. but not over drawing it. I'm brushing it up. This is way softer. Also the shape of the brow, this was just done too thick. You cannot draw shadow where there's no hair. So that was definitely overdone. Still strong on her brow, but see how much better it looks? But I'm also going to further lighten it by adding just a little bit of face powder to really take the edge off. Again, it's face powder. That is hard to see. That's her skin color. Okay, see the difference? Next, I am going to replace this yellow shimmer with one that looks way better in color and way better in placement. So again, this is just micellar water on a sponge. Let that dry for a second. I am just using a complexion pencil just to even out the skin. So here I am. Color. Now, what she had on was yellow. So I think if we're going to add something, I'm going to add something a little more coppery, and it's going to go right on high on the cheek. Okay. So I'm going to add a little bit of pink. It was down there before. No, it needs to go high up here. See? Yeah, kind of a big difference. That's just way too much and in the wrong spot. Okay, see the difference? And I don't know what was bugging me more, the eyebrows or the lips. I don't know. I don't know. This lipstick is too matte. It is way, way too white. And honestly, it took all the beautiful natural color off her lip. So this is just a balm, and I'm taking it all off with the balm because when you want to do a nude lip, you want to do the color of her lip. And because a lot of women have two-tone lips, I would never want to use a pale pink lipstick and take away the beautiful natural color. So what I would recommend, that is a little bit more matching of her lip color. I mean, truthfully, I love her lips as is. But let's see if we just add. And I actually really love when it's deeper on the outside and pinker on the inside. I think it's so beautiful that I might just leave it like that. I would much rather use a gloss that is sheer, has a little color, and this one has a little bit of flex in it. It's got a little pinky tone, so it's not fighting. But the main thing is it's transparent, so you can actually see her beautiful natural lip color. I think it looks way better. So little teeny tweaks actually make a big difference. By softening the brow, by getting rid of that over-highlighted cheek in the wrong color, and certainly by putting a more flattering lip on, I think it made all the difference in the world. It's just a much better, more modern look. Big difference. Subtitles by the Amara.org community",

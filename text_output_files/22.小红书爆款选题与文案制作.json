    "data": " Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Then the image you draw is in large size. I set two covers before. One is for comparison. The top is the image, the bottom is the real person. But after I made the cover of the image, I found that the overall data was not very good. It didn't run very well. Then there is another question about the size. Then we try to set it to 3-4 in the first picture. You can see that my overall is 3-4. Then I also saw that some of our students The base they published Some choose 3-4. Sometimes choose 1-1. Sometimes choose 16-9. I was 16-9 at the beginning. I also sent 3-4. Then I also sent 1-1. But in the end, I suggest that students Just use a 3-4 ratio. Fixed with a 3-4 ratio Then choose the comparison picture Then my comparison picture is Real person image is a small picture. On the one hand, I am trying to show The image I painted. The second is because Many users are more suggestive Is to enlarge your own real picture. So we try to choose a small picture. Of course, if you want to put someone else's image You still need to communicate with others in advance. In my way, I usually send one. For example, I will send you one. Then can I send a small post? Then some people may suggest their own Real person photo. Then I will discuss with him. Can the small picture be? Most of the time Is willing to accept Then you can put a small picture. Understand? Then the pure product display picture Can also be done. For example, I really don't have this This real person photo He really doesn't want to put it. You only put your product display picture. For example, like us That is a pure image of your production. It's okay. But this effect. It must be worse than the contrast picture. Understand? You will find why the teacher He must be a real person. And the image you draw He will have one of these Why must this contrast picture be made? Because on the small pig platform Your cover contrast picture It is always larger than A simple picture display. Understand? Then the main body is outstanding. The picture is clean and the color is harmonious. And emphasize the notes. Look at this. What is this? This can be written. Just write a flower. Just your cover. You can write a flower. Of course I didn't write it. The reason I didn't write it is because I'm lazy. I don't have much time to adjust the cover slowly. You can also write a flower. If you are a student here. For example, you go to the small pig platform. Search for AI images You will find that there are many of them. They wrote the flower, right? What flower should be understood? That is, in the cover. In addition to contrasting pictures He will also write some more clever words. But these words are best to highlight your advantages. For example, like me. I may write Disney princess style. Right? It will emphasize my style of painting headdress. It's my personal selling point. Other people's headdress may not be this style. But mine is relatively closer to It's very similar to the real person. Then a Disney princess style. Understand? This is my product selling point and advantage. You can also find yourself. For example, I am a Japanese style, right? That is Japanese headdress. You can write it on it. Understand? Then the picture. The picture. Try to choose multiple pictures. I see that some students send single pictures. This is not possible. Try to choose multiple pictures. Then mine is more than three pictures. More than three pictures. You can be three to five. Three to five. Then I often do single pictures. Because you look at my store. It's 19.9 yuan for one. Right? Then 49.9 yuan for three, right? Then there are 79.9 yuan for five. Then five. I'll use it directly. Right? Then three. You can also use it directly. Because I basically have more than three. One. For example. Some people do single pictures. Then I'll put three people together. Three people put a note on the side. Three people put a note on the side. You can also do a few more pictures yourself. For example, he is single. You really can't. You just choose the one he chose as the first picture. Then the rest. You are choosing yourself. Anyway, when you are in the middle of the painting. You are not just one. You will also be divided into four, right? You can also choose some other to match. To match. Then match the text. To match the dimension. And the theme. The main subject is clearly displayed. It's not the main subject. I read the wrong word. The main subject. I won't force you to do this. This is relatively simple. Some of them are relatively broad. You can probably understand it. Then the details of the subject. This is a must. Like us. I see. I want to emphasize a little bit. I see that we also have other students doing this avatar account. Then I saw some students. Actually, it's pretty good. But why? But I will find that his picture quality is not high. That is to say, for example, some people don't pay attention to these aspects. He directly sent the picture of the painting to WeChat via WeChat. Then compressed it once. Then upload it to the small book. You have to pay attention to your original picture. Your original picture from the computer. Right? To your WeChat has been compressed once. Then from WeChat. Then upload the small book again. Compressed again. So he is relatively speaking. How is it? It's relatively speaking. The quality of the picture is not high. Understand? Another one is that you guys are in the picture. Try to set the quality of the picture. Relatively high. Right? I have taught my students this last night. Is to improve the quality. Then try to reduce the compression of the picture as much as possible before uploading the picture. Right? Then you can upload it via email. To get it. It's relatively better. Understand? Okay. Of course, you can also go through. Directly through the small book. The back stage is the computer. For example, your computer will draw. You can directly go through the computer of the small book. To upload your work. It's okay. Right? Just try to reduce the compression of the middle picture. Because I saw a classmate. He draws pretty well. But the picture he uploaded is really poor quality. Then basically they are all in the same place. It's more blurry. So you have to pay attention. Because you are doing the picture. The picture has a core focus. Is the picture. If your picture is too compressed. The picture is too inaccurate. It actually means. Your handwriting quality is very low. The quality of the notes is very low. Understand? All students. Come on. Understand. Kouye. Understand. Kouye. All right. Because I can't see how many of you are now. And then I can't see you talking. You can ask anything. You can also ask. So the title. The pain of the audience. You can look at my title. How do I say my title? First of all, I told him. My title is now. Because I used it the earliest. Such a mode. Is to draw a little sister's portrait with a dense juni. Then. Then add another. The words. In fact, you should all be able to see it. Right? And then it's relatively simple. You can also use my template. Use my title template. Of course, except for mine. You can also use other people's. Is the title template of the newspaper. Simply put. Because what I wrote in here is relatively. How to say. It's more official. But if you follow the actual operation. I've been doing this for so long. Little red book. I basically find the title of the newspaper. He. Must be able to report again. That's another one. Just pay attention. That's the first sensitive word. Little red book is very sensitive. The title you wrote. I saw a student writing the title two days ago. He didn't change the title of the sensitive word. Like some what sin. He wrote it directly. We like me. I usually say something like sin. That's like a sin. I'll hit this sin. That's the one with the grass head. Such a sin. And then there are some sensitive words. You have to change it. Must change. And then there are some. Some students say that they haven't changed. For example, I borrowed someone else's newspaper. No one changed. I want to say this. This is about some of the problems of the whole. Some people. His account. For example, he's been doing it for a long time. He has a certain weight. It's okay for him to write some sensitive words a little bit. But if, for example, you are new. Right. The signal must pay attention to the sensitive words of your audience. Your published documents. The title of the publication is better. All over again. The sensitive word test website. And then the sensitive word test website. I should also be in that toolbox. Just update it for students. It's a practical tool bag. It's your first-hand manual. There's a practical tool bag in the first-hand manual. I should update the website for my students. You can take a look. You can use it. And then try to avoid some sensitive words. Especially the title. Especially the title. Emphasize it. And then the title. I've written a few things here. It's the need to hit the user. Causing emotional resonance. It's a little bit. And then. Let's talk about it here. Try to use the question and the exclamation. I'll use more of the exclamation. If you use it, try to use the question or the exclamation. Don't be so ordinary. And then there's the trick. Use numbers. If there's a number in your title. Then please use Arabic numbers. The little dragon tree is more friendly to Arabic numbers. Try to use Arabic numbers. And then you have to use the emoji. Use the emoji. The emoji I'm talking about here. Not the little dragon tree. The emoji. The emoji. It's your cell phone. For example, you can download a search. Search input method. And then in the search input method. Use some emoji emojis. Understand? So I'll say more. Use the numbers. You at least have to have one. Why? Do you know why? Actually, I changed it before. I did it because I used to do little dragon trees. It's not convenient to tell you what to do. When I was doing that little dragon tree. It's the kind of more scientific. And then at the beginning. At the beginning. I didn't use those emojis. Then there was a time. I just put my content. To compare with other people's content. Its cover. When I compare. I found that the title of others. Other people's titles. It has that kind of. For example, the red big blood. Emotional. Question mark. Or bring some. Emotional. It will really attract people. The same two notebooks. The same notebook. With emoji and without emoji. He is for. Eyeball. The eyeball of the eyeball. The attention of the eye. This point. It's different. So I'm telling him a little bit. Say a word. Say a word. Say a word. It's called a phenomenon. Imaging. Phenomenon imitation. What is a phenomenon? Imaging. Many students are. When you were doing a account. There are many students. He may be. For the little red book. Notebooks. Or for this platform. The operation method. He is not very understandable. For example. Like what I wrote in here. Ah. Use numbers and expressions. Many students. He actually thinks. Almost. This is right. Almost a gentleman. For example. Others. It's obviously written. Arabic number one. You changed it. The big one. Others use this little expression. You don't think it's necessary. Fight. Separate. Right. I'm not going to tell you. If you. You want to imitate. Your target account. Right. Please do the phenomenon. Imaging. What is the phenomenon? Imaging. It's exactly the same. One to one imitation. But I'm not saying. What do you have to do? It's the same. The same. One. It's exactly the same. No. I said. The phenomenon. Imitation. It's. It's. You. It's. You. Do this account. Let others. It looks like. I think. It's done by the same person. Understand? Not to say. Your content. To be exactly the same. Your title. The words. To be exactly the same. All of you. Like. The previous two years. That student is also. You can't say. Hey. Your this. Ah. Your profile. Your introduction. Ah. Your all. All exactly the same. Not this. But. But. Say. Do. The phenomenon. One to one. The imitation. Understand? Just. Let others think. These two accounts. It's done by the same person. Understand? Just like me. Open another account now. Right? My account now. Called. This. Beautiful girl loves you. Right? Original beauty. Beautiful girl loves you. Then I can open another account now. Then this account. Others. Look. It's me. Why? Because. My style is there. But others. When imitating me. He. He. There must be some difference. If you can. Imitate. It's. One to one. Then this is. It's good for you. To start a account. Understand? Don't. Don't think about it. Do it yourself. Do it. Imitation. Imitation. Come. Can you understand? Understand? Give me a flower. OK? Can you. Can you. Pick up flowers? Can you. Give me a flower? It seems to have this expression. Can you. Brush a little flower first? Is there? I didn't see. I saw the flowers. Can I post it? I can post it too. Then. Come. Can you understand? Give me a flower. OK? So this is. The one. This is the imitation of the phenomenon. This question. Then. The case. The case. This is simple. Just. If it's broad. You take a look. It's. The content is true. Not too much. This. Just. Simply. Say. Show. The content of the product. Then. Describe. If. The credibility. Not. Big. Share. The core. Selling point. Then. A little. The difference. Why? I. This. Simply. Say. Because. If you. Someone. Go. Look at my notebook. You will find. I actually. Didn't write a essay. Actually. Didn't write a essay. Then. Some people will say. Teacher. Then. Is this. Not important. No. It's important. Just. How to say. Just. I'm lazy. Just. I'm lazy. Then. Because. What I did. This. Like. The style of this notebook I made. It's actually. The core. Is in the picture itself. Every notebook. All represent. My product. Show. My product. Selling point. Is. This. Actually. Is. The picture. Bigger than the text. Right. I made it. That's it. I don't have to say. You look at it yourself. If you want. You also want the same style. You look for me directly. Right. You want. The same. This image. You can also look for me directly. At this time. Is the picture. Bigger than. What. The text. But if. Classmates. For example. You go to do some. Other. For example. The same. Type. For example. People sell. Sell. This. Sofa. You also sell sofas. From the appearance. Actually. It's just. Beauty and not beauty. Or. Every. Everyone's aesthetic. Different. Caused. Is. The choice. And the choice. This problem. But. In fact. There are some things. Is. Need you to. Express. For example. Its function. Its material. Right. Various. Its service. This is. Is. Need you to. Describe it. And then. You need to. Add this. The text. In the text. To write more. But. Like me. This kind of. Of words. Actually. Because. Its picture. The quality. Requirements. Is. Bigger than. The quality. Required. So. I. Mainly. Is. The picture. The main. Mainly. Is. The picture. The main. You can also. Choose. The picture. As the main. But. I. Suggest. You. Don't. Be lazy. You. Can. Add. Some. Text. Why. Is. After. I. Said. So. Much. After. I. Still. Suggest. You. Do. Text. Because. This. Is. In. A. A. A. Search. Search. Search. Flow. What. Search. Flow. Key. Key. Key. Key. Key. Key. Key. Key. Key. Key. Key. Key. Search. Search. Search. Search. Search. Search. Search. Search. Selic. Search. Search. Search. Search. Search. Search. Search. easy for others to search for some keywords then this time right when others search can come out so the case is also others to search to identify a system provides a this core point understand and then of course except the case topic is also topic is also this will teach you how to do it well I simply say here topic words you can go to bring some like you can go to reference if you will not go to bring the topic will not go to bring the topic directly to reference others directly to reference you can look at my my basically is to use the image as the core and then to spread to spread the image as the core for example female image micro-channel image quality image small photo image and then animation image cartoon image you will find my keywords is this right and then you can also is to expand on this basis to expand good release time my release time is between 11 o'clock at noon to 11 o'clock at night will be released if you say the day want to release the day will be at 11 o'clock at noon to 11 o'clock at night to 11 o'clock at night between 5 o'clock to 8 o'clock can go to send and then there are also 10 o'clock at night can also be sent I tested before at 10 o'clock at night it is also a wave of traffic is also a wave of traffic so you can also go to choose to release at 10 o'clock at night ah these three time points can be sent three time points can be sent understand to remember to remember and then emphasize double-day and holiday to send more easy to report I tell you my first report of the report the first day is April 30 30 I also reported before April 30 ah is that kind of small report understand small report is what means is about a few hundred dollars a day and then really start to sign is a day of profit and loss sign is from May 1 ah is from May 1 understand is basically from April 30 ah May 1 ah is also when you are on vacation that stage I am the most reported stage ah I am the most reported stage ah and then basically one day is the case is to sign ah sign ah so must be in the holiday more ah must be in the holiday I tell him a little more you must be that is there are many students a problem what problem is that there is no flow right is very anxious teacher I sent a note only 50 100 small eyes I am too anxious I am too anxious I tell you do not worry why do not worry Xiaomeng said he has a delay a delay do you know what is the delay Xiaomeng's notes for example you just started there are many people will say Teacher I have no traffic anyway seven days ago why do I post so much ah you have to know it's not like that once you report once you report he won't say he will only report you he is not like Douyin ah like watermelon video you if you post this Douyin watermelon video you will know your note no not note you show your video you post it tonight can he report actually it is tonight right Xiaomeng said not to eat is not like this Xiaomeng said for example you posted before right you posted before at that time your account is not high and then this note is not reported he may only have a few hundred small eyes but as long as his content is good he will report it later understand I will tell him like this I can share with you an example OK I did one before well simply put I used to do an IP account of a doctor for a doctor and then I did such an account before this account I did one at that time ah a hot spot a hot spot I am I remember I was within ten notes within ten notes help this doctor's account directly break 20,000 points ah directly break 20,000 points just ten notes break 20,000 points ah I don't know what you think what do you think anyway because of him how to say this he belongs to the hammer type is very hammered right hammered belongs to the hammered very small heavy field right and then in the small mushroom belongs to the hammered very hammered very heavy this kind of small field small heavy field and then ten notes directly break break to 20,000 just ten notes directly break 20,000 and then ten notes in fact not the tenth report but the first few but the first few when I just started he didn't have any big reports then I actually took the hot spot ah at that time it was taken by the top ten this is called ah what is it just acting the actress who played the mermaid ah this star female star Lin Yun ah Lin Yun was published at the time a note and then said he used Mino Dildin ah is to evaluate the hair such a a note and then I took that note and then took it ah this Lin Yun's note and then made a video after making a video there was no report at the time ah there was no report at the time and then a week later big report ah a week later directly report and then directly from hundreds of fans directly to 20,000 fans ah directly to 20,000 fans ah this is ah I did it last year ah last year the second half of the year is about last year November December such a note so I'll tell you just say say this case this case is to tell you don't feel you now the note no traffic you feel give up or say anxiety or say I'm not doing it or say I hide it ah no it has a long delay flow long flow understand good and then this is a note of the little red book six elements ah I mainly talk about the above notes because we mainly for the transformation right ah how to check no is there any sensitive I said before you go to see that the first-hand handbook first-hand handbook ah in the actual combat tool bag you do you have is it must be to see the first-hand handbook ah I always update you good first-hand handbook inside the actual combat tool bag inside right will give you update some of the tools of the little red book sensitive words how to check there is a there is a good good so next talk about the topic AI to do the topic this is actually very simple this I ask this student is there ah use use our that mirror website have not used have not used the mirror website if there is to use students you should know that it is a know right there is a is a lot of people in addition to learning this ah training outside right you should still have to learn that our system class it is not to learn ah we go to learn system class ah system class where to come system class of the course I do not say more ah I because I have some repeated content I do not say this is our seven-day card game class it that in addition to the seven-day card game class in addition to students you actually also the course of the smart actual combat camp right ah in addition to the seven-day card game class you still have ah the course of the actual battle camp ah this is the launch ah not this ah wrong which one ah um yes this ah good take a look and then in that course of the actual battle camp you look at the course list ah wait a minute this course do not not look also go to see do not go to see ah is in the school base navigation ah not the course of the class ah ah ah ah ah here ah so oh stuck good you look at in this course we actually have taught students how to use AI to do text processing technology ah and then to do this image processing technology and video processing technology ah right and then in the course in fact we are is taught students how to use gpt have used to ask ah have to use gpt except gpt and then there is ah we are provided with the this mirror website ah have students used ah used the public to deduct one ah used the students public to deduct one good and then here in fact is have taught students how is it is these classes to look at good because I do not want to just repeat waste time good and then here is the fourth chapter of the fourth chapter if you do not go to see students tomorrow to see is how to use gpt to generate the topic to find the topic to copy the newspaper this course is all I let the three-way road to record very detailed how to use gpt to make a picture ah but I'm not saying just for small red book all the self-media platform can be done right like the number of hundred plus right like what ah this headline number right and like the call question headline question headline hundred plus right hundred not hundred plus hundred degree know right that these platforms can be done and then I will probably give you a talk about the production of video scripts and then this self-media selection question and self-media title optimization and involved is how to use AI to copy the newspaper how to use AI to find the topic this has and because it is live I actually now want to give you the scene to practice this gpt how to use but I can not practice if practice may be blocked live everyone consider it good if now directly to you practice directly in fact I open you if you see see me in front in fact is but I can not go to practice ah can not let you practice and then in these courses have understand to look at the students do not lazy to go to see good and then the little red book is the same little red book is the same ah well I come back to my course again back to our course ah well then above is to say is to use AI to do the topic with AI to write a case ah understand with AI to do the topic with AI to do the case has not used the habit and then not good ah this course where to go if this course where to go you do not know now can go to ask the teacher ah you have not seen this course class this class ah from to to the first six chapters have been updated ah pay attention to the first six chapters have been updated understand is the main line of learning the first six chapters have been updated is AI text processing technology AI image processing technology AI video processing technology all use all finished all finished did not see the class to see good there is a class is already seen right did not see to see and then follow up follow up do not do not is how to say do not just look at it once is past to try it yourself OK and then especially combined like us ah combined like us now this little red book is all universal understand some are universal you like text processing image processing video processing these are actually universal actually universal and then tell him is like this part is actually repeated tell him this part is basically repeated and then brought out is the AI this this painting of the middle of the this is with our with the current we training camp is that everyone this in the training camp this second day the third day of the class is repeated so you can see can not see can see can not see and then like what we are also looking for teachers to record but still recording after recording can also be synchronized updated to everyone and this side this side has not finished this side has not finished but then the pot in next week these two are able to finish next week are able to finish so you guys can finish it in the next week so you guys can also take a look it's about how to generate this PPT with this AI I won't say this this is actually for us little red book is not very helpful but you can go and have a look you can take a look and then this place is helpful this position is helpful is how to use AI to do some what video and then some things related to the media because the little red book also belongs to the media field and then you will finish this I should be in next week next week one or two if I should I have time I will go up for you go up and then you go and have a look and then this position is also followed these are all followed take a look if you haven't seen anything will not cut the video will not cut the video take a look and then say again if you have a classmate have GPT can use GPT if not because now GPT registration is relatively limited in China if there is no GPT continue to use our mirror website mirror website this is the same as our mirror mirror GPT our mirror may be more suitable for newbies to use a little if you go to use GPT yourself you need to teach him I'll show you one let you see a text take a look if not you can see this case OK is the GPT training process I am here with this little red book as an example you take a look first you have to tell him a status I want you to play this note this training is that you have to let GPT is to give him a job you want him to have a status you say I want you to play the blogger of the little red book I will provide some case data this is for information to help you learn to help you become an excellent little red book blogger and then the second step is that I provide cases he disassembled analysis model the third step feedback and application and then this is the case you simply take a look if there is a useful classmate to use if there is no useful classmate directly use our mirror website for example look here please write a book about card notes writing methods small red book notes require the summary of the paper to match the text above this thing you don't know how to do to open that or I just told you this is not no is in this position the fourth chapter this 15 15 in the fourth chapter to see the fourth chapter 15 to see and then after looking to look at this is the previous 123 previous 123 is the section for information is the section for super-reporting for information with our 15 is the same you go and have a look and then this position is for example for example, the above one is always said to be the same the above one is always said to be the same so we can let him according to his own summary style template he will summarize the template himself what to say simply is for example you go to the small red book you go to find some newspaper right after the newspaper you take his file how to pull how to pull how to pull do you know the text of the small red book note do you know simply mirror gpt it is actually almost you can also teach him you can also teach him and then I'll tell you that is how to copy the small red book note because you know if you directly open it through your mobile phone right you can not copy right can not copy the note right how to do I teach you a way the first way you can directly share to your WeChat inside through the computer end WeChat computer WeChat client end to open and then you will find you will be surprised to find you can copy the detailright do a two- erm I can't practice now because my phone is not connected to my computer I'll explain it to you on WeChat First, listen to the first step First, the first step is to say the red book on your phone Then you find the copy When you find the copy, the text is not repeatable Do you understand this logic? Do you understand this? Understand? Step by step First of all, it is not possible to copy a copy of a copy on your phone Right? How to do it? You choose the share button in the upper right corner of this note Then share the link to WeChat Who do you give it to? You can give it to yourself File transmission is also fine You can give it to your family That is to say You share it with your family Share it with your family Share it with your family You can share it on WeChat Understand? Share to WeChat Who do you share it with? After sharing WeChat You use the computer to log in WeChat Then click on the link you share directly at this time Click on the link you share to open At this time, you will be surprised to find that it can be copied Its text is copyable This is the easiest way This is the easiest way to do it Understand? Come to understand the code This is already very simple This is already the easiest way Understand the code Understand the code Understand? This is the easiest way Okay What is another way? You can pass If you don't want to transfer the computer Trouble, right? You just want to talk about your phone All processes are operated on your phone No computer We don't want to pass the computer Then you use the light shake program Understand? This is understood Understand code 1 In your phone inside the phone Find the light shake program in the program It can directly extract the text Understand? Understand code 1 Understand code 1 These two ways are easy to use These two ways are easy to use In fact, there are many other ways besides this way I just think it's easier to use It's easier to use These two ways are okay This is I think it's easier Because I use my phone often I must use my phone and computer But why do I recommend light shake program? Because I found that some people will tell me that I don't need a computer I just use my phone Then you use the light shake program to extract But you have to watch the ads Understand?

look at someone's newspaper This newspaper I want to say This newspaper This newspaper This newspaper This newspaper The students Nemo this newspaper Our newspapersóbout Wen The Under these Neighbors Develop Wait all here 都比你本身的点赞要高 像这种它就是金句啊 就可以用的 然后数据模板 可以在广告产品的数据模板中查看 这个就是借助一些 第三方工具网站 这个我在那个 实战工具包里面也有更新啊 也有更新啊 但这个对于新手来说 可用可不用啊 对于新手来说 可用可不用 包括对于我来说 我都可用可不用 因为用的比较少 就是用借助第三方工具嘛 比方说新红 对吧 比方说新红 然后你们也可以去用 然后还可以用一些 我这里不过多推荐 在那个我们实战工具包里面有 你们可以去看一下 好吧 好 那么选题库啊 选题库的话 就是各位同学要学会去搭建自己的选题库 那么搭建选题库的前提是 你每天要去看你的对标账号 至少一个小时 这是我们的建议啊 这是我的建议 那每天抽一个小时的时间去观察 模仿学习你的对标账号 然后你就可以去看 那怎么做呢 怎么做 然后总共有三点 第一点是 扒对标账号的爆款内容 当你对各种 你们看一下 当你对各种对标账号越看越熟悉之后 接下来的第一步啊 就是要开始去扒对标账号的爆款内容 那爆款一般来说 我们建议是先模仿 再超越 再优化 啊 在就是先以模仿为主 不要想着说自己去创造爆款 爆款 先模仿 先去以模仿为主啊 别人爆过的东西 他一定是有再爆的这个趋势的 是可以再爆的 明白吗 我我就发现很多人超我 真的太 你们如果最近有观察 我发现平台里面超我的人太多了 但我都被超习惯了 超麻木了 你知道吗 所以你们要知道 有些东西爆的时候可以再爆 但我不是让你们超我 再同学啊 说这个话说出来 不让你们超我啊 只是我跟你们说 除了比方说说我以外 还有很多其他的一些 对标账号 他们做得很好 嗯 对吧 可以直接先模仿 后超越 再优化 明白吗 这我就不多说了 然后呢 呃 主要拆解模型是这里 看一下 然后账账号的名称 爆款的封面 爆款的笔记图 然后文案的内容 还有爆款的链接 就是也就是说 比方你建个一个表格 建个表格 表格里面拆解 就是写第一个 第一项是账号名称 第二项 报爆款的封面 封面的封面 封面的封面 是要抄的啊 封面是核心的 然后爆款的笔记图 还有文案的内容 爆款的链接 按照这个模式模板 去进行拆解啊 去进行拆解 然后呢 这里是一些工具 这我刚给你们说到的 这个八视频的文案工具 把清头小程序 这是我刚给你们说过的 你也可以再用啊 再可以再用 这我给你们说的 就选文案提取 然后把链接复制进来 然后就可以提取文案了 这个说过了 然后八笔记图的工具 是功夫去水应用啊 功夫去水应 就是别人的图片 你想用的 你可以直接复制进来 然后它不是 如果你直接保存 不是有水应吗 对不对 那你可以直接通过 功夫去水应 然后把它扒出来 把它扒出来啊 但是我再说一下啊 作为我的学员 不要去扒我的 好不好 我们能不能达成这个共识 大家多去模仿别人啊 不要去直接扒我的 我把这些技能技巧 就是交给同学们 不是让你们直接去扒我的 因为我看到有人 太多人 扒我的了 我既然愿意分享 我就不建议 就是就是不建议同学们 去以我作为对标 但是我想说的是 如果太多人 比方说我的学员很多 对吧 如果所有学员都去 就是直接去扒我的话 就会导致什么呢 没用了 不是我不让你们扒 而是就会出现一个问题 就是重复率太高 明白吗 所以你们就不要 就是以我为对标可以 但是不要就是直接扒 明白吗 所以同学明白 明白可以 明白可以 好不好 我这是也是给你们的 算是给你们的一个 这个怎么说呢 给你们一个建议 因为他也是平台也是会 会去考虑到重复率的问题 明白吧 因为一旦同志的话 内容过高 重复率过高 他反而就没用了 反正没用了 所以对你们来说也是好 如果所有同学都同样的去扒 就没有用了 懂吧 好 然后呢 这样的方式 大概去整理100条内容 然后就没用了 就有100条火锅的选题库 这是我刚刚说的建议选题的方式 然后同样的 注意一下 不是让你直接去抄别人文案 而是说从一个新的角度去再写 那你能说不会 不会的话怎么办 GPT可以再写呀 对不对 我刚刚说过了 就是要去学 我们刚刚给大家说到的 这里面的课程 这里这个第四章的课程 一定要去学 因为你要知道 很多时候你不会去写的时候 除了用你的Junior 去辅助你以外 对吧 我刚刚也说到了 GPT 它也可以帮你完成很多事情 帮你完成很多事情 然后呢 继续说第二点呢 就是去全平台去挖掘素材 去填充你的这个脚本库 然后我们刚刚说到 就是你不仅要在小红书平台 去抄你的对标账号 对吧 你也可以在全平台去找素材 比方说抖音啊 快手啊 知乎啊 微博啊 公共号都可以啊 都可以 你可以在这些平台上面 直接把别人 抱过的 内容的脚本 可以直接扒下来用 但是我跟你们说一下 抖音呢 快手啊 和小红书啊 它肯定是有一些 就是区别 就你会发现 同样的 是做同样账号 抖音和小红书 写用户的偏好 它是不一样的 它一定是不一样的 抖音上 它容易火什么呢 就是那种美女 就是那种美女 就是那种怎么说 比方说你们可以看一下 我的小红书笔记 往前 前面的几篇内容 就那种身材 爆好的美女 明白吗 然后还有那种现象级的 就是场面非常辉煌的 这种壁纸 我跟你们说 这种去做抖音 去做抖音 一定 你们也不一定非做 只做小红书 同步做抖音 开始都可以 但是抖音用户 和小红书用户的 用户偏好 是不一样的 明白吗 然后像小红书上 它可能像我 大众比较喜欢的 就是那种真人 你人可爱 头像 就是说 说白了就是女孩子喜欢的 但你 你如果说 你去抖音上 你感觉为何抖音上 会更加偏好 你觉得 就是美女 说白了就是美女 明白吧 懂我意思吗 说的比较含蓄 但你们应该懂 然后呢 这个是 你可以去夹品来扒 但是一定在这个扒的前提之上 要搞清楚一个问题 优先于第一点 但这一点呢 我是跟你们说 也可以去扒 但是一定要考虑到 平台调性的一个问题 你会发现 你如果把抖音的东西 完全一比一的去扒 到小公司上 没用 他不报 但并不是说 一定不报 不是的 你可能会出现 你两天要是报的 明白吧 我这里面给你简单说一下 就不多说了 第三点的话 就是结合热点 这我也不多说了 其实热点就等于流量 流量就等于客户 客户就等于变现 就这么简单 这是我给他说的 这样的一个 抖音的没那么正经 这小公司相对来说 比较偏正经一点 你可以这么去理解 然后呢 热点等于流量 一定要学会怎么去扒热点 我刚刚给你们去讲了 几个扒热点的方式 一二三四五六 六个扒热点的方式 就是热点关键词的方式 这六个是核心 是关键 所以这六个一定要去用 一定要去用 然后没办法去演练 但是你们可以自己 就是去试试就知道了 然后呢 然后呢 去哪了 然后去哪了 我的内容 然后这个是以上内容 我们就说到这里 有进程 结束啊 选题库我也就说到这里了啊 就是结合热点 这我都说了 这个很简单 然后呢 如何找对标 其实你们已经找到了 但我简单再说一下 就找到对标之后 怎么去拆解对标啊 怎么去拆解对标 拆解对标的话 然后首先你要去对标账号 你们不是找了五个对标账号吗 你找到对标账号 就是你的学习对象 但是你们在做的过程中 你们其实慢慢的会发现 你的对标账号会有些偏移 明白吧 就是你会发现 因为有的人他并不是说 怎么说呢 立马就确定了自己的方向 对吧 你会在做的过程中 去找到自己的方向 明白吗 就比方说原本 我可能想去对标 比方说假设啊 你们一开始想对标我的 但是做了做了 你会发现 好像你发生了一些 你自己的方向 然后我可能更加倾向于 比方说萌宠的头像 我更加倾向于情侣头像 对吧 你会发生一些偏移 所以你们的对标账号 其实不是一成不变的 而是你会发现 你们现在是五个对标账号 对吧 我不是说只为了完成作业 找五个对标账号就不找了 你们其实后面 是会发生偏移的 这个时候你会去 怎么说呢 补充你的对标账号 那你把你的对标账号 补充之后 这个对标账号 它就是你的学习对象 明白吗 就是你的学习对象 那么拆解的话 我们一般是怎么拆 首先第一个 看一下分析维度啊 分析内容的维度 我们一般分析对标账号 的维度 它的内容的维度 就是六个维度 价值感 确定性 独家感 多样性 普世性 和讨喜度 这几点 好 然后大家看一下 我最近 我最近在画一些 给你们看一下 我不知道你们 像这种我就没有发小红书 你知道为什么没发吗 这种我就没发小红书 因为这种小红书 是肯定不给过的啊 你们能看出来 我画的是谁吗 同学们 这个你们能看出来 画的是谁吗 这个我没发 没发小红书 因为不敢发 不敢发 其实你们看到 你们看到我发的 其实一部分 有一部分是没发的 那这个给你们说一下 对 马尼莲梦露 这张画的是马尼莲梦露 但是我给你们说一下 有很多是不能发 很多是不能发 所以我想跟你们说的就是 就是 要去看别人东西 我的软件又出来了 突然就想给你们看一下这个 我也不知道为啥 但因为突然想到 就是 给你们举例子 哪一些是不能发 你们说一下 包括我给你们透露一点 像我之前 我之前在做那个 我记得我之前做过一篇笔记 就很早之前 去年的时候 做一篇笔记 然后呢 当时笔记的封面 用了蜡笔小新的那个表情包 就蜡笔小新 撅着屁股的表情包 知道吧 你们应该都看过 那个表情包的啊 然后呢 那个是直接 就是不给我过 就是直接信了 不给我过 为什么呢 因为小红书平台 它可能是 考虑到 就是因为它的用户群里 主打的是女性 明白吧 所以有一些擦边的东西 其实是不给过的 不给过的 如果你们用 米德朱尼去绘画图的话 你们也会发现 米德朱尼它里面 有一些敏感词 它其实也是不给过的 比方说什么吊带背心啊 就有一些偏向于擦边的啊 其实系统都是比较敏感的 所以建议大家就是 怎么说呢 就是像这类型的内容 可以把它 比较敏感的 避免掉 可以把它避免掉 好 然后分析内容的六个维度看一下 第一个是价值感 其实就是定位 然后这个人是讲什么东西的 这个人他是干什么的 他能提供用户 什么样的一个价值 就是价值感 就是你去分析它 明白吧 就是比方说 你像我的这个账号 你蒙混一下 我这个账号的价值感是什么 我分析下来 我这个账号 它其实主要就是提供头像的 这个就是价值 因为很多数 特别是女性群体 对于自己的 自己的头像是有很有需求的 有的人可能一个礼拜换个头像 有的人可能一个礼拜换很多头像 然后呢 很多人就希望 因为现在 就是你们可能 我不知道你们有没有这个感觉 就是很多人他们有这种感觉 就是他不喜欢用真人头像 就不喜欢用别人的 网络的真人头像 对吧 然后他就想说卡通头像 但卡通头像又不那么特别 所以有的人就想用卡通的自己的头像 所以这个就是我当时想到 我为什么做这个账号 因为我 我自己 有这个感觉 包括我身边的人也有这个感觉 就是你们在用 就是在用 在用微信头像的时候 包括在去做其他头像的时候 他在选头像的时候 他既不想用真人的 也不想用那种很卡通的 萌宠的 对吧 那种猫啊狗啊 也用多了 然后这时候很多人就需求 他的需求就是 想用自己的卡通头像 所以的话 这就是我的价值 就是我的账号所带来的价值 然后确定性啊 就属于运营的一个 确定性啊 层面了 这个你们先看一下就行了 这就是确定 就是运营的一个确定性 然后独家感 独家感的话 这个怎么说呢 就是内容的独家 就比方说独一无二的内容 当然很难做到 你比方说像 但是有一点是可以做到的 密的纠念它有一点是可以 就是能够辅助我们去完成这一点的 因为每个人在画图的时候 有人发现 每个人用的关键词是不一样的 所以它是有一定的独家性的 有一定的独家性的 对吧 然后呢 多样性 多样性的话 就是素材多元 这个我也简单说 因为这个对于我们这种来说 其实怎么说 帮助不是很大 因为我们 但是还是要关注到的 比方说这个多样性设计到比方说 大家都是头像 但是有的人是这个头像 有的人是那种头像 有的人是这个风格 也是那个风格 这个就是你要去看一下 还有的你会发现 有的人在做的时候 他会多种 多种风格去做 对吧 你也可以去尝试 像我的话 我比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 比较 然后呢 你们也可以比方说 多种风格的这个层次去做 明白吗 普世性 就是覆盖人群 你像我的覆盖人群 就是所有人 所有人 对吧 没有 没有 就是具体到谁谁谁 但是如果你要具体一点的话 那其实更多是女性 因为男性对于头像的需求 不是很大 然后讨喜度 就是 就是一个讨喜的 其实我觉得 我们这种其实比较讨喜的 因为卡通的头像嘛 它本身就比较讨喜 比较容易戳中 用户的某一个情感的需求点 所以这个其实挺好的 明白吗 这也是我当时就是说 为什么会选择 做这个账号的原因 内容张分的本质呢 其实用户点赞 当前内容满足 用户关注 的话就是关注未来的 内容的一个预期 这个你们看一下 然后提升用户关注的 一个几率 就是价值感 价值感 然后确定性和独家感 然后提升 提升账号 关注的一个上限的话 就是后面的多样性 普世性和讨喜度 这个你们简单看看就可以了 这个这一块 主要是让你们 有一个概念的理解 就是怎么说呢 有个概念的理解 是有助于你去做这个运营的 好 然后接下来说 接下来就是内容可复制的套路 文案啊 服装啊 这都可以复制 化妆啊 场景啊 道具光效音效特效 这都可以复制 明白吗 然后运营当中可复制的 名字 简介 背景图 封面 互动 推送 变现 引流 这都可复制 这些是都可复制的 明白吗 有一些是不可复制 但这些所谓都是可以复制 明白吗 白色同学可以截图啊 可以截图啊 这些说白了 然后当你在去拆解对标账号 一定程度之后呢 你其实慢慢的这个过程当中 会形成自己的风格 形成自己的运营思路 懂吧 然后呢 去构建自己的体系 内化于心 所以很多同学会说 上来就让我抄 其实不是 在这个过程里面 你去 我们这个抄是打双引号的 在这个过程里面 你其实也是对于自己的网感 对于自己这个做 什么 小猪笔记 去运营小猪笔记的一个手感 也是有所提升的 好明白吧 好那么下楼就多说了 然后涉及到标题啊 封面啊 这个我们下一节直播课在讲 然后今天这些直播呢 主要还是给大家去讲 就是选题怎么去写 然后文案怎么通过 把GPT去写 明白吗 包括怎么去 去借鉴对标账号 然后对标账号一定要利用好 很多同学对标账号就看就不看了 我的要求是 每天花 一个小时以上时间去看对标账号 我这么忙我都看 你们不要不看 知道吗 我这么忙的情况下 我每天都花一个小时去看 你们如果不看 你们一定会被抛弃掉的 就一定会被这个板块去抛弃掉的 不要羡慕到自己的思维 自己的模式里面去 不要闭门造车 一定要什么 去把眼光打开 把格局打开 多去看对标账号 每天花一个小时以上时间 大家能不能做到 来能做到扣一啊 能做到扣一 能做到扣一 能做到扣一 然后所有同学 今天这节课听完之后呢 包括前面两节作业完成之后呢 接下来的主要任务 就是要求大家去发笔记 每天至少两篇以上 如果你希望更快出效果 发到五篇以上啊 发到五篇以上 五到十篇 五到十篇 去给自己定义目标 去给自己 如果你们希望自己能做出成果的 不是把这个 只是单纯拿来试一试 做着玩的 那么我希望大家 大家能够做到成果 就是说上点心 好吧 逼着自己去做 你做下来之后 你做个七天十天 你就会有结果 明白吧 我也非常期待所有同学有结果 我也不希望说 七天完了之后 有同学说老师 我作业还没完成呢 老师 我这个还没有出效果呢 我不希望听到这样的结果 我希望是我所带的所有学员 都能出效果 好不好 然后去 怎么说 自己要有学习主动的 主动的这样的一个能力 好吧 我是 我记得有几个学员 我印象特别深 你们知道为什么印象深吗 是因为他们的学习主动性挺强的 你比方说李永昌 对吧 孙先生 眼光66我也 我也是有印象的 好 那么一定要去提升自己学习主动力 好吧 然后作业一定按时提交 好 其他的我都说了 我们今天这节直播课内容就到这里结束了 我们下节直播再跟大家去分享 没有 没有什么所谓最笨的 没有 有一句话还叫笨鸟先飞 对吧 其实没有 哎呦 马上把手机砸了 没有这个说法 你要就是勤快 勤能补拙 勤能补拙 明白吧 然后呢 多去看 多去学 多去模仿 多去练 它就一定能出效果 好吧 不难呀 这怎么难 我跟你们说的这些呢 是结合了 怎么说呢 结合了原理去说的 你抛去原理 去实操 其实很简单 其实非常简单 明白吧 好 那本节直播内容就到此结束 大家还有问题的话 我们就后续再聊啊 也可以在 大家的一个服务群里面去聊 好吧 拜拜",

    "data": " I've been putting makeup on other people for many years and now I want to try something different I'll talk Hannah here through taking her makeup from day to night just like you might do at home so the first thing you do at the end of the day when it's time to go from day to night you've had your makeup on I don't suggest you should wash it off but you do have to touch it up so Hannah first thing is check your mirror and let me know what you think do you need more concealer more foundation you tell me I do You do. Just a touch. Okay. Not loads, but a little. Okay. I sometimes put moisturizer at the end of the day to kind of fluff me up, but I don't know what you do. You use your fingers? Always. So go ahead. Okay, that looks... Just a refresh? Yeah, it's a refresh. It looks a little light. Then a little base. Okay. And then you want to maybe just not over-redo your base, but just put it on, which is foundation. In the UK, they call it base. Here we call it foundation. Especially around the nose is where people, at the end of the day, the redness comes around the mouth. And you could touch your forehead a little bit, too. Okay. I don't think women realize that you have to redo your foundation, and you're not going to get it done. your concealer in the evening, but it does make a big difference, especially if you're using darker shadows on your eyes. Okay, pretty good? Yeah. All right, let's do your eyes first. Let's do a like a shimmery, smoky eye. Love that. Okay, let's start with the pencil. This is great because you could line your eye and then smudge it, and it's really easy. And not everyone has the luxury to be able to go back home and redo your makeup. Sometimes you're at your desk in New York City. Sometimes you're in the back of a taxi. So pretty good. You can even go a little bit more. And that just creates the depth. And it's great that you're just using your fingers and you don't have to carry around brushes. Yeah, that's great. That's great. Okay. Fingers are the best way to blend. And by the way, good light is everything. And so make sure that you hold your mirror up to good light. Look up. It's not flattering when you look down, and it's hard to see, but definitely look up. All right, now let's go sparkly. Your finger or a brush. It's up to you. Finger. Excellent. Yep, I would take it three-quarters. Okay. And then I would add more. I think for nighttime, the light is darker. More is better. Oh, I love this. Yeah, it's really pretty. It's very gold flecked. Yeah, and that's beautiful. Okay. Do the other eye. Okay. It's kept the same size. And then you can add more and put a little more of it in. Okay. And then I'm going to blend it in. I'm going to blend it in. I'm going to blend it in. Okay. Blend it in. And I think you got more on this eye, which I like, so I'll go back and put more on the other eye. Yeah, a little bit more on the first eye. It's always easier to add more than to take away, but that's really nice. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now sometimes you could also do a very soft smudgy line underneath, like close to the lashes where it's kind of a quick, soft, smokey eye. Okay. That looks beautiful. Now, some people that's their day makeup, some people that's their night. I think you could really take it up a notch with black. You could either use a gel or a pencil. What's your preference? 3D gel? Sure. Okay, now start close to the lash line. Start at the inside, go out, or the middle, and go either way. And you've got the... most amazing eyes that you could go thin or you can go strong. And I think you can get away with a little bit of a stronger one. You can, if you choose, you could bring it out a bit, make a little bit of a cat eye. Should we smudge it? You could smudge it. I like to smudge it, and then I like to go back and add more. So smudge it first. Excellent. And then add a little bit more underneath. Gorge. Okay, do the other. But see for you guys at home that are watching, that blue eyes and a black smudgy liner looks really good. It brings the color out of the eye, as does the gold shimmer. I also... really love people with green eyes using a color that's a little bit of a slate smudged. And for some people with green eyes, a very soft muted violet is really gorgeous. Brown eyes can be so beautiful when the brown eye sticks out. When you have a lot of color on the lid, sometimes you don't notice the brown eyes. So different tones of browns paired with some black liner, to me, is the greatest thing for brown eyes. I like to go with a little bit of a white. Okay, awesome. Yeah, make sure it's all smudged. Make sure both eyes are the same. Looks gorge. Now, mascara. I would add a couple more, since you put mascara on for the day look. Let's put a couple more coats. Be really careful that it doesn't clump. And then let's re-curl it afterwards. Awesome. So I have a couple more coats of mascara on my eye. I'm going to do a little bit of a smudge. I'm going to go ahead and smudge it. I'm going to go ahead and smudge it. So I'm going to go ahead and smudge it. I'm going to go ahead and smudge it. I'm going to go ahead and smudge it. I'm going to go ahead and smudge it. I'm going to go ahead and smudge it. I know a lot of girls have individual lashes these days, but I think you can get the same look with mascara. Awesome. Yes, always. Because you know when you like to mascara, you're cheap. Always, always have a cotton swab near by so you could fix any kind of mascara that smudges. And since you've already done your brows for your day look, I do not see a reason to make them darker. I don't like dark brows, especially with the smoky eye. And it's up to you. Mascara on the bottom, it definitely makes your mascara stand out. I also like to offer a spoolie, which is basically a mascara wand without any kind of product on it, just to kind of comb them through. Yeah, there's just comb these guys a little bit. Yeah. And your lashes are quite curly, but you can always at home, just go up and gently push them up if you need to. Okay. Now, you had a little bit of blush on the morning. I don't know how much more you need, but maybe a little bit of highlight. Do you think, do you like more blush on yourself? Maybe just a touch. Okay. Bit of a kind of a neutral tone. Okay. You could choose from these. These are colors that you could put on your cheeks or your lips, but let's just do your cheek first. Yeah, kind of like a pinky beige. Make sure not to go too close. Yep. Really good. Now, I love the light lip. You probably could get away with red. Do you ever wear red or you prefer light? I do love red. I think I'm going to ask you to do red, because I think that'll be really pretty. What kind of red do you like? How bright? I love all red actually. You do? Okay. Let me find some good reds. I'm going to give you some choices. Yeah. So there is really red. There's a little bit of a pinker red. There's a super red red. So should we do this one? Yeah, do that one. So start at the lower lip. Oh, yeah, that's beautiful. And not everyone can get away with that red lip color. You happen to look great in it. Are you a makeup girl? I am. Very much so. Now, I would do the same makeup for evening for me, but I would not do the red lip because I don't look good in a red lip. Or as you say, I don't fancy a red lip. It's not about what shape your lip is. It's not about the color of your skin. Some people just don't love it. You're either a red lipstick person or you're not. I am not. Yep. Cotton swab or finger. Let me see. Just open your mouth for a minute. Pretty good. You look gorge. What do you think about a little something high on the cheek? I'd love that. Okay. The pinky one goes with her skin. If she had... If she had done the bronze, it would have looked dirty and the light might have looked pasty. These are advanced techniques. They take practice. If it doesn't look okay, don't worry. That's what makeup remover is for. Voila. Gorge. And that's how you rock a day-to-nighttime look. Just a few things is all you need and you're ready for day-to-night. Throw on a pair of big earrings or sparkly earrings and you got this. You got this.",

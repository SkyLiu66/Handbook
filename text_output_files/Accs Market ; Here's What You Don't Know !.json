    "data": " So about a year ago I made a video talking about how to buy channels from ACCS market and there were a few interests with regards to the video that I posted. There were a couple of comments that came from different angles, different countries, different people. So today I'm just going to make another video, probably like more of answering the questions that you guys were asking and also do some more real tests. This is the video and I think the video is now a year ago and currently as it stands the video got 4.3k views on it which is really not bad considering that I mean the other videos that I have and the type of views, the average views that they got. So I've tried my impossible best to answer majority of the questions that came in. Some of them were too technical and I couldn't actually type them so I felt it's actually best I showcase it in a video. The first comment that actually came out was from Benjamin and he said Great video brother, just subscribe. Is it possible for you to do a follow up video on what happens after you have purchased the channel? And the process involved in switching from the seller at CERNs to the new owner at CERNs and the long waiting period. Okay so this is something that I actually went through when I actually bought my channel as well and I think it's a common thing. As long as you're buying, a channel which is not obviously yours, you will have to do a few changes like the AdSense, change the account. Otherwise, whatever video that you put on the channel, the money that you make will go to the previous person. So I mean AdSense, you definitely need to change the account information based on the YouTube account that you're buying. So first and first, I mean when you get the YouTube channel, let's say you buy the channel from, I mean ACC market, after the duration, the wait period, of you waiting to become the primary owner of the account. Once you get access to the account, the next thing that you may want to do is to change the AdSense account. And by doing so, I believe you can do that from your system. I mean once you log in into YouTube, there should be an option somewhere. I did mine a long time ago, so I can't really recall. But I think you go to your channel and then you go to, let's see, I think it should be somewhere in settings. I'm really not sure. But let's see. Yeah, it's somewhere in, nope, nope, sorry, sorry about that. It's not there. So you go back and then you go to manage account. Yeah, so manage account. I just remembered. I mean it's been a long time. I bought my channel, the Vim Studios channel, and I've been doing this more than a year now, I guess. So after you come in here, then you go to end. Yeah, end. So end is where you see how to end, how the channel is, and how, I mean the account that is attached to the channel. So down here, you're going to see YouTube Partner Program option with the account ID. And there is an option to click on change. So this is where you change the AdSense account. Once you buy a new YouTube channel. So you click when you buy the channel, the person you're buying from is not going to tell you all this, obviously. So you'll be making videos and be making money to someone. So the next question is, what did you say? When you buy a channel, would you be able to change the name? Yes, of course, you will be able to change the name. But I would say do not change it right away. When you buy it, maybe give it some time, probably three weeks, a month. A month, two, then you can change. I mean, you can definitely do changes to the name. So yeah. The next question is, when I upload my channel for list, there is coming a problem. The gain must be, hey man. Okay, so I don't understand what he said. I honestly don't get his question. Yeah, and I sent him that as well. And the next one says, can you suggest the seller you have worked with, with whom we can work with? And what do you think you can trust? This is going to be a tough one. Because first of all, I can't remember. I don't remember the seller that I bought. It's a long time. I don't remember the seller that I bought from. But trust me, you can do this as long as you follow the right precautions. Once you log in, you see a channel, you refer to the channel, read the description, make sure everything the person is saying, you've gone through it. Make sure the account is active. It's got no warnings. Before you attempt on buying. Try to communicate with escrow. So escrow is like their middleman who will stand in between to make sure like the transactions and everything goes in smoothly. So just make sure you follow the right precautions and you should be good. It shouldn't be tough. All right. So the next one says, good side. I'm a seller there. But the bad thing is some scammer. But the bad thing is some scam buyers who buy and dance after a while claimed man. Okay. So he says, good side. I'm a seller there. But the bad thing is some scam buyers who buy and then after a while claim, the seller took the account or hack it. Okay. So this guy is actually a seller from that website and is actually posting some of the issues that he has encountered. All right. Big apps to you. Man. So I'm Sherif. Is it black? Sherif or who is this one? It says, can you link the channel you bought? And he's saying, how do you know I'm a seller? He's saying, I'm a seller. Okay. So I'm a seller. Can we talk to you? You can talk to me. I'm a seller. Can you talk to me? Can you talk to me? Is this a good thing? Sharif, is it Black Sharif or who is this one? He says, can you link the channel you bought? Okay, I think I should have answered this guy. So the channel I bought is Vim Studios. When I bought it, it had a different name. I really can't remember the name, but it was a gaming name. And I changed the name. I've done a whole lot of changes to it. So when I bought it, it was about a thousand subscribers. Exactly, if not a thousand, one or so. So like just right by a thousand. And I've done a lot to it because I've posted a whole bunch of videos. I've monetized the channel. I've changed the name of the channel. I've gained more subscribers on the channel as well. So it's going well so far. In case you don't have me there, just check it out. The name is Vim Studios. So it's V-H-I-M-S-T-U-D-I-O-S. So he says, I've got three questions, sir. I want to buy a YouTube channel. Is it safe to buy there? Because I saw a lot of bad reviews. Yes, it's safe to buy there. But once again, make sure you follow the necessary precautions. Number two, it says, since you bought a channel from there, is there any problems regarding the account? No, I haven't experienced any problems. But I once bought another account which had a problem. But then remember, there is a middleman, which is escrow. If you assign that person, everything should be fine. And you don't have to go through the back and forth and all that. But 99% of the time, as long as you follow the necessary instructions, you should be good. All right. So the next one says, if I bought the channel, is there any chance they can recover the account? No, no. So once you buy the channel, obviously there's process involved. All right. The person owns the ownership. So once you buy the channel, the person has to transfer the ownership to you, which you get to learn that in the process of buying it. So in the process, the person transfers the ownership. It takes about a week or two. Once you become the primary owner, now you have to delete the previous person of the account. All right. So in YouTube, there's some settings in there. After you buy that account, you have to delete the previous owner access. So once you deleted, the person will no longer have access to the channel. And now you will become the full owner of the account. So the person cannot recover. But then if you do not remove the person, then the person might have some chance. Of doing a few stuff onto the account. So this is how it works. It's like a boss and a PR at an office. Okay. The PR has the access to the boss office. You get me. So if you do not delete the person off the account, he may still be able to do a few things. So once you buy it, the first thing you need to do is to delete an ad and to do this. I think it should be somewhere here. So you go. You go to certain. Okay. Should be somewhere. It's been a while. Okay. So manage permission. Yep. So manage permission. You click manage permission. So I'm so here it is. All right. So my account the primary owner is this which is rim studios. That's me and then I'm the owner. So in here you can delete you can add you can manage you can make someone the money. You can make someone like you can remove this ownership here. So there's a few stuff you can do inside your YouTube account. Once you get the ownership. Okay. Once the person sells the channel to you. Once you get the full ownership and the password and the email then you have to right away change all the stuff Indians audience. Not many have us audience. Yeah, this is something that I also notice as well. So on the platform. What? Most people do is they create the account. They make a few legal stuff like they gained some few legal subscribers. Okay, which would be like real subscribers and then down the line. They add some robots to it. So the person can probably gain like 850 original subscribers and then they can add maybe 300 more robots in order to gain like quick quicker money. Right? So once you get it. Chances of you getting robots on the account. The subscribers is pretty high. Okay, those are actually for like the cheap ones. So if you buy an account for probably $100 150 200, obviously that is to be expected, but it does not have anything because once you get the account remember you'll be starting your own nation all that. So you'll be bringing real people on board. So once you get I mean as soon as you buy in a cheap account, you should know that you have to put a bit of effort in order to make the account big. Do not expect that. Oh this account has 2,000 subscribers. So those 2,000 subscribers will follow you through your Jenny will follow you through whatever niche that you want to create on the platform. Just assume or just take it like the subscribers on the platform. You don't know them like just disregard them just assume I mean focus on you trying to build your whole fan base from scratch. That is what you always need to do. But if you are waiting for like the high-end accounts probably like $500 600. Chances are very slim. I mean most cases the are real channels and most of the subscribers are like huge. Okay. So the next question is for example, if you listen to what they not telling you you would hear that the big big channels 100k 300k can get partner deals if they do not if they are not profitable even if they have strike. I mean there you talking about some real big channels here cause 100k 300k those are big channels and they are definitely not going to be profitable. They are going to be cheap. So yeah, the next question is what happens when you remove the content share by the previous owner? Well, honestly the questions that came from these videos like people really mean business. This are like some serious beneficial questions here. So when you remove let's say you buy a channel and the person previously was posting like cartoon or gaming or maybe car videos and you get now the ownership. And let's say the channel. Has 10 videos right away. Do not delete all the 10 videos because once you delete all the 10 videos the system will notice like there is something happening and they might terminate your account. So you can probably delete maybe seven and leave like two which is the same thing that I did mine came with a bunch of videos for gaming. I deleted some and I left about two. So as times went on I started creating my own videos and I think I created about 10 videos. And then I deleted the one. That he had completely so everything was deleted after I posted more videos do not get the channel and right away delete everything of the channel. That's going to be a problem. Okay, the next one says click big title. Okay, that's fine. And this one says don't buy channel on this site. I bought one six days after good. Yeah, I totally understand. I mean such complaints. All right, this by and so of a CC market. It is the s market. Oh, well. You know, it's that that's what I keep saying. If you don't read the times if you don't really pay attention and go through all this properly you end up being stuck in situation that you end up losing money. All right. So whenever you buy just make sure you go cause mostly they post everything on the channel those okay. This channel has thousand subscribers. It's making this amount this that this that and they sometimes leave the link of the channel. On their platform. So you click on the link you go through the channel read everything go back. Make sure the videos on the channel the comments check if the comments are real or they are robots check the names of the people who are commenting. How many videos are on the channel is really monetized try to see if you see ads playing on like go through all that and make sure I mean you're getting a good deal. Do not just go on you see someone say, okay. Hey, I'm selling a channel. With 3000 K for this amount and then right away you pick know some people even go to the extent of not assigning any agents and if you don't assign an agent it's even worse because if any problem occurs you on your own the next one says I want to buy an account but I'm scared. Who can I trust? Yeah, it's it's it's a win-win. But like I said majority of the time you should be good. It all depends on how much you are willing to buy the channel for and I mean you. Expectations. Okay. So if you got about $300 $400 and you want to buy a channel make sure you go through the necessary just do whatever I said, but I mean if you just need something because you feeling lazy to create one then why not just buy any of them and you should be good. So these are the few comments that came through. I hope I've answered majority of your questions. It took me so long to reply to this video because the way okay, that should be business. It took me. Jeez. So it took me so long to reply to you guys because there were a lot going on left the country started building Studios looking for job like there's a whole lot but now I'm back. I'm active. So thank you very much for coming. If ever you want to check the channel that I bought. I mean, it's vim Studios. Like I said, V H I M S T U D I D I O S. So vim Studios all together. All right. I'll try to see if I'll be able to link some links in the description. I'm not sure. So thank you very much for coming. The name is director of them. If you are new subscribe to this channel as well, and I guess I'll see you in the next one. Stay safe. Peace.",

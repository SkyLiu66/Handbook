I'm going to show you how to do it step by step with different colors and once you learn the basics you could get any look you want. You could do a dark smoky eye, a medium smoky eye, a colorful smoky eye. You have to learn the basics first. I'm going to start with what you should not do. Do not get a dark black shadow on your eye. You should not get a dark black shadow on your eye. You should not get a shadow and put it all over your eye because you're going to look like you've been punched in the face. Smoky eye on the runway is not a smoky eye that you should wear every day and smoky eye from the 60s is different than smoky eye now. The good thing about a smoky eye is really what it is. It's just blended shadows together to create a little bit of a look but instead of doing the blended shadows together I'm going to teach you how you can layer different formulas, different textures to fit your style, your skin color. It really doesn't matter but just know that if you are wearing a smoky eye I highly recommend that you keep the eyes the focus, a pretty face, pretty skin and not dark dark lips because that would be too goth. So a smoky eye is layered. Now whether you use a powdered shadow you can absolutely layer powder with light or light. You can also use a powder shadow. You can absolutely layer powder with light or light. You can also use a powder shadow. You can absolutely layer powder with light or light. This is a great idea if you have a soft skin tone. I'm going to show you how to do this with a smoky eye. You can use a few colors of your favorite light colors. You could use the lightest colors, the gray tones, some browns. You can even do a smoky eye with some pinky nude colors. That's a possibility. You could do a smoky eye matte. You can add some shimmer on top of it. So I'm going to show you how to do a smoky eye that's actually pretty easy. I'm going to start So really the lightest shadow you could find if you have Molly's skin color. If you have darker skin, you need to do a color that will probably have a little more yellow in it, but it has to be right because a white shadow will look like makeup from the 60s, and you really want it more modern than that. So you apply the shadow so it pretty much covers any darkness and gets rid of any redness. A lot of women have red eyelids, and this will get rid of the red for the smoky eye. And if you notice, I'm actually putting quite a bit on to cover it. Okay, so that's the first, and you can even take your finger and sometimes if it starts to come through. And by the way, when you use your finger, you get a denser application. And a good tip, you can do the eyes first because then if it falls on the face, it's not a big deal, you can clean around it and then do your foundation and concealer. Now I like when you do smoky eyes to, you could do browns, but I kind of like to use grays because I find that the little bit of the cooler tone is really good for a smoky eye. And I'm adding it to the crease. I'm using the brush to go out a bit. And do you see how easy that was because I didn't have to blend it? Because if I was going to grab the darkest one, it would be really hard. So again, I'm layering it. And this is just a very, very simple medium color shadow. Matte or flat, it's got no shimmer in it. I will add shimmer at the end. And it's blended in the corner. And don't worry if you get some on the inner corner when you're applying it because smoky eye, you get a little bit heavier, but you can have an application. And don't worry because we will clean it up after. I'm going to switch brushes because that brush had a lot of powder on from the first two colors. And a lot of people make mistakes by not switching brushes because by the time you get to the darker color, it's just going to almost be too diffused. So I'm using a clean brush, and I'm going to go to the next deepest color, which is a brown. in the middle, which has less red in it and less black. I'm blowing on it and I expect this to be a little bit dense and that is, it's kind of a shadow, but it's also a line. I'm lifting up the lid, I'm going close to the lashes. Getting a little smudgy and then I start to kind of blend up. It's a combination of diffusing it and blending it. And then you can honestly decide how deep you want it and it's very graduated and not too dense. But you just, you want it and you build it up. It's way easier than blending. I'm also gonna take the brush, look up for a second and smoke out the bottom. And this is something that really depends, look up again, on your choice, but I don't like it too thick underneath. So if it gets on a little bit heavy, you just take a cotton swab, you soften it and you bring it out. So for some people that's way more than they'd even want. For other people, it's not enough. I think it's really modern and beautiful. And I think that Molly could wear that to any party, even if it starts at five o'clock, I think that would be beautiful. So I'm gonna do the other eye now. So again, I'm taking the medium brown, starting close to the lashes. And then I'm blending. And again, this was the brush that was only used with the dark shadow. And so that's the key. And the good news is there's a lot of great products to clean your brushes that aren't necessarily gonna make them wet. There's wipes and there's sprays, so you can use them in between. And just like every eye look you do, you just gotta make a match. And honestly, I think that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go back to my old makeup. I'm gonna go back to my old makeup. I'm gonna go back to my old makeup. I'm gonna go back to my old makeup. Honestly, the trick is making sure you're using the full extent of the eye, but it's softened so you don't create a cat eye when you don't want it. Look up again. And I am definitely someone who has a lot of years of experience, no matter how many years I do this, of experience, no matter how many years I do this, nothing ever is perfect. And I'm not worried about it because I know how to fix it. I'm gonna turn it to me. I'm gonna turn it to myself. So you can also go to your lid color and apply it under the brow bone. And if you're not great at blending, it helps blend it in. I'm actually mixing one with a little pink in it to the lightest one. I'm going to do a tight eyeline close to the lashes. Close for a second. And it's going to be in very, very black. Again it's really up to you how strong you want it. Again a cotton swab is the best thing. See if it matches. Okay. So when you're choosing mascara, make sure it's really, really black. And there's different formulas. There are curling mascaras, there are lengthening mascaras, there's thickening mascaras. And honestly, I think the formulas are all okay. Really you find one that you like. And you can go ahead and use it. And you can go ahead and use it. And you can go ahead and use it. And you can get any of the looks you want from the mascara. I personally like thickening formulas because you can always curl them. You can always add more to lengthen them. But just make sure they're really, really black. So smokey eye needs either false lashes or like four coats of really black mascara. Just a lot of false lashes. It's the building up of mascara that makes the biggest difference. It's also very tricky. Because sometimes when you just layer a bunch of mascara they can get stuck together. It's the building up of mascara that makes the biggest difference. It's also very tricky. Of course, at a party you wouldn't notice, but on the set, you notice every little thing. Mascara, you have to make sure it's not too gunky, but there is enough formula that when you apply it, it acts like a buildable lash density product that you could just literally build up the lashes. But make sure you separate it as you go, and I like to go all the way inside, but do most of it on the outside so it just kind of brings the eyes out. And I like to do top only. Sometimes I do the bottom. But mostly I do the bottom. Mostly I like to do top only. You could either stay with this beautiful smoky gray-brown, or you can actually add some sparkle, which is so much fun. And the great news about sparkle, it will really help to diffuse any shadow that's not better blended. So, . Woo! Oh. Check this out. I love it. Too much glitter? You can break it, right? Everyone should have a powder brush. So after you're done with the smoky eye or any kind of makeup, you just wipe it away. But then most likely there has been a little bit of fallout, drop down from dark. So this is just a very gentle oil stick that I am getting rid of, left over. But I'm also taking off the concealer. So I will reapply it. A little touch up of the concealer. Just blending in the concealer. I love the way she looks. She looks nice now. If you are a makeup artist for the red carpet, it really depends on what your client wants. But Fashion Week, you can take it many different places. There's a way to make it beautiful and make it stronger. You make sure that the blush is really pretty. So lips are really important. I would suggest doing something kind of lip tone. A little bit of a pinky color. And you can even add a touch of gloss. Let me show you. And by the way, for Fashion Week, we always did gloss on the eyelids. And that was also a really great look. But I think this is a perfect pretty look, for a smoky eye, that anyone can do.ье .id it, Goku. a nTch xD nTch xD nTc xD nTc xD N7c xD nTc ngO, nTcцию.iniz Thank you.",

    "data": " some clarity and actionable takeaways seeing both the complex side of shooting on set and then something very simple and very straightforward regardless of what you're shooting on and now what i want you to do is really apply these techniques that we learned in this entire chapter so grab whatever you're shooting with whether that's a smartphone a dslr a mirrorless camera and i want you to shoot a very very simple piece of content whether that's an instagram story a youtube video or just one single shot and i want you to choose an object a person or an idea or anything you're curious about shooting really and use some of the tools below that we've gone over so with the equipment that you're using knowing the pros and cons that you do now set up what you're going to shoot and use the camera to the best of its ability so i'm going to show you how to do that now let's go ahead and get started You really want to focus on maximizing the pros of your piece of equipment and really minimizing the cons or the downsides of it. Once you've gotten clear on that, use your yoga pose, right? Use your subtle movement to create a little bit more of a dynamic looking image. And I want you to experiment with different types of angles, different types of ways of shooting to really find your shooting style. And then I want you to export that piece of content and share your footage in the Q&A section and mention what you learned during that process of integrating and using the information that we went over to shoot this kind of warm up practice exercise before going more into detail on these topics later in the course. I'm looking forward to seeing the piece of content that you come up with and I will see you in the next chapter.",

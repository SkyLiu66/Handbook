So what we're going to do now is I'm going to take you through the process of taking your shot list that we've created together and I'm going to shoot this coffee montage that you've seen the kind of silly voiceover that I did for it. But my friend Vlats who's holding the camera right now is going to be our subject doing the coffee ninja things and I'm going to be shooting multiple shots, knocking out the shot list, knocking out the different shot types and I'm going to kind of walk you through what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. So before we kind of switch into that mode, I want to first set up my camera for the best looking settings for this scenario. Now because I know ahead of time that this is going to be a montage with a bunch of shots strung together, edited to soundtrack and a voiceover, definitely a voiceover, maybe a soundtrack, maybe not. But I know I want these to be slow motion shots with movement to make coffee beans and pouring look a lot more interesting. Movement helps and everything looks better in slow motion. So what I'm going to first do is go into my settings and I'm going to switch my recording mode to 60p or 59.94 which most cameras shoot, all eye which is the highest quality for my camera. And this is going to be my homemade, personally made neutral setting that we've talked about earlier in the course. And for my white balance, I'm going to actually turn and look at the scene I'm going to be shooting to find out what kind of color temperature is going to be right. We can see here that that's a little bit too tan and right about 44, 4500 should be perfect. So now my camera settings are on point. Now it's time to start shooting.",

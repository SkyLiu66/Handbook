Now you have to imagine that anytime you frame up a shot, in this case the orientation of the subject is on the right of the frame and she's looking to the left of the frame. This creates an imaginary line of the orientation of the camera and the subject. If we move the camera and break that line going on to the other side of the subject, now that flips the orientation of the entire framing. It went from the subject on the right of the frame looking to the left to now the subject on the left of the frame looking to the right. So this is the premise of the 180 degree rule. That anytime you frame a shot, you're creating a line that has to do with the orientation of the camera and the subject. When you move the camera physically, let's say that you're shooting a wide shot and you have a certain orientation set up and then you move in for a close up, but you break that line and go on the other side of that imaginary line. You're flipping the orientation of the framing. You're going from looking left to right and then suddenly the subject is looking right to left. This isn't just for people. This is for objects. Let's say a house, a doorway, any kind of a tree, any kind of outdoor environment, any situation. There's always going to be a problem. There's always going to be this 180 degree rule. That once you have those shots that you filmed and you bring that into post production, when you're trying to cut wide shots with mediums and close ups, suddenly there's a flip of orientation where everyone's looking left and then suddenly everyone's looking right. Keep this in mind when framing up your shots. It's incredibly important not to break this rule. Why is this? Because it distracts the audience, right? If suddenly I'm talking, I'm facing this way and then suddenly I'm talking and facing this way it throws out the audience and it confuses them and creates a not desired effect for the audience. We always want to keep the audience comfortable and engaged in our films. So the next form of cinematic language that we use to create these pleasing images because that's really what good films do is they create this cinematic vibe, this feeling of imagery that's pleasing to look at. So right now we're dissecting and breaking down all of this. We're breaking down all of these things and the theories behind them so that we can use these with any equipment, any camera, in any situation. So this next thing is called frame balancing or creating counterpoints. The gist of it is basically that every single object of interest in your frame has a specific weight to it. So right now I'm centered in this image. I have a certain weight where I'm holding down the middle and center and lower part of this frame. It's much more light and open and there's space out here. So if we take a look at this image where our beautiful model is framed to the left of the screen and there's a counterpoint in the background that creates an evenly weighted frame. So like I said, each point in the frame is physically carrying its own weight to it. Now if we have the same exact framing but without this counterpointed weight in the background, you can see it's an incredibly less of a cinematic image because we're losing the balance. It's almost like that image subconsciously for the viewer just wants to turn over on its side. And what we want is to create balanced framing. It's just like cooking where you're creating the perfect ingredients for this awesome amazing dish. So if there's too much of one thing, not enough of the other thing, it doesn't have that overall cohesive feeling and look. So now if we take a look at how this flower is framed, you have a left dominant framing, center dominant and right dominant framing, all with their own weights. So with this in mind, if we can balance out the primary focus of an image with a secondary point of focus or reference in the background, we can easily create much more cinematic framing and imagery. And that does it for these extra learning lessons that I added in after being in the editing process of finishing this course. I wanted to really kind of add in a little extra something from the more theoretical course. So I really hope that gives you some cool insights. In the next learning lesson, we're going to recap our ideas that we've gone over so far and keep moving into more filming principles.",

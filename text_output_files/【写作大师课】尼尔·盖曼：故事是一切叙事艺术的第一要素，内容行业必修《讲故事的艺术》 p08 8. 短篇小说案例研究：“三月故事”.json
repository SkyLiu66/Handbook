And they said, BlackBerry are launching their first smartphone, and they want to do something to do with art, and they want you to do something to do with art. I said, well, do I have to do it with a BlackBerry? And they said, no, you just have to do a thing. What would you like to do? And I said, well, I have an idea that's a bit mad. I said, so what I'd love to do is something that basically is the 21st century equivalent, of when Harlan Ellison used to write short stories in the windows of bookshops. And he would set up his typewriter and a chair in the window, and he would work. And he loved the idea that people were seeing him working and seeing what was actually happening and seeing him staring and writing and not writing. So I put together a bunch of questions, 12 questions. And they were things like, why is January dangerous? What's the strangest thing you've seen in July? What did you lose in November? Just questions that went out. What I didn't want was people suggesting titles for stories, suggesting ideas for stories. What I wanted was just to take a beautiful little idea and go, okay. That's a starting point. And for people to realize that anything could be a starting point. So my question that I asked for March was, what historical figure does March remind you of? And I thought, well, that'll be a fun question because I'll get something that's got a person in it. And the reply, it was beautiful. The one that I picked just said, Anne Bonny and her rapscallion heart dreaming for a ship of her very own. I found a notebook. I really liked this particular notebook because it's just a blank book. It's bound. I think it may even have been a misprinted book with no texting. And then, I wrote a calendar of tales at the front. I wrote down all of the months in order. And then I began to write. So it was too warm in the great house. And so the two of them went out onto the porch. A spring storm was brewing far to the west. Already the flicker of lightning and the unpredictable chilly gusts blew about them and cooled them. They sat decorously on the porch swing. The mother and the daughter. And they talked of when the woman's husband would be home for he had taken ship with a tobacco crop to far away England. Mary, who was 13, so pretty, so easily startled said, I do declare, I am glad that all the pirates have gone to the gallows and father will come back to us safely. Her mother's smile was gentle and it did not fade as she said, I do not care to talk about pirates, Mary. She was dressed as a boy when she was a girl to cover up the cold. She did not wear a woman's dress until she was on the ship with her father and with her mother, his serving girl mistress, whom he would call wife in the new world. And they were on their way from Cork to the Carolinas. She fell in love for the first time on that journey, enveloped in unfamiliar cloth, clumsy in her strange skirts. She was 11 and it was no sailor who took her heart, but the ship itself. Anne would sit in the bows watching the gray Atlantic waves and the waves would be so gentle and so gentle. And she would be so happy to be with her father. The gray Atlantic roll beneath them, listening to the gulls scream and feeling Ireland recede with each moment, taking with it all the old lies. She left her love when they landed with regret. And even as her father prospered in the new land, she dreamed of the creek and slap of the sails. Her father was a good man. He had been pleased when she had returned and did not speak of her time away. The young man whom she had married, how he had taken her to Providence. She'd returned to her family three years after with a baby at her breast. Her husband had died, she said. And although tales and rumors abounded, even the sharpest of the gossiping tongues did not think to suggest that Anne Riley was the pirate girl, Anne Bonny, Red Rackham's first mate. If you had fought like a man, you would not have died like a dog. Those have been Anne Bonny's last words to the man who put the baby in her belly. Or so they said. As Riley watched the lightning play and heard the first rumble of distant thunder, her hair was graying now, and her skin just as fair as that of any local woman of property. It sounds like cannon fire, said Mary. Anne had named her for her own mother and for her best friend in the years she was away from the great house. Why would you say such things? Asked her mother primly. In this house, we do not speak of cannon fire. The first of the March rain fell then, and Mrs. Riley surprised her daughter by getting her daughter, and Mrs. Riley surprised her daughter by getting her daughter, and Mrs. Riley surprised her daughter by getting her daughter, and leaning into the rain, so it splashed her face like sea spray. It was quite out of character for a woman of such respectability. As the rain splashed her face, she thought herself there, the captain of her own ship, the cannonade around them, the stench of the gunpowder smoke blowing on the salt breeze. Her ship's deck would be painted red to mask the blood in battle. The wind would fill her billowing canvas with a snap as loud as a cannon's roar, as they prepared to board the merchant ship and take whatever they wished, jewels or coin, and burning kisses with her first mate when the madness was done. Mother, said Mary, I do believe you must be thinking of a great secret. You have such a strange smile on your face. Silly girl, Okushla, said her mother. And then she said, I was thinking of your father. She spoke the truth, and the March winds blew madness about them. Meaning, we must be of your mind. What's lovely about that is I could absolutely see that as the end of a novel. Or I could see it as the beginning of a novel. Because we have two characters, and you have a huge and glorious problem here. Which is, you have a pirate queen, pirate captain who pled her belly, you were allowed to do that, You could escape the death sentence if you were pregnant and she was pregnant and has disappeared back into real life. She has a lot to lose if people discover that she was a pirate captain, if they discover she was a pirate. She also has a lot that's hidden, and she has abilities that are obviously not being used on a plantation. Selling tobacco, growing tobacco in March, back before the revolution. So you have a really kind of fun and wonderful setup. And yes, it could be an end. You could start the story with young Anne Bonny being dressed as a boy by her father, and you could tell her story and go through. You could actually end at the point where I end, as if this really is the end. Of a novel. Or you could begin something here. And all you have to do is to put her in difficulties. And you have her, you have a daughter, you have a husband coming back. Just bring in somebody from the past, and now we have a plot. And that feels like it has legs. I don't know who that person would be. I don't know what would happen. But I do know that she risks losing everything. And that immediately puts you in a fantastic place to tell a story with. So, let's say I wanted to turn that story, that March story, into a novel. I love the idea of respectable Anne Riley and her lovely little daughter Mary and their husband. Coming back from England. And... What's gonna happen to them? What's gonna happen when somebody turns up and throws everything into jeopardy? The first thing I would probably do is go, OK, I don't think that's enough yet. Because I don't know what it's about. Do you remember when I was talking earlier? And I said OK, you can have your plot, you can have some characters, you can have an idea, you can have a starting place. But what's it about? and you start thinking about this and you go, okay, well, it's probably about secrets. It's probably about gender roles as well. Those two things sound pretty real. It can be about the romance of piracy and the reality of piracy. That also feels like something it's about. But really, I love the idea that it's about a competent woman in danger defending herself and everything she loves. That feels like, okay, that feels like, that could be a good about. All of that other stuff, that feels real. So I need to put her into danger, which means the person who comes back into her life needs to be somehow, not only imperiling the safe life that she has, but has to be much, much more dangerous. So you go, right, let's bring somebody in to the story that you know the first thing that's going to happen is that somebody is going to come in from her past and it's going to be somebody who she is not pleased to see. That feels right. I don't know at this point necessarily whether they mean her good or ill. It might be interesting, if you're going to do that kind of thing, to have whoever is the real threat to her still not arriving. We're at the beginning of a book here. So if we're going to tell something novel-wise, then whoever comes into the story here, isn't the person who is really going to be dangerous, isn't going to be either the pirate from her past or the law officer from her past or the captain of the ship who captured her before. Those are things that aren't yet ready to come onto the stage. Something, somebody needs to come into town almost as a herald. And tell you that things are going to go wrong. And the other thing that you go is, well, we have Mary. We have a beautiful daughter. We have the romance of piracy. And much more than being beautiful, she's innocent. And that, and has been kept innocent by her mother. And she has no idea who her mother is. She has no idea what her mother is capable of. Which means that something we're going to do, somewhere in the story, probably not immediately again, but it feels like we are going to have to put Mary in danger. We're almost definitely, it feels like you're going to have to have Anne Riley go and rescue her and rescue her by becoming the Anne Bonny that she has put away. So you're not, when you're plotting, you're asking yourself, what could happen? What feels right? What will be satisfying in a book like that? The things I've said aren't a plot yet. They're saying, I think this should happen. I think this should happen. I think this kind of thing is going to happen a little bit further down the line. I have no idea who lives and who dies. I have no idea how people survive, how dark it's going to get. But what I do know is that it's going to get dark, because a book of this kind has to get dark. And there's a lovely point where it's like forking paths. When you begin any story, you have an infinite number of forking paths. Every decision, every word, every paragraph is a fork. Every decision, every word, every paragraph is a fork. Every decision, every word, every paragraph is a fork. Every decision, every word, every paragraph is a fork. By the time you're three quarters of the way through, you have a very limited number of forking paths left. And by the time you get to the end of the story, there's really only one, maybe two, maybe three paths you can go down. And you happen to know what they are and where they are. And so you keep making your choices, but your choices lead you to inevitable places, where you have to be.",

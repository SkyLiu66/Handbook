The great way is wide, and the going is easy, but how people seem to prefer the side paths. When the offices of government, the palaces and temples are richly adorned and lavishly outfitted, when the ministers are concerned chiefly with pomp and display, the fields will be dusty and overgrown with rank weeds, and the granaries of the land will be bare. The gentry wear elaborately rich embroidered clothes, eat and drink in excess with their sharp swords at their sides. These are surely the robber barons. This is not in keeping with the way. You do not need to be wise or educated to follow Tao. All you need to be is humble, soft, open to intuition, and courageous in following a path that sometimes will seem not to make any sense. In the world we live in, it is often taken for granted that the most important thing is to be able to follow Tao. The more intelligent a person is, the better their prospects in life will be. Laozi, however, does not subscribe to this idea. Following the way is not complicated. It does not require great intelligence. It is actually incredibly simple. Let go of your desires and plans for what you think should happen. Respond to the pushes and pulls of intuition. Contrary to how it may sometimes seem, this path is actually incredibly easy. The only thing that makes it difficult is our inability to put aside our ideas of what we want to do. The only thing that can get in our way is ourselves. As a human race, we are naturally inclined to follow our instincts for planning, striving, and ambition. The way is plain and simple, but our own nature constantly calls us off to side paths that lead nowhere. We think that we can find shortcuts to the path, or that there is some treasure hidden on a side path that cannot be gained through our following the way. However, if we follow these paths, we discover, sooner rather than later if we're lucky, that we can find shortcuts to the path. The only thing that makes it difficult is our inability to put aside our ideas for what we want to do. The only thing that makes it difficult is our inability to put aside our instincts for planning, striving, that the promises of the side paths were all smoke and mirrors. At this point, the only way to get back on track is to find our way back to the path from which we strayed. It will require a turning around, a forsaking of the goals and ambitions that we held so dear, and that we thought we could achieve by choosing another way. Sometimes, following the path of the doubt requires us to give up some desires completely. However, often, and only if we are able to fully let go of them, we find somewhere down the road that they come to pass anyway, often in ways that we don't know how to do. The only thing that makes it difficult is that we don't know how to do it. We find somewhere down the road that we don't know how to do it. better than we could have done ourselves, or through means that we never could have predicted. Moving on in the chapter, we are warned about the dangers of becoming too focused on outward appearances. If we spend time and effort on activities and ambitions that are meant to impress others, we will lose out on time and energy that could go towards addressing the things in our lives that really matter. If we become too focused on impressing others, we may be led to pursue this goal at the expense of these others that we are trying to impress. This is separation. Separation runs contrary to the way of the Tao, which is for all things to become one with Tao and one with each other. Seeking to impress others is a symptom of separation, because it shows a focus on the separateness of us and them. If we are truly one with another person, there is no need to try and impress them. Certainly the desire to impress others is a natural human instinct, and learning not to do so will take time. However, as we put our own desires aside and learn to follow the way, we will find how easy and natural this can be.

And thank you for watching, and I will see you all tomorrow for chapter 54. Peace and blessings.",

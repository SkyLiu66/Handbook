    "data": " Hey coffee nerds welcome back I'm Brody so great to see all of your smiling caffeinated faces check this out well actually you probably can't even see this let me dim this here check this out I'm going to show you how this is this is still too dark you know what I'm going to do throw it up right here you can follow along I'm going to hit record on my screen because today we're going to go through how to use Instagram reels for your coffee business or you know if you're just a coffee nerd at home brewing you want to show people some of your process that's what I've been doing reels is not necessarily new but some of us myself included are still taking some time to get our heads around the different functions I'm still trying to get my head around tik-tok someone wants to send me a video of how to use that for coffee I would love to see it but reels you know I use Instagram all the time so let's just jump right into it all you have to do is go over here to your stories pretty intuitive then you can see me on the screen and at the bottom you can see me on the screen and at the bottom you can see me on the screen and at the bottom you can see me on the screen and at the bottom you can see me on the screen and at the bottom you can see me on the screen and at the bottom you can see here and we have live you can see me on the screen and at the bottom you can see here and we have live you can see here and we have live stories and you know this is kind of stories and you know this is kind of stories and you know this is kind of something that they changed recently something that they changed recently something that they changed recently just to make it easier to distinguish just to make it easier to distinguish just to make it easier to distinguish each one you know I'm not gonna get into each one you know I'm not gonna get into each one you know I'm not gonna get into stories right now you're probably pretty stories right now you're probably pretty stories right now you're probably pretty pretty familiar with it but basically pretty familiar with it but basically pretty familiar with it but basically right here at the top you can choose choose this is more if you're actually going to record on the fly you know I'll show you my setup right here pretty makeshift um but if you're recording on the fly and you want to post something you know you can click how long you want the reels to be this is something that's different from TikTok I believe that you can actually make a 30 second reel or a 15 second one music uh we'll get into that in a second but basically you can just choose any track that you'd like to put over your reels in my particular case my the clip that I'm going to be using um was one you know I'm just kind of breaking up some some clips from a YouTube video that I had posted recently about five coffee photo tricks that you can use so I'm kind of just recycling some of that content to post it to my Instagram audience so I'm going to use those clips but if you you know if you're using something else you can use um you can use music from the whole the whole selection there's some effects over here I'm not going to really get into the whole selection but I'm going to show you how to do that in a second so I'm going to show you that so much um well I guess this one I'm not going to use this one so basically we're here we are and uh we're not going to use any of those things because because we're just going to upload a previous clip here's my clip and I chopped it down made sure it was around 30 seconds uh in another in another app I'll just turn up the volume here so you can kind of see there's the music and what as you can see here there's actually a horizontal display because I had filmed this for YouTube I had filmed it in landscape but the difference is that reels just just came up with this update used to they used to fill your whole entire screen and just crop the clip for you to be honest I didn't like it at first but then I thought you know I like having those reels fill up the whole entire screen it's something that I do with my Instagram photos as well I try to always shoot portrait because when people are scrolling they're going to get the full effect as opposed to shooting landscape um you might do the same you might not that's just my that's just my preference and and here too so what I'm gonna do is actually hit scale and get that nice close-up view of the coffee pouring in over the ice so we're going to just add that right there now that's done you see my face again but there's nothing more to add it I don't really want to add my you know portrait of myself or anything so we're just gonna hit go ahead you know you hit the right arrow it shows you the clip you can hear the music in the background and then this is the time to to get creative so the the up here you can see the images are the videos are on the top and then the purpose of this clip is actually just showing people the kind of different versions of the cascading effect if you're trying to take pictures you know as you can see I took some pictures here and so what I want to do is maybe just start with a little bit of an intro text so I have to do is click the center of the screen and what I'm gonna what I'm gonna write is cascading effects for iced coffee and then you know you can choose whatever whatever style you you want to put on here I've been kind of getting into this kind of a little bit faded gray color so I'm gonna stay consistent with that but what's unique here from stories because when you post on stories the major difference here is that you know the any text that you add in stories it stays on the screen the whole entire time the whole duration of the stories and also their effect on the story and the way that you can put it on the screen and also their they're divided into 15 second segments this is obviously 30 30 seconds but what you can do is actually choose when the text comes up in in the in the reel and so if you've watched a lot of reels lately you'll notice that the text seems to come up and and disappear so what I'm gonna do here is maybe I'll even crop a little bit of the the beginning you can see some of the ingredients here I'm gonna put this maybe down here a little bit and you can see I'm putting in the coffee ice cubes did not want to pin that I'm putting in some of these coffee ice cubes from the last reel if you watched it and then there you can see that it's dripping over and I just wanted to show you know until this point so maybe what I'll do is chop it there with the text and then that text is gonna disappear so for the next part and I'm not gonna take you through this whole process your video is gonna be different than mine but let me just let me just finish this off so I'm even gonna put another little text in right here saying pour in the milk of choice it's kind of a quick read put that in here this needs to be a lot a little bit longer so it takes a bit of finesse but as you can see you can get quite creative with with that part and then I'm just gonna fill in the rest of this here and I'll show you how to to post this and make the best of it anyway that's it probably don't need to put this in there for me I'll just put in my chart so I think this all shows up on there I did for a quick click so pretty helpful to see can check this because I like when you put all these in there like the difference I'm gonna set it up so that I have this space that's already takeaway so basically when I'm talking to you I have the mails in there and I'm gonna post them and maybe show this to you in another video just so you all can get a hold of this case here so okay that's done and now take care to impress that you should see my disciplining series on youtube right now if you want some help please leave a comment so we'll see how to store more templates you'll see later if you like this video in the comments below. putting it on your reels and you want people to see a specific photo when they're looking at it not like maybe it's like a photo of your face in in mid biting on a sandwich or something or or sipping a coffee maybe you want that but you get you get to choose which one they see and so i think that's probably the one that i want them to see here um and not only that if you hit here also share to feed as you can see this little slider that's going to pop up on your main feed but don't worry you can actually remove that from your feed later if you're not super into having it on your grid and it still stays in your reel so this is a good way to kind of introduce that you just posted a new reel to your audience um but then you can get rid of it later once you know you feel like enough people have seen it so you can write a quick caption here i you know i'm going to kind of keep it simple but basically uh i'd love to see your cascading coffee photos you just hit share boom there it is takes a little bit of time to to load and appear there because i guess it's a heavy file um but then you'll see it in your feed you'll see it in your reels people can follow along and it's super fun so um that's basically it if you want to test out the music and test out some of those other functions and features for reels um that's not a bad idea at all i love being able to do that and just pick my favorite songs and not have to worry about going into editing software and downloading the music and finding the license for you or whatever so that is fun you know here's here's uh here's another one where i was able to use some from tribe called quest and you just add it in later uh this is a this is a clip that i i didn't have music for it's all kind of like fast fast clips as you can see this is an example of one that you can just do on your phone on the fly i personally use it a lot more than i do on my phone so i'm going to like to film before so i'm not like stuck in the instagram app the whole entire time in case it you know you close the app or you know you get a message and it takes you away so i like to just record the videos from my phone and then edit it later um which also allows you to do so have fun check it out let me know what you think i'm gonna stop that recording here i'd love to hear your adventures with instagram reels and maybe even tiktok if you have any tips for how to make the of tiktok in the coffee world or any of your any of your interests really shoot me a comment down below like this video if you got anything out of it and subscribe because i'm excited to share some more coffee related content and also hear some of your your feedback on what do you want to hear so hope to hear from you soon that is instagram reels i will see you later",

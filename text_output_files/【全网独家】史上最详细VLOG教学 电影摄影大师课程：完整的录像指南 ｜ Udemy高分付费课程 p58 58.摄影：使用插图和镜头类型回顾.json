So I'm going to kind of recap here a little bit so you guys can really make this understanding of different shot types very concrete because it's incredibly important for all your future video projects. Having different framing of the same scene gives depth and personality, just like the fire footage that we saw with the drummer. If we didn't have the different kind of personality framing and shot choices, it's like it just happens in a moment, right? But when we stretch things out and show things of importance, zoom ins, close ups, far away shots, we get a certain feeling that we're trying to convey to the viewer and it transports the viewer to really the scene that we're shooting. The goal of this is to make sure that the viewer feels that the scene is really important to them. But the goal is to make the ordinary action look extraordinary. We all want our videos to look special and unique and different and impactful, and this is one of the best ways to do that. So I'm going to walk you guys through an exercise as well of how I do that for a very ordinary looking scene. And of course, this is really carving out an experience for the viewer. So we always keep our viewers attention and what they're supposed to be seeing. So this is really important. And we're going to talk about that a little bit. So, in this video, we're going to talk about how to make sure that your video is extraordinary. And we're going to talk about how to make sure that your video is extraordinary. And we're going to talk about how to make sure that your video is extraordinary. in mind. And to kind of use a metaphor, you know, using these different framing types are like words, right? Different kind of words that when put together create sentences that become your scene or become kind of like the paragraph whole explanation of your video. And if you want to dive more into this kind of theoretical side of cinematography and really the filmmaking process, because filmmaking has moved from more of an art and a passion about the filmmaking process itself to more video creating and more online video use. So it's been an interesting transition. But if you do want to learn more about this, I'll link my other course that really dives more into these fundamental, deep, deep, deep, timeless filmmaking principles. And I also have free filmmaking tutorials on my YouTube channel. So if you want to learn more about this, I'll link my other course that really dives more into these fundamental, deep, deep, timeless filmmaking principles. And I also YouTube channel that kind of go more into this side of the video creating process. And that about sums it up for shot choice and knowing when to use what type of shot. Very important concept. So if you do have any questions, hop over to the student Q&A, put your questions in there. And if you see any questions from other students that you know the answer to that you want to engage with, feel free to engage with your fellow students. In the next lecture, we're going to be talking about a part that I like very much, which is camera movement. I'm going to show you guys and really give you the understanding of how and when to use different types of camera movement, because it's called motion picture, right? It's one of the benefits that film and video has that photography doesn't have is the ability to move the camera through space and the ability to help tell your story and make more impactful videos through this movement. I really, really appreciate it. And I'll see you in the next lecture. Bye. Bye. Bye.",

The straw dog is generally used to symbolize something that has little worth or that is discarded after use. This metaphor is basically to say that we should strive not to take sides, and should regard people objectively and impartially. Now let's talk about this part about heaven and earth being like a bellows. A bellows is only useful for its job because it is empty inside. If it were filled with things, it wouldn't work properly. Can you think of any other objects that are useful only because they're empty? Things like buckets, bowls, cups, or even rooms come to mind. But this applies not only to objects, but to people as well. What does it mean for a person to be empty? Well, that could mean a lot of things. For example, perhaps the emptiness Laozi is talking about refers to a lack of ambitions or distractions to cloud our judgment. Have you ever ended a meditation that just really felt like you got what you needed out of it? How would you describe how you feel after a really good meditation like that? Maybe this is different for different people. For me though, after a really good meditation, I feel empty. I feel like my mind is clear and clear. I feel like I'm not alone. I feel like I'm not alone. I feel like I'm not alone. I feel like I'm not alone. I feel like I'm not alone. I feel like someone has worked hard since I moved everything into this world while since taking it so seriously.

Okay everyone, I think I'm sent back and having a conversation with theestate that one thing how dirty your windshield really was, and what a relief it is now to have it so clean and clear. Emptiness in our minds and hearts adds clarity. It makes a space for intuition to come through. I think maybe this is one of the reasons for the line, the more you talk of it, the less you comprehend. As we already learned in chapter one, words and names are not precise, and sometimes I think too much explaining can clog the gears up a little bit. If you over-explain something, it doesn't leave as much space for intuition to work, and this can lead to confusion. So, in the spirit of not over-explaining, I'll leave it there for today, and I'll see you guys tomorrow for chapter six. And remember to join the discord.",

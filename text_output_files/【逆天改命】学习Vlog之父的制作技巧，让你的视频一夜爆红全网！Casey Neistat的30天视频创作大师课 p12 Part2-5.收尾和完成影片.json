    "data": " In the last lesson, we edited the first act of my video. And I walked you through every shot I chose, every cut I made, why I did that, and what my thinking was. In this lesson, we're going to finish editing that video, but I'm going to approach it a little bit differently. In the time since the last class, I went through and I finished editing the video. And then I broke it into different sequences. And what I want to do is I want to look at each of those sequences and explain exactly the thinking behind it. So in this lesson, rather than focusing on the shot by shot, I want to talk about the big picture thinking behind these sequences, how they work into my movie, and how together they're going to tell a complete story. So let's get started. If you remember, I left off just as I was entering the studio. So this sequence, this is the sequence where I'm unpacking the glasses. Now this plays a vital role in the overall narrative because this is the bridge taking us from the first act into the second act. What was challenging here is that I was going to do a little bit of a jump. I was going to do a little bit of a jump. I was going to do a little bit of a jump. I was going to do a little bit of a jump. I was going to do a little bit of a jump. I was going to do a little bit of a jump. I was going to do a little bit of a jump. I was going to do a little bit of a jump. I was going to do a little bit of a jump. I was going to do a little bit of a jump. So what I was doing was that I was looking at all of these shots. They're very similar. They're all shot overhead for the most part. They're of one thing, which are these glasses. Same colors, same images, same tone, not a lot of variety here. So how do you make that work when you have, whatever this is, 35 different shots that were all shot on that two by four foot square right there? How do you make that work? What I focus on is shot variety. You were with me when I was shooting that, and I put a lot of effort into constantly changing the camera angles, making sure that the cinematography was really, really good. really compelling, really fun, but always different. Some super up close shots, some of the wider shots from overhead, I would take the camera off of the overhead rig, I'd lay it on the table, put the subject right in front of it. Those cut together in sequence with a really great song underneath them, and then breaking up that music with either lines of monologue or just some comical way or clever way to use the diagenic sound to sort of keep the momentum flowing. All of that in aggregate leaves you with something very satisfying. This technique, this is a device I use in so many of my movies. You've seen my YouTube videos. I always fall back on this because it's always fun to make. I find it incredibly satisfying to watch and it does convey information. This is a story. This is sort of the story, the beginning of the story that is the second act. So let's have a look. I'm gonna show it to you complete first and then let's break it down. Well that was an adventure, wasn't it? But I was surprised the idea I had learned a lot because I didn't want even one second on the ground to passetzage, this was like four minutes of siding stuff that I sacrificed. So here's a very good story I want to run through. When it comes to siding stuff, I always wanted to sit back and flourishing and teach myself till the 밑° an amazing message,латting a good one for you through DS samplers once again, Got that? us from act one into act two, the unboxing sequence. So a couple of things that I really want to bring attention to here are the decision not to use music here. Act two is heavy with the music, but the very intro to act two, this bridge, I don't have any music. And the reason why, the diegenic audio, the natural, like the actual audio from these shots is great. Listen. It's like ASMR. Is that what it is? It's like ASMR. Like it's a satisfying oral experience. I love it. Ready? All of these noises, the chaos of me opening and throwing things around. And then it ends with me delivering a line. Right off the bat. So that was some of the thinking behind like the audio here. That was an adventure, wasn't it? I also knew two things. I'm coming out of a song. Remember, when I'm driving back to my studio on the skateboard, it was fast paced. Everybody's saying hi, music underneath it, action packed. Coming out of this, the very next sequence, which is when I start to customize the glasses, that too has like a funky song that's pretty fast underneath it. So this bridge is a time to kind of pay attention and catch your breath. Now, I mentioned this when we were filming. I'm not going to go into too much detail on this, but I'm going to go into a little bit of detail on this. So this bridge is a time to kind of pay attention and catch your breath. Now, I mentioned this when we were filming. This sequence, but there's real purpose behind the chaos in which I unbox things. I'm unboxing things here. I'm throwing things. I'm tearing things up. And I do that for cinematic effect. Like if I wasn't recording, I'd probably open these things like a normal human. But I do it for camera because one, it's funny. It's always funny. And a little humor goes a long way, especially in a video like this. But then also it's cinematically compelling to watch. Like who behaves like this? I don't know. But this is interesting. I otherwise probably wouldn't be so interested in watching a pair of sunglasses being unboxed. Before I move on to the next sequence, every shot here from this first shot of the bag being thrown down all the way through the second to last shot of the glasses in my hands, every one of these shots is from my perspective, my POV. You're seeing my hands. Except when we get to the last shot in this sequence. Right off the bat, I see one thing wrong. I see a couple of things wrong. With these. That's the reversal. Now, from the table's perspective, you're seeing me. And what I'm saying right off the bat, I see one one thing wrong with these. Now, what that line is trying to deliver on is one, if you're in on the joke, meaning you're a regular viewer of my videos, you know that I don't really wear regular glasses. I wear these customized ones. So maybe you're going to know that's coming. And if you've never seen my videos before, you don't know anything about my sunglasses. I say there's one thing wrong with these. The thinking is like, what's wrong with them? Like, tell me what's wrong with them. So what that's doing is it's teeing up the next part of this story. It's queuing up the next part of this story. It's letting you, the viewer know the next part of this story is about to begin. And that story is the one thing that I see wrong with these I'm about to address. So now we're at the next sequence and I put the last shot from the previous sequence to start it so you can see it in context. I'm going to play it through and then break it down. Right off the bat, I see one thing wrong. I see one thing wrong with these. Done. Okay. So that was 42 seconds, 43 seconds. And a lot was said there. So when I was actually shooting this, I think I said to camera that this part of this video of making these glasses look like my other glasses, this could have been its own video without a doubt. In teeing it up in the previous sequence, I wanted it to feel like it was my glasses. And I wanted it to feel like it was my glasses. And I wanted it to feel like something huge was going to happen. This customization process to be huge. When in reality, I compressed it down to 43 seconds. A couple of tricks that I did here that I wanted to point out first is dropping out the music here. So pulling down this, the white deli paper that I use as seamless for the backdrop here. I knew this sound was going to be rich. I knew this sound would break up the song nicely. And I, I do it subtly. So if you look at my timeline here, the music drops out and then the music picks back up. And when I do that, I'm going to be able to hear the background noise before the noise from the backdrop is down. Ready? Those subtle, those tiny, those, those almost unnoticeable moments. I try to have those throughout every video I make. I'm always searching for those because while it's almost imperceivable when you're watching this movie as a whole, it's another little moment of like happiness or pleasure or interestingness. It's another one of those little like, dopamine injections that makes the video feel really good to watch, really satisfying to watch. Watch. I'm spending a lot of time on these two seconds, but finding those moments throughout the entire video, putting them together. That's what makes something feel special. This is how you're setting your tempo. This is how you're finding your pacing is by leaning into those sorts of things. Now I did something similar with when I completed the painting. So the spray painting is done and now I'm checking the music. I'm going to check in to see if the glasses are ready. And the moment that I drop the music out, I use the sound of me moving the garbage can away, that garbage can, to hide the music coming out. And then it's like, it's like you're running, running, running, you're sprinting, sprinting, sprinting, you're stopping and you're looking. It's bringing all of the attention to the glasses saying they're done, but I'm not sure. The precision that is this shot. Look. This one lens is filling the frame. This one lens is the focal point. You can see the, the, what would you call the aerosol from the spray paint falling onto the lens, dripping into the cracks. The same shot, slightly different angle. So you can see the paint hitting the lens. I covered the lens with a little tape first, but you can see the paint hitting the lens. This shot, the interior, the last like vestiges of black. On these frames being covered in paint. That this shot here, the perfect sort of handheld hand out of focus, super soft focus, the red nozzle of the spray paint can bright, vivid in your eye, the focus solely on the glasses. This is perfect. And then this garbage shot. It's meant to say subtly that calculated, precise precision. Okay. Hold on. Stop all that. Stop all that. Stop all that. And let me just see if these things, are they actually done here. That messaging is done through this kind of cinematography. And as I'm hearing myself explain this to you, I'm realizing a couple of things. Number one, I've never explained this before. To be honest I've never really thought about this. I've never kind of intellectualized what I'm doing before, especially with these little moments of nothing. I'm thinking about it. And it's like you're gonna see what I'm doing. And the other thing that I'm really impressed with is, it's like you could have a great shot, but you can't see it. You're gonna see it with all the I think these little things, these little like nods, these little, I call them tricks or whatever, this is just something you accumulate over time. I'm thinking like, I've been making these kinds of videos now since I was a teenager. All of this methodology I use to sort of make every second as interesting as I can. This is just stuff that I've learned over time. I think like this thing, like embracing uninteresting sounds, embracing this sound. This is an interesting filmmaking right here. But embracing that probably came from some accident I did when I was filming some shot and I made some noise and then the song didn't line up and I'm like, oh, what's this? What's this audio waveform? What is this? And then I play it back. It's a garbage can moving. Let me actually try to use that. It worked. And then over time, these little things stopped being accidents. They started being intentional. They started being tools that I'm able to use to tell a story with as much intimacy as I can. You know, all of my movies, they try to sort of say one thing. They try to have this underlying sort of tone, which is that, I love making this. And that is sort of meant to be said through every aspect of it, through the cinematography, through the editing, through all of that. And it's funny that this like diatribe that I'm delivering to you right now was motivated, was inspired by the sound of a garbage can. But it was. And I think before I end this to get back to my edit, the takeaway here is you'd never know what, works. There's nothing here that is right or is wrong. It's entirely at your discretion. You are the arbiter of what's right, of what's wrong, of what's good, what's bad, what's interesting and what's boring. And for whatever reason, this sound of a garbage can, I find it fascinating. And it's so much so I'm putting it in my movie. I'll get back to the edit now. Ready? Okay. Garbage can. Is this dry? Yeah, it sort of feels dry. Now, obviously this shot is intentional, but this shot of me comes after about 15 or 20 other shots, none of which contain me. All POV. These are all from my perspective and I end that by bringing it to me. Hmm. I'm curious. Is this thing dry? I can't tell. These look good. Yeah, this is dry. And then the next sequence, this sequence, the sequence that goes with the scratching, this is meant to be another bridge. This fun stuff, this pacing, this weird like 1970s Ibiza music, it's over. And now I'm just trying to say, is this right? Does this feel dry? And I need to take some of this paint off. This is close. This is getting there. Let me polish it. By the way, I didn't have a cloth, so I'm using my mask to polish it in this shot. Done. Okay. One last thing I need to point out from this sequence before I move on. This is where I have my black shirt on. It took, you know, it took a while for the paint to dry on these glasses. In that while, I had forgotten what I was wearing. I'd forgotten that the shots need to match. I didn't want to make the fact that it took days for the paint to dry part of this narrative. There's already enough going on, but I had a different shirt on. In this shot, which is exactly... Done. Eight seconds prior, I'm wearing a different shirt. I didn't address it because it doesn't matter. And to be honest, like this kind of mistake, this sort of mistake falls into this philosophy that I call like showing your scars, embracing your screw up. See, it's really easy to make something that's perfect. And perfection, perfection often omits the human hand. I think of something like, CGI, computer generated imagery in an action movie of a car crash, let's say. It's big. It's over the top. It's unbelievable. It's something that your eye probably will never see because it's not real. And then I think of a car accident that was shot practically with real effects from like a movie from the 70s or 80s or whatever. Not as fantastical. The explosion's not as big. It's not as perfect. The car doesn't do two somersaults in the air. But there's something about that crash that feels real. That feels... tangible. That you trust. Even if you don't stop to think about it, when you see those crashes in an old movie, you see explosions in an old movie, that seems real. It seems like something you can see with your eye and you know that what you're seeing actually happened in real life. Now, that kind of thinking, it sort of applies here too. By me not trying to hide my screw ups, instead I just own them. It just gives off this sense, this ethos that this whole video that's about a pair of sunglasses, it's just one guy trying to make it. Because he thinks it might be an interesting subject to tackle. A fun exercise to lean into the things that I love doing. Using my cameras, taking pictures, capturing this city, shooting in this crazy studio that I built, and making something. Those are all things that I love. This video's the vehicle for it. Done. Done. So the glasses are done. What comes next? Ask yourself right now, what do you want to see next? After stating the glasses are done, show me the glasses. And that's the next sequence. The next sequence is, some glamour shots of the glasses themselves, showing off what I've done, and then I'm setting up. I'm taking that to set up act three. Let's have a look. Done. I mean, I think they look pretty good on me. That's where that ends. That's where the setup ends. So, I'll show you where that goes, but for now, those 18 seconds, they're taking us from my customization, showing you what it looks like to me actually wearing the glasses. To me actually starting this third act. Now, I want to break it down, but before I do, please indulge me, because I want to break down this one shot. This one insignificant shot right here, took me forever to do. So what I was trying to do is, glasses are filling up. I'm filling the frame. I pick up the glasses. The camera racks to my face. The glasses go on, and I do all of that without touching the camera. Why did I care so much about that? I don't know. Maybe it's my interest in cameras. Maybe it's like, my enthusiasm for great cinematography. I don't expect anyone to ever notice this, but I did this so when I see it, I can remember how hard this shot was. Glasses, razor sharp focus. Ready? As they leave frame, the focus is now on my face. Let's even go a little tighter. Ready? Glasses in focus. Glasses in focus. Watch the minute I touch them. Now the focus is drifting back to my face in the mirror. As hard as that was to pull off, all I really did was pick a focal point in the frame that is occupied by both the glasses and my face. So this area here, probably just above the bridge of the glasses, the bridge of the nose of the glasses, that's where I'm going to focus. The bridge of the nose of the glasses. That's where I set my auto focus point. So the minute the glasses move, the minute I move this bridge right here, the focus is going to search for something else to land on. The nearest thing to land on is what's behind them, which is me, and that's where the focus goes to. Does that shot help me tell my story better? Does that shot touch on themes that are universal? It doesn't do any of those things. But this shot for me is a great shot. It's kind of an illustration of a passion that I have for just interesting cinematography. This is me playing with my camera, and I did this just for me because no one will ever notice. Do that enough. Try to put that in every shot, some sense of that in every shot, and then in aggregate, when you finish your movie, when all those shots are strung together, even though no one will notice those details, they'll know one thing, which was that was really satisfying to watch. Here's the sequence again. I mean... And the song here needed to be cut as well. This is another song by that same artist, and before I adjusted the song, it just kind of went on and on and on. It would have sounded like this. And that's not a satisfying place to cut the music. It just doesn't work right there. So I took the ending of the song, which is right here. I took this ending, and then I found a break in the song where that ending would line up with. I put the two together, essentially chopping, you know, the centerpiece out of the song, merged them. I mean... Again, very satisfying to watch. Now, each of these shots here, this shot here focuses on the lens, the lens of the glasses. Whether you notice that or not, that is the point of that shot. This next shot here. This is the other lens. That's the focal point there. This shot here. This is the shot just to show the frames, the whole frames. So why not put a really rich rack focus in there? This shot, I wanted to show the Ray-Ban logo on the side of these things. But why not put a little movement in there? Why not sort of mix it up? Static shot, static shot, rack focus, movement. This shot, that's the zoom out. My hope was to be able to make this shot and then the rack focus shot one. But after, you know, 40 minutes of trying to figure it out, I just gave up. But they do work together. This jerky zoom out. And then the finishing shot. So that's the bridge. That's what's supposed to get us to the third act. So act three has to deliver on the promise that was made at the beginning of the video. Act three has to be the part of this movie. The part of this movie that's about the glasses themselves. I talked about this idea before we went out shooting. But this scene, even though it's about the video camera glasses, this scene effectively is a tech review. I start from a place of no one cares about tech reviews and no one cares about these stupid glasses. And they are stupid. They don't work well. But nobody cares about it. Can I still make something interesting here? Can I still make these last four minutes, three minutes, interesting? Compelling enough for someone who has no interest in the objects themselves to stay engaged, to keep watching and say, yeah, those glasses are stupid. But that was really interesting. That's my goal. So even in introducing these glasses, that's my consideration. I mean, I think they look pretty good on me. Very deliberately with this shot. I used a spherical lens, a really wide lens. So as I get close to it, my face would almost warp. But the glasses would maintain. Center frame and the main focal point. I mean, I think they look pretty good on me. Straight into a shot that's much more punched in. This is a 70 millimeter shot right here. But where the focus is really just on the glasses. The lens right there. OK, to start a recording, I push this button right here. OK, it's recording. Again, there are two ways to have done that. How I did it is I'm exploring the object. Oh, it's working. I could have easily put the glasses down on a table and said, the way you begin the recording process is by hitting the button that's on the right arm of the glasses. That's not interesting. This way, it's me actually discovering how to use these things. I'm just kind of bringing you along on my journey. I'm not doing this to inform you. I'm bringing you with me. We're doing this together. And that distinction, while not overt, while not on the surface, that distinction is at the core of this kind of video for me. Lens right there. OK, to start a recording, I push this button right here. OK, it's recording. OK, this. So this is me talking into a mirror. The purpose of that is obviously these glasses take a lot of time. They're not going to be able to see me. Obviously, these glasses capture from my perspective. So how do I show that I'm recording on the glass? I use the mirror here as a little trick, something a little bit interesting to connect the third person footage of me with this first person footage that I captured. OK, this next sequence was shot entirely on my sunglasses. And those are sunglasses. Let's go. Let's go. The introduction has been made. I've informed the audience about what they're about to see. Now let's go do it. So this next sequence, this next sequence that I cut in its entirety was shot on these glasses. And I have to say the footage was not impressive. I'm only saying that here because I had this idea of making this sort of like very fun travel sequence, this adventure. This was Candice and me leaving New York so I could get her back to L.A. We went together on a plane. It seemed like such rich subject matter. But the footage was terrible. The footage was borderline unusable. This is what the footage looked like. It was formatted strangely. And then it was sort of murky and mushy and shaky and not particularly pleasant to watch. I wasn't able to like shape a story using the footage. It didn't work in low light. The image was too narrow. For a million reasons, I just I wasn't happy when I sat down and looked at it. And more importantly, it forced me to read it. It forced me to reevaluate how I wanted to portray this scene. So what I did is I really chopped it up. I tried to find moments in each clip where whatever action I was trying to capture was clear enough and then just string them together in sequence. And I don't think that if the subject matter was any less compelling, meaning like me on a plane with my wife, it was pretty exciting stuff to capture. If I just captured me walking around New York. I don't think this would have been compelling because the imagery sucked. Big lesson to learn here. There's a takeaway that really underscores the value of great cinematography. But that's kind of neither here nor there. Instead, the problem at hand is how do I make this sequence work? So I grabbed a song that I liked. I picked out shots that I thought really well sort of worked enough. And of the let me count them off here for you. Of the 96 shots, 96 different shots, different shots. Different perspective, different images that I captured on the glasses. I used about 20 of them. And each shot being 30 seconds long. Each shot averages in my video about a second to a second and a half. That's the best I could do. Again, this is one of those times where the outcome of a great idea did not meet your expectations. Your only opportunity to address that, to fix that, to make your movie work is getting in the edit bay and stopping at nothing to figure it out. Because believe me. This was another point in time when I wanted to just throw this movie away. This is what it looks like. It's recording. Uh. Okay, this next sequence was shot entirely on my sunglasses. And those are sunglasses. Let's go. I gotta go. We're gonna miss our flight. Crying? Yes, thank you sir. You guys have a great flight and happy weekend. Thank you so much. Thank you. Awesome man. Nice to meet you. You too, honey. Take care. Bye. Bye. Did it work? Yep. Thank you. Uh. Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome you to Los Angeles. Bye bye now. Bye. Thanks. Have a good day. Hi, Freddie. Hello, my baby. Hi, Joshy. Come on. Come on, let's go inside. Bye, daddy. Bye, Georgie. Have fun at ballet. All of that footage. So that's the sequence. And if you're saying to yourself right now, it doesn't look that bad, know that in order for me to put that sequence together, I had to scrub through every frame of all 96 shots to find enough shots where the image was usable to even make sense of that. Um. So I do like that. I do like the way it turned out. But it was a very frustrating, a very challenging process to get there. So let's talk about some of the decisions that I made. Now, I think my wife's fascinating. So any opportunity I could lean into her, use shots of her, use her voice, I did. All of the footage on the airplane, unusable because of the audio. But this stuff in the airport, the stuff in the airport I shot with real intent. This shot here. I literally shot this. I literally shot this. I literally was like a shot of me holding her hand would be very cute. I was walking through the airport with my head down and I gently grabbed her hand because because I thought it'd be cute. And one big unexpected win was when I got to the airport finding this this guy playing the piano. I knew the second I saw him that I'd be able to do something with this audio. I was like, finally, finally something. And then what I did is I I took the audio from him playing the piano and I laid that under some footage on every sort of note that he hits. I cut the video to the note and then right up to my kids. And while I try to avoid putting my kids in my videos, they're really cute and they're an easy crutch to lean on. And all of a sudden hearing me and my genuine enthusiasm to see my baby girl after a few days away sort of makes you forget about the terrible image you're looking at and sort of appreciate the story. Appreciate what's happening there. Hello, my baby. Come on, let's go inside. Bye, George. You have fun at Bell. This shot of my little one here. I really didn't want to show her face, so I just pulled the audio of her saying bye, daddy. And I put some shots over it and a shot of the back of her head. And this shot works. I don't think anybody will notice, but know that it did take some effort. It did take some time to sort of mask her appearance. I say that not to give you advice on how to do this, but I do want to give you some advice on how to do this. So I'm going to show you a little bit of a video of my little girl. And I'm going to show you a little bit of a video of my little girl. And a shot of her face. I pull across thesun<|de|> wcześniej. See? It's beautifully done and I'm going to just curl it up. So I'm going to take one of my cameralers, this little one over here, and I'm going to create a little bit of aIG Boris.

It's just so late. Oh, right, thanks. We're going to do something fun. Our favorite child. Bye, Georgie. Have fun at ballet. And that's where the sequence ends. So we're talking about the sort of crux of this entire video, which is me finding out if these glasses are worth a damn or not is one minute of what will end up being a nine-minute video. I think that's okay. Again, my goal here is to make something that's interesting for everyone, not just make something impelling for people who might be interested in this exact product, but also I was working around the fact that I just didn't like what I had captured there. I'm forcing a story into this, and I'm leaning on whatever resources I can find, in this case my wife, this adventure she and I are on, and then my cute little kids. And that just brings me to the ending. So how do I end this? How do I end this adventure? This adventure that began with me sitting here, that I then delved into repairing the camera on my door, that I sort of established the mission, the objective, the goal of this video is to sort of determine whether or not these video camera Ray-Ban glasses are worth a damn. Then I went on this odyssey, crossing, zigzagging this entire city, going to three different stores with this uncertainty. Am I actually going to find them? I found them. Then bringing in all of these characters that I find, from the security guard at the Ray-Ban store asking for a selfie, to some guy on a skateboard going down Broadway, to these girls that screamed hello because they were excited about my camera, to my wife, my children, the salesperson, the guy on the phone, all the characters telling this story. How do I end it? Well, I end it by really selling that promise. I end it with what is essentially a tech review. And I give this tech review, without violating sort of the rules that I set about making it interesting for anyone, I give a tech review that's free from anything, without any technical specifics. I don't talk about the battery life. I don't talk about how you use the app that you connect with the glasses. My rule is not to give any information that you could simply read off the box. If you want to know about these glasses, just Google them. But if you want to know what I think about these glasses, well then come on this journey with me. So this is where I landed. And I did do a little fun camera trick here, which is, when I got back to LA, I walked into my house, I set up my camera, like in the little office, and I was like, oh, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. This is the office I have there. And I walked into the room with the camera rolling ahead of time, with the glasses recording as I entered the room. And then I tried my best, and I think it's pretty seamless, to cut from my glasses to the camera mid-sentence. And right then, what I'm trying to do is get the viewer to snap out of the fact that you're looking at this garbage image from the glasses, and instead see this beautiful image from my proper camera, by seeing me with the glasses on. This is what that looked like. I like this. This felt good. Hey, Georgie! Come on, let's go inside. Bye, Daddy! Bye, Georgie. Have fun at ballet! All of that footage was shot on these glasses. That's what it looks like. Did you miss it? All of that footage was... You can hear the audio change here. I'll play it again. Video from the sunglasses, where you can see what's going on. Where you can see my camera right here. You see the camera in frame. All of that footage was shot on these glasses. That's what it looks like. It's not bad. There's a little bit of a formatting. I need to stop and explain this, but let me just show you. I talk about the formatting. The way I explain the formatting was something that I thought... I wasn't sure how I was going to explain it, but I like where I landed. Just watch, and then I want to explain. Let me... Okay, so natively, the shot's supposed to look like this. See how it's square now? So again, I'm going to break that down. There's a little bit of a formatting issue. I say there's a formatting issue. I turn my head to walk out of this room, immediately cut to the glasses, where you see me walking towards the bathroom, and then I'm in the bathroom, looking into the mirror, explaining what's wrong with the formatting. Now, the reason why I don't want to show you my whole ending... I mean, I'll show you my whole ending. It goes like this. Okay, the look may be the most important. I like the look. I mean, it required a little camera. And I talk about how they look just like my other glasses. And they're Ray-Bans. Perfect. I say they look great. And then I get into... This is the raw footage now. Next major dislike. I get into my likes and my dislikes. Okay. The reason why I don't want to show you this ending is I left Los Angeles to come back to New York to make all these lessons, to do this whole monthly thing. And I'm editing this back, and I'm like, this isn't right. I give it sort of like this gentle, soft ending where I say... Where did I put them? Where I say that I like these, and I say that the footage isn't bad. This is the first line. The footage is not bad. This footage is bad. These things suck. They look great. But the quality is not there. And I don't know why I didn't say that. I think that when I shot this, I hadn't spent as much time with the footage as I now have. So I'm not comfortable making this ending. It feels like a lie. I want to go back to Los Angeles and reshoot this ending and make it much harsher. I want to give it some teeth. I want to let them know what I really think of these glasses, which is that they're a huge disappointment. Put so much effort into these things, they make them... I won't give it to you. But look, they could be better. And the fact that I didn't film it is now disappointing. It's just disappointing that instead of saying how I actually felt, for whatever reason, I gave this soft review. So therefore, this is not my ending. My ending is going to be something much more aggressive. So I've been thinking about that. And what does that mean? And I think how I'm going to do it is I'm going to go get an old pair of Google Glass from seven years ago. And then I'm going to get Snapchat's first pair of Snapchat Spectacles. And I'm going to show the camera what those two older pieces of hardware can deliver, which is vastly superior to what these things deliver. And that's going to be my ending. So the lesson here and the reason why I don't have a perfect ending for this video, the lesson here is that sometimes you get this far in the process. Like I should be done. See these clips here? These six clips are the ending of my video. I shot them. I did multiple takes. I gave them some forethought. It's a cool shot. I'm in a different environment. I shot it in LA. This was a lot of effort. I felt really good when I turned off the camera saying, mission accomplished. I got this whole movie in the can. And then like, you know, five days of editing later, I realized, ugh, that is not my ending. And I have to go back to the drawing board. I have to pick the camera back up and I have to make this ending work. Because your video is going to live on forever. Before you call it done, you have to make sure it's exactly what you want. So despite the fact that I'm pulling an audible on my ending, I still think this is like a home run of a short video. I'm really proud of the way it turned out. When I think about this video, the things that excite me the most are all of the unexpected twists and turns. I expected it to be a video about these glasses. I expected it to be shot in my studio with maybe a little peppering in of going to the store. Those were all things that I had expected. I didn't foresee the intro. The whole bit about the GoPro. I didn't foresee all the people that I was going to get to meet. I forgot what it's like to film in New York City where everybody says hi to me in the street. Those were all the unexpected aspects of this movie that now like are all piled together. And when I'm about to click playback, those are the most exciting things for me. Those are the things I'm most excited about. Now normally a playback process would be really slow and tedious. I keep stopping to fix it until I make it all the way through without any checks. But because I walked you through each of the sequences here, I'm not going to stop. But I am going to play it back now all the way through until I get to my ending, which I hate. And then I'll stop it. So apparently... What is going on here? Huh. The door cam is a GoPro Hero 4. This thing's probably been on nonstop for like six years, seven years. I think I finally killed it. Come on! It still works! Ah, it's better. So apparently Ray-Ban launched a pair of sunglasses that have a built-in camera. Now I've been known from time to time to wear sunglasses and I also sometimes... use a video camera. So this seems like maybe an appropriate product for me. Happy to see the city hasn't gotten any quieter since I've been gone. Okay, can I have a pair of these? But we don't have this style in store. Okay, they didn't have them there, but I got a phone call while I was in there from a different Sunglass Hut, which is crazy because I didn't give them my phone number. Whatever. I'm going downtown. Gonna get them now. Can I take a quick picture of you? Alright, I'll see you. Keep up the good work! Sorry. It's good to be back in the city. I hope they have them. How are you? Nice to see you. I'm Irving. I'm the store manager here. Irving, thank you so much. Anytime. Irving, I got a question. Yes. How did you get my phone number? Well, I have a caller ID and I have a list of the people that have called. I'm asking for them. Okay, that makes sense. You called here earlier. Okay, okay. I remember you. Thank you. Irving, thank you so much. Nice to meet you. You're the best. Take care. Can I get a picture with you? Yeah, of course. Of course. Of course. Can I see you? Can we take a picture? Yeah, of course. Thank you so much. You're back? Not yet. Not yet. Alright. I miss this city though. Nice. We miss you too. Oh my God. Dude, can I get a picture with you? Yeah, totally. Yeah, you're on my vlog. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Yeah. We have plans for our next mom. What? For the mom. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That feels good. Yeah. But the mom needs you, right? Yeah. Your mom needs you, Кор. Yeah. Your mom needs you. Yeah. Wait a minute. Hey. After this... Hey. You wanna play with me? Let's go before you leave tomorrow. How do you people like seeing parents? How did you get married at home? Put your money in the bag. Your mom. What's the Såade next to me? right off the bat i see one one thing wrong with these done i mean i think they look pretty good on me it's the lens right there okay to start a recording i push i push this button right here okay it's it's recording uh okay this next sequence was shot entirely on my sunglasses and those are sunglasses let's go i gotta go oh i gotta go we're gonna miss our flight are you crying yes thank you sir thank you so much thank you awesome man nice to meet you take care did it work yeah thank you bye-bye now bye thanks have a good day bye hi fanny hello my baby come on let's go inside bye daddy bye georgie have fun at ballet all of that footage was shot on these glasses that's what it looks like it's not bad uh there's like a there's a little bit of a formatting issue let me okay so natively the shot's supposed to look like this now our one is actually on the phone like these are not cameras for this i took pictures of em who work on them leyова so be on the phone okay okay sorry yeah it was inокal ishsavandail supposed to look like this. See how it's square now? But I've been cropping it like this because it looks better in the video. Like nobody wants these these black bars right here on the sides. So I crop it like this which means I lose some resolution but this is what it looks like at full resolution which is a square which I guess may be better for social and then this is what I crop it to. Okay the look may be the most important thing. I mean it required a little spray paint but it's perfect. These are my glasses. Camera, no camera, camera, they're and they're Ray-Bans. Perfect! That ending does suck and I do have to reshoot but up to video, the video feels great! I mean I haven't made one of these in so long. It's been two years since I've really been in this city. But it captures everything I wanted it to capture and when I rewind to several lessons ago when I was talking about sort of you know the video of me using the camera. I had to do it and I had to do it. So I'm just going to go ahead and do it and I'm going to go ahead and do it. Intentionality and thinking of a single narrow idea and then thinking of the approach to that idea and then thinking about going out and being really flexible, really open-minded and how you capture that idea. When I think about all of the process that I've spent so much of these lessons examining, I now see all of them in this video that I made. There was a lot here so I'm hoping you can take as much of that as you can possibly remember and take those notes or take those memories and dive in to the rest of your video. You should have hopefully already tackled the first part of it but now as we get into the second act, we get into the third act, we get into the ending, we're having to think holistically. Not just about that setup, not just about the first act but really the big picture. Can you make it all work together? Can you give an ending that is satisfying so when I'm done with your video, I'm going to end it? Would that be OK? I'm going to end the video, I stopped watching and I walk away thinking about it. That is what happens now. Good luck, it's not easy but it is exciting and when you are done is rewarding. There's nothing more pleasing than making something and finishing. And speaking of finishing, the second I finish this, I'm going back to LA so I can finish this video and I'm going to have, video, I'll email it to you. Can you put it at the end of this lesson? They're nodding their heads. It's going to be at the end of this lesson. So that's it for this lesson, but don't go anywhere. My seven minute video that you've already seen in parts a hundred times. This is what it looks like complete. So apparently this is going on here. Huh. The door cam's a GoPro Hero 4. This thing's probably been on nonstop for like six years, seven years. I think I finally killed it. Come on! It still works! Ah, it's better. So apparently Ray-Ban launched a pair of sunglasses. that have a built-in camera. Now I've been known from time to time to wear sunglasses, and I also sometimes use a video camera so this seems like maybe an appropriate product for me. Happy to see the city hasn't gotten any quieter since I've been gone. I'm going to go to the bathroom now. I'm going to go to the bathroom now. I'm going to go to the bathroom now. I'm going to go to the bathroom now. I'm going to go to the bathroom now. Okay, can I have a pair of these? But we don't have this style in store. Okay, they didn't have them there, but I got a phone call while I was in there from a different Sunglass Hut, which is crazy because I didn't give them my phone number. Whatever. I'm going downtown. Gonna get them now. Can I take a quick picture? Alright, I'll take it. Good to be back in the city. I hope they have them. How are you? Nice to meet you. I'm Irving. I'm the store manager here. Irving, thank you so much. Anytime. Irving, I got a question. Yes. How did you get my phone number? Well, I have a caller ID and I have a list of the people that I'm asking for. Oh. Okay, that makes sense. You called here earlier. Okay, okay. I remember you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Nice to meet you. You're the best. Take care. Can I get a picture with you? Yeah, of course, of course, of course. Can I take a picture with you? Yeah, of course. Oh, thank you so much. You back? Not yet. Not yet. Alright. I miss this city, though. Nice. We miss you, too. Oh, my God. Dude, can I get a picture with you? Yeah, totally. Yeah, you're on my vlog. Oh, that's so cool. Bye. Bye, guys. Well, that was an adventure, wasn't it? Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Right off the bat, I see one thing wrong with these. Done. I mean, I think they look pretty good on me. It's the lens right there. Okay, to start a recording I push this button right here. Okay, it's recording. Okay, this next sequence was shot entirely on my sunglasses. And those are sunglasses. Let's go. I gotta go. We're gonna miss our flight. Are you crying? Okay. Let's go. Yes, thank you, sir. You guys have a great flight. Happy weekend. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye bye now. Bye, thanks. Have a good day. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye, Sonny. Hi, Sonny. Hi, Sonny. Hello, my baby. Hey, Georgey. Come on. Let's go inside. Bye, Daddy. Bye, Georgey. Have fun at ballet. Now, every shot you just saw was captured on these glasses. Every image. And, well, the footage comes out great. You can see the glass. The footage kind of sucks. Like that whole travel sequence, I wanted that to be like its own little video, but the footage was so unwatchable, I cut it down. Now, in fairness, I did crop the image. This is what it looks like at full resolution. It's a square for like Instagram. And I cropped it to look like this because these bars here are ugly. The image quality should be at least as good as an iPhone 5. Like this is like whatever, say your old technology. It should have been this good. And it's nowhere near this good. These are my Google Glass from 2012, nine years ago. And this is what that footage looks like. There's no way to look cool when you wear these. They're a little bit like the Segway. And then my friend Sam Sheffer told me to check out these like Snapchat video glasses. Now, I know this isn't really my style, but look at these things. Ready? First of all, the image clear as day, this image. But when I'm like running around and I'm moving like crazy, it's horizon leveling because it's a spherical image. Snapchat. Look how good that is. Facebook, how can Snapchat kick your ass like this? Whatever. I wouldn't recommend buying these yet. They're not really useful because the image is so bad. And I hope maybe in the version twos, you get it right. I'd love a video camera that looks like this. These glasses. Okay. Thanks for watching. Nice to be back on YouTube. I'll see you soon. More videos. Bye.",

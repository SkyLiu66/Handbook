So now that we've used our action scene that you guys just got to shoot as a practice to really nail down how to shoot a normal scenario and make it look extraordinary and not normal, right? Now we're going to move into creating your shot list for your talking scene. And your shot list, simply put, is just the cutaway shot similar to what you just shot, but we're going to be listening to our talking scene that ideally you've already shot. And we're going to be picking out the visuals that match up with the words that you were saying to further tell your story, whether that's a funny story, an Instagram video, YouTube video, whatever it is, this is the same exact technique and principle you can use across all these videos. So let's get into it. So we're going to be synthesizing these techniques. We're going to blend all these different learning exercises into one video. Our talking shot, which is our talking shot, is going to be a video that we're going to be using to help you get the most out of your shot list. So we're going to be using our cutaways, our main A-roll, and our cutaways, or our B-roll footage. And we're going to use the addition of a shot list to help you lock down all of the cutaway shots you need to get. So this shot list can be followed very lightly as just a very rough, you know, outline, or it can be followed very strictly and very heavily, depending on how intricate it is what you're shooting. And like I mentioned, this is great for all different types of videos that you do, whether it's going to be an outline for you to get all the shots that you're needing for your video. And I also wanted to mention that these things can be, you know, done in different orders. Right now we kind of did things in an interesting way where we like shot our talking footage, and there's been different learning exercises. And now we're going to do a shot list to that talking footage. You know, of course, you can do the shot list upfront and do that first, if that makes sense for the video that you're doing. For the course, I try to outlay it, outline it in a way that's very specific. So I'm going to be using the cutaway shot list to help you lock down all of the cutaway shots that you're going to be using. And then I'm going to be using the cutaway shot list to help you outline it in a way that made the most sense for you so that you could like, learn everything as we're going, and then be able to put things where they need to go. But of course, in future projects, and videos that you create, you can outline it and really do it in whatever order works best for you, which can mean starting with your shot list. So it just depends on the project. But let's jump into the shot list that I'm going to be working on that you can do along with me for your talking footage. I'm going to hop into the one for my coffee video that you guys have seen.",

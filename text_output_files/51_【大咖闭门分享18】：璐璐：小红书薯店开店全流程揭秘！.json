    "data": " you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you hello everyone good evening let's wait a few minutes wait for the other friends to come in I'm home today let me share the screen can you hear me? I think so let me share the screen okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay careful careful can you see me? okay okay um okay um I'm sorry you you what happened? um now you don't say it I can't school you have to get your Internet there I think I have a little head. It's normal, right? Okay, we can call in other friends. Mr. Zhu Dao, please notify everyone. Let's start the lecture. Okay, let's start the lecture. Please come in. Okay, I'll post it in the group. Post it in the group. Okay, I'll tell you what I want to say today. If you haven't done e-commerce before, it may be a little difficult to listen to the first time. But it's not difficult. You'll get used to it after two operations. I'll calculate it myself. Because we have always taught you personal IP. If you can do it well with your own IP, I think it's a good thing to do e-commerce. Because to be honest, we still have original IP, right? It's original. We have to write a document. Like now, you do e-commerce. This is really a huge step. It's not easy. Because it's equivalent to not having to create original IP. You can copy it. You can copy it with a lot of effort. It's just a little skillful way to copy it. So if you used to do personal IP, you can make an e-commerce account. Or you have to transform to e-commerce later. It's actually less difficult for you. So today's content is about some of the process of opening a shop. How did you get in? Let's brush up and start. There's a lot of content. Let's brush up and start. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's start. Today's listeners, you can ask if you want to do personal IP and e-commerce in the future, if you want to do both, do e-commerce and e-commerce. Do personal IP and e-commerce. Most of you want to do both. Because this is really a new trend. If you want to do both, I think it's good. Personal IP has a period. For example, we have finished a training camp today. Then the next one will be two days later. In the meantime, what else can you do except paying? You can make your own account. Let's start. Today is the 13th class of the training camp. At the same time, you can listen to the four songs of our mixed-race. This is the whole process of opening a shop. We will talk about this content in three episodes. One episode is definitely not finished. We will talk about some of the things that are not finished. When I was preparing for the class, I followed the logic of the class. I followed the logic of accepting a new thing. So we are talking about the beginning of the training camp. Let me talk about the summer shop. Do you know about summer shop? First of all, the word summer shop is unfamiliar to you. If you know about summer shop, you can type 1. If you don't know about summer shop, you can type 2. What is the function of summer shop? Summer shop is a small shop on your account. If you are a seller, you can use the logic of summer shop to run your store. It is called e-commerce logic. If you are a seller, you can run your store in the e-commerce logic. I am doing this to sell products and make profits. For e-commerce, for students who sell, for students who have personal IP, summer shop is a knowledge payment logic. It is used to hang a low-cost cash flow class or a direct cash flow class. You can go to my small shop and see it. I have two products in it. One is the positive price product of our training camp and the other is the 9.9-dollar cash flow product. What is the purpose of the product? It is to hang it in my notebook and transfer it directly to the effective customers in the market. So these are two logic. For those who sell, you can use e-commerce logic. What is the focus of today's talk? We are talking about e-commerce. How to sell goods? How to sell goods? Especially, we are talking about the e-commerce logic. The e-commerce is like this. You hang the goods, right? Some students have their own goods. You are not called a non-purchaser. You are called a pure e-commerce, which means selling your own products. What is a non-purchaser? I sell other products. So the difference is here. It depends on whether you sell your own products or others. Today, we mainly talk about selling other people's goods. Open a store and sell other people's goods. This is called a non-purchaser e-commerce. To put it bluntly, this is what it means. I don't print goods. What is a non-purchaser? Let me explain it to you again. A non-purchaser is when I go to other platforms to find goods. I don't print goods, I don't print goods, I don't deposit goods, I don't invest money. I just hang a link and you place an order. Then I quietly send goods to you from the third party platform and earn a difference. I will demonstrate it to you. Today, I just recorded a video. I used two examples. After you watch it, you will know how much a non-purchaser earns. How much money he makes. When I was doing it today, I was thinking, if I have more team members, can I do a new business? It is indeed very profitable. If you are a small IP, you will earn more money on the e-commerce. It may not necessarily make you a big IP. But it is possible that you will earn more than that small IP. Let's listen to it. You can hear the sound. This is a video I recorded. Let's listen to it. Let's listen to it. Can you hear it? After you have finished the group, click on the item, then click on the sales, What does it mean? I will give you an example. For example, we chose the type of dress. There are more summer dresses. After finishing the group, click on the item, then click on the sales. What does it mean? The dress is on the whole small IP. The sales rank is the top few items. Look at this dress. It sold 20,000. This one sold 10,000. This one sold 10,000. Let's see how the non-purchaser earns money. It sold 9,000. The price is 89.9 yuan. Let's search other platforms. How to do it? First, we take a screenshot. Open the PNC app. After opening the app, click on the camera. Select the picture. It will automatically locate the picture. After that, click on the sales. It is the same as searching for money on the map. You can do this on any platform. You can see something beautiful on the road. You can search for money on the map. It will come out. Is this picture coming out? Let's see. It is the same model on the red book. How much does it sell? 89.9 yuan. How much is the price on the PNC? 26.89 yuan. This is the price they are charging. Let's see how to earn money. Is it just changing the platform? It is just changing the platform. It is from 89.9 yuan to 26.89 yuan. Let's count. 89.9 yuan minus 26.89 yuan. This is the price of a single item. The profit they can make from the price of a single item. Is it 63 yuan? If I look at the red book, how much did it sell? It sold 9,244. 9 times 9,244. 9 times 9,244. Look at this. The number of money is the amount of money I will get after selling the green chain on the red book. After selling the green chain on the red book, I will get the profit after the volume of my stomach is sold. I will get the profit after the volume of my stomach is sold. The profit of the single item times the volume of my stomach. The higher the profit of the single item, the higher the difference. The higher the sale, the higher the profit. So it is just changing the platform. 89.9 yuan plus 26.89 yuan is the difference times the sale. It is 580,000 yuan. This is an example of the green chain. I just demonstrated the video. Can you get it? Is this method very cool in class? I don't need to come to you live to exchange. I can watch the video and the article. I can watch this thing. A student asked a very good question. What is it called? A student asked a very good question. Let me answer it. A student asked, Li Xue asked, Why don't others go to the green chain? It is so transparent. Can anyone answer this question? Why don't others go to the green chain? It is so transparent. Can anyone answer this question? I will tell you the reason. Business is the essence of information gap. Business is the essence of information gap. Business is the essence of information gap. Because it is a fold in China. Because it is a fold in China. For example, you go to the mall at your door. In the mall, a green chain is sold for more than 300 yuan. One day, you are shopping in the mall or after watching a movie, you go to the mall. You are shopping in the mall. You are shopping in the mall. You buy it. But, is this only 299 yuan? Can't you search the picture and pick up the goods in other places? I will tell you. Many people don't know how to find it. This is the core problem. Because there is a gap in information. For example, I look at a transparent mobile phone case. I look at a transparent mobile phone case. I brush my teeth before I go to bed. I see it. It sells for 19 yuan or 20 yuan. For me, I buy it for 20 yuan. I don't need to go to the online market. I can find it everywhere. Sometimes, some customers don't know how to find it. Many people don't use the app. They don't know how to search for the payment function. They don't know how to find the payment function. They don't know how to find the payment function. This is the core difference. The information gap is not all public and transparent. What you know, he doesn't know. What you know, he doesn't know. Some customers even think he is buying new products in the store. Or he thinks the picture in the box is too low. Maybe he thinks about the good title or the good cover on the book. Maybe he thinks about the good title or the good cover on the book. Then he thinks it's pretty good here. It's pretty cool to place an order. This is the main difference. You go to the store to compare the price. You go to get the goods. You find a reliable supplier. He only needs to place an order through your notes. So there are two logic. He doesn't have to cut the picture down and look for it online. He doesn't have to cut the picture down and look for it online. Some customers don't want to be so troublesome. Especially users on Xiaowangshuang. He is not a user who saves 3 yuan or 5 yuan to compare the price online. He is not a user who saves 3 yuan or 5 yuan to compare the price online. So this is the fundamental difference. This is the fundamental difference. I will give you another example. This is a group of people in a group. Let's look at another one. Let's look at another one. Why don't you go to the same place? Why don't you go to the same place? Do you know when to place your order? Do you know? I searched for earrings at the shop at 69 yuan. I searched for my earrings at this shop. I searched at the shop. I searched, but I don't know the price. I don't know how to compare. I spend a lot of time to buy. So I just buy at this shop. So you can compare the price. So this is the fundamental difference. How do you distinguish over the next time? How do you distinguish over the next time? which of these market members is worth being your source channel. When you search, there are a lot of sources. How do you look at it? There are different methods. There may be five methods. I'll talk to you about it later. For example, how do you look at its sales? How do you look at its evaluation? And how do you judge whether its member is reliable? And so on. I'll talk to you about it next time. So you see, other customers don't know these methods. So they won't judge. So we are in charge of this information gap. We help them judge ourselves. So this is a difference. And what example did I use? Let's give another example. For example, the necklace. The necklace is the top-selling product. This is the necklace. I'll give you another example. For example, the necklace. The necklace is the top-selling product. This is the necklace. There are some popular products on the small book. These products. Let's look down. You see, they all sell more than 10,000 orders. For example, I think this one is pretty good. It sold 30,000 points. Let's see how much it can make. Let's make a screenshot. And the same. Search here. Click on this. Click on the camera. Click on the camera. Click on the bottom left corner. And then select the screenshot you just made. It will automatically identify it. Right? You see, this is. If you buy from this platform. If you buy from this platform. How much is it? Right? How much is it if you buy from this platform? Let's see. Maybe this price is only 1.7 yuan. Only 1.7 yuan. OK. Then let's see how much it sells. It sells 15.9 yuan. Right? Mark 49. Sells 15.9 yuan. Then how much does it make? Count it. Count it. 15.9 minus 1.7. 15.9 minus 1.7. OK. This is one product. It makes 14 yuan. How many orders does it sell on the small book? Look at it. Sold 30,000 orders. Right? Sold 30,000. Here. 30,000 orders. OK. Multiply 30,000. OK. This is 460,000. This is 426,000. 426,000. This is the product. If it is sold on the small book, it will be sold out, right? I made a dozen dollars on a single order. I sold 30,000. Then I can finally make 426,000. So much. Right? So this is the whole Wu Huoyuan's way. It's through the middleman to make a difference. Such a mode. At the same time, add our content bar. Break this bottle. Then through this difference. Multiply by sales. It will eventually be your profit. OK. This is a way of Wu Huoyuan. OK. This is a way of Wu Huoyuan. OK. This is a way of Wu Huoyuan. This is a way of Wu Huoyuan. OK. This is a way of Wu Huoyuan. Then the next one, we will also tell everyone what you should pay attention to when choosing a product. For example, some people wear logos or some people wear black labels. Right? You can't choose. Or for example, Chanel's. Dior's. This kind of brand. Then you can't choose. Then you choose some things that are not in business. It's a brand-less thing. To put it bluntly, everyone can sell it. To put it bluntly, the goods of the world may all be taken from the same house. Everyone will buy it. This is the way of Wu Huoyuan. OK. This is a way of Wu Huoyuan. OK. This is a way of Wu Huoyuan. OK. This is a way of Wu Huoyuan. OK. This is a way of Wu Huoyuan. This is a way of Wu Huoyuan. This is a way of Wu Huoyuan. OK. About how to buy and take pictures. I'll talk about this in the next lesson. I'll tell you first. You don't have to buy goods in the first stage. When you haven't made money yet, you don't have to buy goods. Use the second edit of the material first. Then go do it. Then after you finish it, wait until you order it. For example, I have already earned 300 yuan. There's already a discount. Then you can buy it. You can buy it. Then you can buy it. Then you can buy it. Then you can buy it. Then you can buy it. Then you can buy it. Then you can buy it. Then you can buy it. Then you can buy it. Then you go do it. Then after you've done it, you wait until you deliver your order. For example, I have already earned 300 yuan. Ten customers have already placed orders. I have already earned 300 yuan. At this point, I'm having a few p Extra balance. Irar a civ. Buy a product and come back and try it out. Is this product good? Right? Or, for example, I've seen 10 orgams. I've seen 10 owned orgams. I think they are all good. Then we all have conducted the order. Con Goggle, then come back to the store and compare. Maybe these stores are the best ones. Are these stores' delivery slices right? Right I keep him. I'll use this store to work with him next time. as my upstream channel, and I'll return all the rest. This is what you can do after you make money. Then I don't recommend you to start shooting with a real-time picture. Because the way of playing the game of the no-borrowers is not to buy one product, but to buy 20 products. It's a personal IP, which means I create and produce it myself. But the way of playing the game of the no-borrowers is to put a lot of products on it, and then which one is the first order, which one is the last order. It's possible that you've put 10 of them on, and only one of them is the last one. Then you'll focus on doing this one. You take that one back, and then you take a good shot, and then you pass it on. Right? So this is the back of the story. But at the beginning, you don't need to come up, you take every picture yourself. You don't need to, you know. Do you see any of these? This is the picture that's used all over the Internet, you know. The whole network uses this picture. I'll show you how to operate the whole picture. And then I'll show you again. Look at the small red book. Now there are no-borrowers one after another. Is the first one to send a signal? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Just send it. And then you see this is these two. You see, this is the note. This is what I told you about the goods. How to go to see it. How does this work with notes? After he finished a note, he put a document on it. After the traffic was burst through the content bar, Then someone will directly click on the shopping cart below his note to place an order. You see, this is a cheese. You see, it's three pictures. See? Three pictures. And then it's sold out. More than 1,300 orders. Assuming a single profit is five dollars. Then he sold this one and made five thousand. Look at this again. This is also three pictures. It's also three pictures. It's also three pictures plus a few lines. And then sold 120,000. Assuming his profit is five dollars or three dollars. Right? Then he may have earned four or five thousand by this product. But let me tell you something. He made this four or five thousand. It's not through a notebook. Can you understand? He's hanging it on his store. His store has a total sales of 130,000. He sent ten to twenty notebooks. To reach this sales. Can you understand this point? Not to say that one notebook hangs a shopping cart. Then he just. This one notebook brought him a little 30,000. No, he's selling it again and again. Sell again and again. Can you understand this? It's like I hang one of my little classes. I hung a little class with a notebook. It's not that I just use this one notebook to sell all my little classes. I hang it every time I update my work. I hang it every time I update. Can you understand this? Okay, and then look at another one. This is a pajamas. Yes, several notebooks all have the same product. You see this is a pajamas. You see this is three or four pictures. Four or five pictures. Four or five pictures. This should be. He didn't come from another platform. He might be a ten-shot. I bought it myself. Ten shots. Not bad. You see the sales of two thousand. Nearly three thousand. Nearly three thousand and eighty-eight dollars. He might take the price of thirty. Fifty dollars. Fifty dollars of profit. How much is it multiplied by? Three thousand units. Then you can calculate how much it is. Right? Okay, and then these are all pictures. These are all pictures. These three are all pictures. And then this is a video form. Take a look at it. This is a video form. It's about 15 seconds. Okay, 15 seconds. That video. I'm going to go. Hey, yeah. I don't stop. You buy my love. I'm going to go. Yeah, I'm going to go. I'm going to go. Hey, yeah. You can walk. I'm going to go. This is a six thousand. Six thousand. Twenty-nine dollars. I guess the price of the goods. It's about twelve dollars. Let's assume ten dollars. Just a little bit less. Assuming the price difference is ten dollars. He also brought him a 50,000-dollar profit. A profit of nearly 60,000 dollars. All right. This is the whole one. The status of a non-public employee. It's the whole platform. There are fewer people doing it now. All right. What kind of people are suitable for a non-public employee? It's mainly suitable for three types of people. The first type of person is that we take students. Many, many students. That's what we've been giving you before. It's also a painful point. What is it? We've also taught how to do traffic. I've also taught this and that. But he's always not making money. Or he's always unable to make a result. Where is the reason? The reason is that he doesn't want to show his face. There's no special feature. What about these people? He's on the way to IP. It's hard for him to go, isn't it? You think you're an English teacher yourself. You're a teacher. Then you can do it casually. But some students. He doesn't show his face. He doesn't want to show his face. Second, he has no special features. And then the third one doesn't want to do IP. He can't do the job payment. So what is it that he's more suitable for? There's a new version now. It's suitable for everyone to do. It's a non-public employee. You don't want to show your face. You want to, for example, when you watch your child. Or when you go to work, get off work, and go home. Right? You can go to Wu Huoyuan. Cut the video. Second edit. Then quickly send it. This is faster. Okay, that's the first type of person. What's the second type of person? It's me. You buy it yourself. You're interested in buying it yourself. You like to play when you're free. So this thing is for you. It's one of your daily lives. For example, you like earphones. Then you make a video type. Right? You make a video type. You like to buy it yourself. People who are interested in e-commerce themselves. What else is suitable? I don't have any goods. I don't have any goods at home. And I don't want to spend money to buy goods. Then it's suitable for Wu Huoyuan. Like many of our founders' IPs. Maybe he's the video editor himself. It's the clothing editor. Then he may not need to be Wu Huoyuan. He can just do e-commerce. If you don't have your own goods. You can only sell other people's goods. Right? Then selling other people's goods is Wu Huoyuan. So this is more suitable for these three types of people. What to sell? Is there any trick? Just choose what you like. I'll recommend a few categories to you. Then what's the key? One is that you like it. The other is that you are familiar with this category. For example, you are a person who never buys clothes. You are a person who never buys clothes. Then you do that kind of women's clothing. Is it more difficult for you? Because you don't know what the current popular style is. You don't know. Is it popular this year? Is it popular this year? You don't have that feeling. You don't have that feeling. It's a little bit difficult for you to do it. Right? So try to do it from your own. Start with your own good content. You can do more other things. Which one is better? Okay, then I'll come back to it. Why do you want to be a member of Wu Huoyuan? That's the advantage of the whole Wu Huoyuan. Okay, can you see this now? Can you see my thought guide? Can you see it? Can you see it? You can take a picture. Take a picture and post it in our group of people in the Red House. Or in our training camp group. You can play a wave. If you hear it and you get it, you can play a wave. Full of income, okay? You can play in the Red House group. Then play a wave of full income. Play a wave of full income. Come back and listen again. Move it. Play in our Red House or training camp group. Play in the Red House or training camp group. Move other students who haven't listened to the class. Make them feel like they're wasting it. Right? Right? Okay, that one. One stop. One stop. Okay, you can play a wave. Then we'll talk about it. What are the advantages of Wu Huoyuan? First of all, the first one. That's what we're talking about. From the perspective of the whole platform, the whole trend of the Red House. The first trend of the Red House is that it has a strong consumption capacity. You should all be familiar with this. People aged 20 to 35. Then the high-level female group in the first and second line. Right? So it also confirms what I said earlier. That is, this group of people don't want to compare themselves. He doesn't have that time to compare. You know? He's not talking about the kind of. Buy a three or five dollars. You have to get the money. You have to get the money to buy food. These groups of people who want to get a few cents. He's not talking about. The mother group is the one who's collecting. What is this? His face-to-face user group is these high-level groups. High-level user female group. I didn't give you an example before. Dong Jie's live broadcast room. The average transaction is 3,000. One user. It's going to cost 3,000 yuan to be in his live broadcast room overnight. That's exaggerated. Right? So he's going to do it for a 19 or 12-dollar earring. Go around and compare. He won't. Right? He won't. This is a consumer. Strong ability. So he's not good at comparing. So it's ours. We're going to compare. Right? We're going to do a comparison. So what's the second one? It's good for the brand. Because the platform is going to complete the whole of the grass to the grass. The internal wall. So what's the third point? The platform is supporting e-commerce in large numbers. Because I've said it many times before. He's always been supporting content. Content content. But he doesn't have e-commerce. Yeah, he doesn't have e-commerce. He doesn't have this. This one. I want to say this company. His profit is not very high. There's no high Douyin. So he's going to do a trend strategy. That is to say, I'm going to support e-commerce. So he started to flow into the live broadcast room. He started to flow into the works of the hanging car. He started to give all kinds of stores. The red power. Not to you. It's not to check you. Not to check you. Anything can be on the shelf. Right? Just for the platform. Close your eyes. What is the red power? What is the red power? Just start to open one eye. Close your eyes. This is called red power. Everything is reliable. It's all that kind of one-to-one. It's already hard at this point. That is, you have to go to something. You have to brand. You have to be qualified. You have to read books. You have to take tax. You have to do this. All kinds of insurances. A bunch of insurance. When the full-fledged of what the positive is. He doesn't have ordinary red power. You know what? The red power means that his platform is not as strict as you. Anyone can do it. So it's red power. Right? So now it's a red flag. So what's the fourth reason? There are fewer professional players. Because most people are still rolling Douyin. Still rolling Douyin. So the entire business platform. They mostly put their core team power on Douyin. So it leads to less price on the red book. Less price on the book. And then the overall professional player is less. So he's less competitive. If you imagine. If one of those people doesn't do it. One of those people is not doing it. I can't eat a bite. These people are aware of Douyin. When it's no longer profitable. They started to sign all the teams. At a certain time. At this time, the regular army came. Various car hangings. Various operations. When all the operating teams are on. Ordinary people don't have a chance. Now it's because of this wave of people. Still on another platform. Eat the other platform's long tail traffic. They haven't finished eating that wave. Right? So people don't like this piece of cake. People have to do it. If you want to get a hundred million. Or how many thousands do they have? I don't like the little red book. At this time. Little red book. This little cake. Can we eat it first? Right? So this is a trend for the whole platform. So let me talk about the second point. Is the low investment cost. Low investment cost. First of all. It's not like a treasure. Right? You need to pay for a product. You brush the order. What? First of all, you don't need to brush the order. Second, you don't need any investment. Third, you don't need any pressure. Zero investment. Right? What else? The guarantee is extremely low. The guarantee doesn't even require you to go up to ten thousand. This one. The guarantee only needs one thousand. You can turn on the electricity. And you can pay in advance. When you want to raise the line. When you want to raise the line. You go to pay. Or your store's profit is already very high. The official wants to remind you to go to the stock market. When you are in the stock market. You go to pay. So he can say it's starting. Starting up electricity is almost zero cost. This is not on the whole network. Not even on the whole network. All right. Not even on the whole network. So the investment cost is low. You can play a wave. Low investment cost. You can play a wave in the comments area. It's called low investment cost. After playing, we'll go down. Okay. What's the third one? The advantage of no exchange is called low risk. Low risk. That is, the whole thing. I told you. The whole platform is looking at you. Close your eyes. As long as you don't do anything illegal. It's too serious. He doesn't care about you. He doesn't care about you. Right? So the platform is almost without illegal fines. At most, he'll judge you. Say you're what? You're illegal. You have to remind you. Right? Remind you. He won't say to fine you. What? Just shut down the shop for you. Just deduct your deposit. Just fine you. This one. No. He's just giving you a message later. Say a product has been sold. Because of the non-regulation. And then the over-publicization. Or use someone else's logo. This one. Right? He might just do this. So he doesn't have any fines. No fines. You just have to be in normal. In a legal range. Without too much of a margin. He doesn't care about you. What's the other one? The refund period is short. The refund period is relatively short. T plus 7. This user. After he gets the money. You can go to the cashier in 7 days. So the refund period is very short. You can start the week. The week of funds. This is the third point. It's called low risk. Let's play the third one. It's called low risk. Low risk. Okay. The fourth one. Let's play a wave. Low risk. Then we'll talk about the fourth one. What's the fourth one? Low difficulty operation. Low difficulty operation. I just said it at the beginning. Personal IP. When you go to do e-commerce again. It's a downgrade. Because for us. From a topic to a text. To a title. To a cover. To all our videos. All of them are original. But. Do e-commerce. Do that. What? No source. You don't need to do original. You almost don't need to be original. You're original. You're already. I'm going to give you a big song. It's normal for you not to be original. Right? So he's a notebook. Material transportation. Plus a second cut. All kinds of mixed cuts. And use some editing techniques. To avoid the review of the platform. And so on. This kind of operation. You almost don't need to be original. Even the title. You can use our. What? Kneading method. Right? You can use A for the material. And then. The title. Use a C. Right? And then knead it. Knead it into your one piece. Because of this. Because of this e-commerce. He said. He's not like personal IP. There's a clear IP attribute in there. He's actually selling. Selling. Selling. Right? So he's not that strong. The requirement for your original. Okay. This is our whole. One advantage of no-pay. It's a notebook. Manual. Second cut. No need to be original. And low risk. Low investment cost. And the gene of this platform is good. Okay. So when we do no-pay. What do you need? If you do no-pay. Are you from the same chain? On the chain. You need these links. Right? First. You have to do no-pay. First of all, you have to open a store, right? Okay. After opening the store. Is it going to be a selection? Which product do I want to go on? On this phone case. Or this phone case. Am I going to choose? Okay. The second step is called selection. What do you do after choosing? To go on the shelf. Right? The third step. What do you do after the shelf? Is it going to start to send notes? When you send notes. Go through the notes to hang up the car. Send notes. Okay. Send notes. Then hang up the car. Right? Then after hanging up the car. There is this exposure. Someone is on your store. Are you going to start to connect the shop to do the post? This is our whole process. Then I will go around this whole process. To tell you. Today we focus on how to open a store. How to go on the shelf. Then next time we go to class. We may have to talk about how to choose. How to choose a product. It's very important. And how to send notes. How to do the original or the original note. Then maybe there will be another class. Tell everyone how to talk to the merchant. How to talk to the merchant. How to do some tailoring. This is our overall logic. Personal IP. We said it at the time. Personal IP and client number are two numbers. It doesn't matter. Two numbers. Not in the same number. You can't say. At the same time, I am a personal IP. I teach self-media. At the same time, I have that store. At the same time, I sell toothbrushes on my number today. I sell that. No. The e-commerce number is the e-commerce number. The IP number is the IP number. Two numbers. Understand? Okay. Then we will talk about it next. What are the steps needed for the entire e-commerce without a merchant? We are going to talk to you in a minute. Let's talk about the first step. Turn on the power. Okay, let me ask you. When should we turn on the power? You can turn it on now. You can turn on the power after you turn on the signal. Okay. You have already turned on the power. There is no power call yet. Let me take a look. Haven't you turned it on yet? Not yet. Okay, let me take a look. Okay, let's talk about the process of turning on the power. Let me tell you how to turn on the power. How to do it. Wait a minute. I'll turn it on. Okay, it will be clearer at this time. Is this class great? You can see me again. You can see the back again. Okay, let me tell you. Little red book store. I'll divide it into two categories. One is a personal store and the other is an enterprise store. I don't recommend using the enterprise store. We use the personal store the most. Then I'll talk about the personal store. Personal store, our ID card. If you are a private store, then the ID card is registered. Registered on the day, passed on the day. Then your little red book store name is your store name. Your little red book store name is your store name. Let me exit and show you how to turn on the power. Let's take a look at how to turn on the power. Can you operate this? Can you operate this? How to turn on the power. Click on your upper left corner. Then look at the creative center. Then click on more services. Then click on open store. See? Click on the creative center. Then click on more services. Here. After this, click on open store. Is this page done? No requirements. No requirements. It's basically this page, isn't it? Then take a look at this page. I'll zoom in. Okay, this page is about different types. Okay, let's see which stores are there. Is there a personal store? Personal stores, you only need an ID card. Which other individual industrial stores? Individual industrial stores need you to have that business card. Right? And there are ordinary business stores. Maybe you need to have a company ID card. Then this special store, the flagship store is more difficult. Right? It may need to be a brand authorization below. Business, business, business, operator identity, etc. Right? So the simplest way. I also recommend the way to you. It's a personal store. Just choose this category. If you have more questions when you open the store. I'll tell you how to find it. See? Right upper corner. When you enter this page, right upper corner. Hey? When you enter this page, there is a how to open the store option in the upper right corner. Did you see this button? You can see more detailed answers when you go in. For example, you can find it by clicking on the check answer. For example, what kind of product to choose to operate? How much can you open a few stores? Blah blah blah. These more detailed things. You don't understand. You can go in and find it. You can go in here and find it. Then you probably go to this step. Click on the personal store. Is it going to enter the next link? It's going to this link. It's going to this store application link. What are you doing at this time? Upload your ID. Upload your name. Your ID. Then. You can check your face and fill in your phone. Then you can log in immediately on the day. You can turn on the power immediately. This is the whole process of opening the store. This is the whole process of opening the store. If you want to know more, Just click on the upper right corner. How to open the store to look at more information. All right. All right, I'll continue to talk about this. All right, this personal store. Personal stores are just how we demonstrated how to open it. Right? All right, then I'll say a few more things that you should pay attention to. It's your ID. Register on the day. Open on the day. Then what's the point of attention? The name of the small red book is your store name. For example, my name is Lu Lu is a road. So my store is called Lu Lu is a road to the store. Understand? For example, your little red book name is called. What's the name? Called Aichi Video. Then your store name is called Aichi Video. Got the power. Understand? It's your little red book name. Hey, my, my, my. Wait a minute. I'm going to charge my power. Why is mine out of power? Wait a second. Wait a second. Okay. Hey, it seems to be out of power. Okay, I'll talk about it. Keep talking. Okay, the name of the little red book is your store name. So your signal, your signal, you have to change the name. Because you just registered the signal. Do you remember? You just registered a signal. Are you a little sweet potato or something? Do you remember? When you just registered, you called it a little sweet potato or something. Hey, everyone, wait a minute. Let me see. It seems to be the same. If you don't remember it, then I killed him. So my signal Your signal should be the same. Your signal will say the smile when you see it. Is that it? Does this signal look different? Oh, The color reminds me of you. It's like you're a little warm. I may need to charge my phone. Please wait a moment. Oh, there's power. I'll be out of power in a minute. Okay, I'm back. I'm back. I'm back. Okay, now it's just the light. Okay, the computer is charged. Okay, everyone, wait a moment. Let's take another 666. Everyone just waited a moment. I'll continue to talk later. Everyone, take another 666. We'll continue to talk later. Okay, I'll continue to talk later. Maybe my person will be a little dark. Okay, everyone, do you know that after you open the store, you will have a something something power. For example, you are called Yaya. Then your store is called Yaya's store, right? So everyone should pay attention. When you call, you must change the name. Otherwise, you may call it little sweet potato 6415926 something something. Right? Then you will become a little sweet potato 123456789 power. Do you think people will order in this store? Will they? So your name must be changed to a professional name. Then to enhance your conversion rate. Everyone knows it, right? For example, if you make a video, you can call it a love video, right? If you do the same, you can write a same-pages supply chain, right? In this way, people will point you. Is it more likely to order at your store? Can you understand this point? Then I'll show you. Look, for example, what is this person called? Look, for example, this person is called. Look, this person is called a love video. See? Right? So his store is called a love video store. Then you see what this person is called. This name is even better. This name is even better. This name is even better. This name is even better. This name is even better. What is this called? This is called a same-pages supply chain. See? His own name is called a same-pages supply chain. If it were me, I would choose this woman's makeup. You are a popular woman's makeup supply chain, right? Or what? Video source supply chain. As long as your name is not illegal, you can go up. You just call this name. Then someone else will point to your account, right? You just call what supply chain. Then point to your store. You call a same-pages supply chain store. You just want to come to this kind of store to order. You think, oh, you see, supply chain must be cheap, right? Isn't it just this feeling? This is the advantage of the name. The advantage of the name is that you can create a name with a conversion rate. Just go to create a conversion rate. So I said the number of e-commerce and the number of personal IP. It's just two characters. Can you understand this? It feels like the beginning, doesn't it? It feels like a store that can be very popular, right? Okay, and then this point. I'm here. What is the point you should pay attention to? You have to go to the little red book first. Search for that name. Is there a repetition? For example, you want to call that Aichi video. Then you have to search in that search box for Aichi video. Then click on a user. After clicking on the user, if the whole network has the same name, you must modify it. Why? Although the little red book number can be the same name, the store cannot be the same name. For example, it is impossible to think that there are two stores at the same time. It's called the same-pages supply chain, right? It can only have one. If A has written this name, you can't write it anymore. Can you understand this? Just if you say. There is already a store called Aichi video. You can't call it. So when you are calling your little red book name, you just go to search for Aichi video. Is there a similar user with the little red book name? If so, you change a name. If you want to be exactly the same as others, if you want to register a store again, your store cannot be approved. Because there is already a store called Aichi video. Can you understand this point? Can you cover it? And then the system will remind you to modify it. But you modify it for seven days. That is, you can only change your name after seven days. Think about it. If you don't know, you may have a name. Then apply for a seven-day registration and then modify it again. You submitted another one. He said he was registered again and then modified it for seven days. You said you had been there for half a month. Isn't it a big deal? Right? So you have to pay attention. When you start naming, we search in advance. Do you know how to search? Do you know how to search? Can you understand how to search? When you usually search for that name, search for Aichi video, and then click on the user. If there is a user who is exactly the same as you, you can search for Aichi video. I'm the same as you, so I can't. Is this point understandable? Do you know how to search? Do you understand how to search for coat? The store name has been set up. You can change it. Can change. Well, for example, I said Lulu was an fat guy, right? Lu Lu is a fat guy. Then I'll click on the user. Look, that's it. After finishing searching, you can't expose it. You search for the user after you've finished searching. This is the whole internet with you. Right? You see if you sign up. Try not to be like others. Right? To prevent this from happening Okay, this point reminds everyone Okay, that's about it Then another one is individual business owners And then what else What else is an enterprise store I don't recommend using enterprises Enterprise stores, for example, what ordinary enterprise stores Enterprise stores, special stores, joint stores He needs you to provide all kinds of procedures and qualifications He's a trouble So you must know that Business people are like this Can do small don't do big Because of what You do a flagship store You do a mess What kind of store Good to fight A check first is these people to cover You're a little bit of a mess No one cares about you Can you understand Close the door and tell everyone It's a little bit of a mess This kind of place no one cares about you But if you go up to this individual store What kind of store is this You're behind Maybe from time to time Let you make up for what procedures Let you pay something Then and then you have to check Then this one Maybe you have to do this Because everything is big Right? Get big first Right? So when you can do small Go small first Small big little trouble Secretly Secretly do Right? So I don't see anyone using the enterprise store You just use your personal store That's enough Just what I just said This is our大概 The process of opening a store The whole opening is just like this That's it You just open it Okay, what are you going to do after you open the store To set up There are a lot of attention to be paid at this time You see so many secrets Okay, be careful at this time I'll click on it and talk to you There's a lot of content behind this Let me tell you about it Backstage basic facilities Okay, take a look at a background of a basic facility Well, take a look What's the first There's a playback What's the first thing you have to listen to You have to listen to it after you've followed it today I'm telling you there's a lot of operations behind it Everyone listen to it once It's definitely not a get First you have to set up your store Your store has been registered After registration Is it necessary to set up the settings in your store So how do you set it up First you have to pay the guarantee It's the $1,000 that you can pay in advance But I just pay it myself I just pay it directly Right?

Then you can pay it You can also not pay Pay it later But I suggest everyone If you want to do it big Still have to stir it Otherwise, it's not convenient to raise the line or something Anyway, 1,000 yuan is like this It's when you cancel the store He'll pay you back He's just a deposit Just a deposit All right He didn't say he'd give you 1,000 dollars That's it Know that Okay, do you know how to do this?

Know how to operate It's over when you call Okay, and then I'll talk about it again After you've finished the deposit We're going to choose a payment method What does payment mean When I buy from your store Does he support me using Alipay or WeChat? Ah, if you want to open it up Right? Payment method Alipay and WeChat all open up Where does Alipay open up? Let's take a look Still this page Point point what point this fund Then point one I'll take a look at where this is Payment fund Okay, let me show you where I'm paying for the loan fund Let me show you Okay, this is my page Fund and then point loan fund See this is my background My background, right?

If you want to pay, just click on the pay line Click on the pay line, click on the pay line Right? This is your one That that that that platform Okay, I'll just jump back and talk about it Okay, Payment treasure Payment treasure is when you open it up You can open it up as soon as you register Why don't you need this You pay or not pay the deposit This payment method of the payment Can be opened How do you open WeChat? WeChat is like this Open the next day Can't open on the same day That is, after you register the store today Immediately this user can use the payment treasure Pay you the money But WeChat has to be the next day He can And what does WeChat require You have to pay the deposit to open Like me at the time I didn't pay that $1,000 deposit Then I can I'm on the shelf On the shelf My $9.9 class Then others can buy But he can only pay me through the payment treasure He can't use WeChat Then I looked at the background WeChat can't pay I said I'll turn this feature on I'll turn this feature on Just After turning this feature on I can go He can use his WeChat to pay the money Right? But everyone pay attention to WeChat You have to pay the deposit Only if you pay the deposit If you don't pay the $1,000 deposit He won't allow you to pay WeChat Know that So this is to pay attention Another point What do you pay attention to Is that you bind the payment treasure account WeChat account and bank account He is going to be with you The identity certificate of the little red book is the same person What does that mean If it's me My little red book account The ID of the citizen is my ID Then when I open the store Payment treasure account WeChat account bank account Must be my account Can't say it's my shop Then I mentioned it to someone else No way It must be the whole thing It's all you You open your own shop Leave your money to yourself This is his unification This is what the price requires Must be bound to the same person If you say you use your parents' ID Then you have to bind the payment treasure account WeChat account bank account It must be your parents' account It's the same person The same system Can you cover this Can you understand this payment method Can you understand the words of the Kui Bo Yi Can you operate your phone I suggest you use your computer to operate Whoever you want to do the project Let's still take some attitude You have to operate with that computer It's a hassle to operate with that phone You know You can also lose your address if you operate your phone You can log in through Baidu But it's a hassle The phone interface is too small, isn't it Including you have to pay no payment You have to put the goods on one button Do you still have to use the computer It's okay to lose that phone But is it a hassle It's a hassle, you know It's still a computer Know not Okay, can you understand We'll talk about this in the future This is a risk-free Can you understand If you can understand Kui Bo Yi Can you understand Kui Bo Yi Okay, everyone Still not Can understand Okay Can you understand Right Okay In the case of understanding Let's talk about this later This guarantee is over The payment method is over Next, let's talk about the risk of transportation The risk of transportation Everyone who has bought something in Taobao knows it It's what he wrote behind him What is this Self-duty risk Or some of them are in the risk of transportation Not in the risk of transportation So we as girls If you buy something It must be thinking In case I want to buy a dress I have to return if it doesn't fit So I suggest The function of this transportation risk Everyone is best to open Especially what you do What kind of video content What shoes What clothes This is possible In the case of a return Then you have to prevent users from going Worried about not getting off the list Right So you have to put this The function of transportation risk Opened to him I suggest everyone to open Then how to open Everyone goes to this after-sales Then click on the transportation fee That's it Let me show you this picture See no After-sales Then click on the transportation fee Then click on the open full-time service That's it I'll show you I'll show you Log into my background Okay, this is my background See See This is my notebook background Then click on the after-sales Then see After-sales Then click on a transportation fee See This is the time Because I have my own main account I'm doing knowledge payment I don't need transportation risk If you are that physical Right You are selling goods Then you have to point I agree to read Then open the full-time service That's it So what's the benefit of opening transportation risk It's very clear in the first place Take a closer look The first one is that you can increase your conversion rate That's what I said There will be doubts when you get off the list If you don't have that If you don't have that return or transportation fee Others may not get off the list Right Maybe you think that I have the same product I'll go to the one with transportation risk I'll make a reservation So you have to open the first point after opening Is to help you increase the conversion rate You can increase it by about 18% I'll zoom in Can you see it clearly Can increase the conversion rate of 18% What else can I do Can help you increase traffic Because there is a return on the product interface There is that The transportation risk mark It will show you in the search first For example, at the same time I search for a video You both have this video on Then you have transportation risk You will be in the video interface first To show in this product interface Because the platform is also for I want to show that there is a transportation risk It's better to have sales, right? What else can reduce the dispute Right, reduce the dispute Then pay him seven dollars See no pay him seven dollars Okay, then take a look If you have transportation risk What is the interface like below See no Can you see this clearly If you have transportation risk It will write below Proof of ownership and then refund Package transportation fee See here Then look at this side This seems to be impossible to see If you are in the business interface See no If you have transportation risk It will show you first What else If you hang a shopping cart in the live broadcast room Did you see this If you have transportation risk It will mark it This is also useful in the live broadcast room To convert This is the whole The importance of transportation risk So the transportation risk How to get the specific transportation risk What what what There will be detailed introductions later Anyway, what is it? It will pay the customer seven dollars Then each order He will have a zero point five cents It seems that we can take a look I don't have it You see if you open it Your estimated service fee is zero point one three dollars Every order It means that you sell one You only need to pay a dime You only need to pay a dime You can open this service Its cost is very low Because I just counted Maybe a profit product You may have a profit Assume you have a profit of fifty dollars You just spend a dime Right You can raise your transfer rate It's worth it It's worth it Okay, let's talk about it later Let's talk about it later The shipping fee is over Then we talk about this later Okay, let's talk about logistics Okay, let's talk about logistics Logistics is very, very important Listen carefully to everyone Logistics is that you have to be in this order Select logistics tools Then fill in your shipping address Just fine It doesn't matter where you ship it Just fill in your own You see the order Then click logistics tools See it? You fill in your own address Because it must require you to have a shipping address You like me Even if it's a virtual product I also have to have a shipping address You just have to have it anyway You just fill it in Anyway, you don't send it from your own place But you fill in your own He will think you sent it from this location Can everyone understand If I fill in Beijing's Haidian District The other party will think If he orders from me I sent it from this address But actually I must have sent it from the source Okay, this is the order logistics Then fill in the shipping address Let me show you a little bit Here, do you see the order? Order and then click logistics tools See it And then this is what you can add Your address And then there's another point What to pay attention to Receipt address is very important Why is the receipt address important Think about it Why is the receipt address important Did you answer this question Why is a refund address important Think about it Think about why the return address is important. This point is very important. Think about why. Think about why. Can anyone answer? Why is the return address important? You must pay attention to the return. Don't give the real address. Because the address of the delivery is different. Right? If you return the address and write your own words, then the user will not be satisfied after he buys this product. If he calls Shunfeng to come to pick up the goods, he will directly return it to you. He will return it directly according to the return address. So the return will be returned to you. If it is returned to you, you have to return it to the source. Right? So the return address must not be given to the real address. So there is a very clever way. A very tricky point. Remember how to do it. Since you want to fill in the address, but he can't give you a real address. What do we do at this time? Come on, give us a very tricky point. Everyone remembers. Click on the order, click on the logistics tool, then click on the new address, right? Click on the new return address. Did you see it at this time? The contact person still writes himself. Then the mobile phone number also fills in his own. But your address does not write your own. In order to prevent him from directly returning it, we must give him a wrong address or not give him an address. How do we fill it? Our national region wants to choose a Hong Kong, Australia, Taiwan. For example, choose China, Hong Kong, right? China, Taiwan. At this time, he will definitely not say that I will send the package to Taiwan, right? What is the other one called? Detailed address. You don't write your actual address, but write it. If you need to return the goods, the detailed return address must be consulted and overcome. Yes, you can keep your mobile number. If he wants to call you, he will call you if he wants to return the goods. Well, well, did you see it? This is the one. This is the most important point. One is the address. Fill in a Hong Kong, Australia, Taiwan address to prevent him from sending it back directly. Another detailed address column. The detailed address column can't be empty, right? It can't be empty. He has a signal. It can't be empty. Then we will tell him to return the goods. Detailed return address. Please consult the customer service. At this time, if he wants to return the goods, he can't send it directly to you. He can only ask the customer service how to send it. Please send me an address. Then he will send it. This is understandable, right? What is the other point? If you have 10,000 orders, like if you have a report, if you have 10,000 orders, if there are 1,000 customers giving you a return every day, you can't send it to everyone. There is another way at this time. What is it called? Use multiple addresses to return goods. You can link different products to different customer return locations. What does it mean? He has a creative strategy. After creating a strategy, you can choose a return address and then you can link the goods. I'll show you. I'll show you on my backstage. For example, here, see? Order, then click logistics tools. Isn't this my address? This is my delivery address, right? Delivery default or return default. You can choose here. At this time, I want to add an address. Add an address is a return address. Just like I just said, right? I choose one. What is China? I choose a Hong Kong, Taiwan, right? China, Hong Kong, then say, please consult me. Right? Please consult me. What? Something like that. Just like I said, fill it in. Fill it in and submit it. What happens after submitting? What happens after submitting? After submitting, you just select the place just now as default return. This is the operation we just talked about. But if I have too much goods, for example, I'm getting older, I have sent 10,000 pieces, of which 1,000 pieces need to be returned. 10% return rate. I want to return 1,000 pieces. I go to the shopping mall one by one. I'm exhausted. I have to connect it to a return address manually. Right? What can we do? Look here. There is an option called multi-digit return. Can you see it? Multi-digit return. After you click on a multi-digit return, we can click on the creation strategy. At this time, I have created a strategy. For example, AA. Right? AA. Then return address. I'll fill in something like this. A default return address. This return address is what you and your seller want. For example, all the pearls in your video are all from this person. Then your return address will fill in this person's. Then you go to connect. Connect your products. Right? All of them. All of them. All of your pearl products are connected. Understand? That is, if you want to return to his home, all your products. Do you see the hook here? All connected. Right? After connecting, Click on one. Click on one to confirm. That's it. In this case, If, But if it's a pearl earring user who needs to be returned, He'll all return to that price automatically. Right? But if you're in that necklace. What? What? Butterfly necklace. That's right. You're from B. B. B. Then you put the return address of B home. Re-create. After creating it, Go back to the link. Right? Add products. Then put all the things about that necklace. All of them are connected to him. Then click on confirm. So, So, You don't need to manually return the goods. This point is, Can you understand? Our first method is to manually return the goods. He wants to consult you. Then you need to manually communicate with him. Communicate. There's another way. That's what we just demonstrated. What's it called? More address return. If, For example, I opened a video store. I have five of them in total. Ah, One is French. Then there is one earring. One is a necklace. One is a bracelet. Right? There are a few stores. Then I created four addresses. Look, He can have more addresses here. He can have more addresses here. Understand? More address return. You can create a lot of houses. Create four here. Create four return addresses. Then connect different products. At this time, The corresponding product return. He will automatically return to the corresponding upper. Okay. Can you understand what I'm talking about at this time? Can you keep up? K1. Don't understand? K2. Can you keep up? Can you keep up? Right? Yes.

That platform is called control C control V. Solved the problem. But it has to keep all the pictures. But all the uploads. All the fillings. It's a lot of trouble, right? So it's a little slow to upload manually. Copy. It's too slow. You know, manually on the shelf. You think you're on the shelf. See one? Five minutes and a half. Five minutes and a half. If I go on the shelf, that ten products. It's probably an hour. And it's still simple. It's not about color classification. I'll show you. If you have color classification. When you go on the shelf. It's a little more trouble. Let me give you an example. Well, for example. For example. What do you do on the shelf? For example, this one. Suppose you want to manually go on the shelf. It's a lot of trouble to go on the shelf. Handle the shelf. You have to upload a lot of information. You know? You don't control C control V. You see. You have to fill in the group shape. Embroidery shape. waist shape. Then down. Style. And then you have to write the color. Size. And then you have to write. You see different colors. There's sml. Right? And then you have to write the main picture of the product. And then you have to write this. Description of the picture. Right? And then so you're this equivalent to you on a piece. You have to upload so much stuff. It's a problem. You see, this is our one-click upload. We're going to be a little bit easier. Control C control V. And then check it again. That's it. Okay. This is the whole one-click exposure and manual exposure. A mode of exposure. And then if the price fails. What do you do if the price fails? You go to the product violation. And then look at the review. Not passed. And then go to the reason for the violation. You can modify it based on the reason. You see. For example, here. You see. This is a background of the little red book app. He will point out. Product violation. Right? I'll click in. Click in. Then he'll tell me. Violated. What's the product not passed? Right? Unsellable. I'll click in. After a while, he'll tell me. You see. You're this. You're this. The product on the shelf. No. Violated. I'll check the reason for the violation. And then what's the reason for the violation? He said hello. You're in this design. The telegram of the treasure. And then you have to submit it again. And then I click in and look at this picture. Let's zoom in. This picture. What's written on this picture? What to add to my personal WeChat. This one. Just to keep the information. Right? So that's what I said earlier. You have to check it. If he's in that picture. You have a message. You plug it in. Right? Don't put it in your product. Don't put it in your store. Okay. This is our whole process of getting on the shelf. It's divided into two. One is manual. One is a one-off. Okay. At this time, everyone. I'm done with my content. I've been talking for half an hour. And then you can ask questions. About the post-sale version. I'll talk about it tomorrow. About the post-sale version. For example, how to go to Wu Hen to ship. How do you know? This is related to the commercial connection. This is what we'll do tomorrow. Tomorrow or the next time. I'll talk to you again next time. How do you go to the commercial communication when this is related to you? What are we talking about today? How to put a screen on it. How to turn on your electricity. Okay, what questions do you have? You can ask. How's it going today? Did you make a lot of money? Let's take a look at your questions. Recommend a few categories. One is the clothing category of this lady. The bag shoes category. And then there's the food category. And then there's the temporary category. But temporary, it needs food. Food certification. It feels like the market is big halfway in. What about the recommended category? There's another home-based category. It's the daily one. For example, this kind of. Toothpaste, right? Toothpaste cup. And what toys? And the bracelet. This kind of can be. All right. The accurate flow is through content. It's through content. It's a form of typing labels and writing keywords. To do content. This content form is what we're going to talk about next. How do I send notes? How to choose a product? How to send beautiful notes after choosing a product? Break this bottle down. And then let more people order through this note. You don't have to buy a product to see the quality. We just said you don't need to. You first put a lot of it. Which one is out of stock? You buy it. I told you. You put 50. Maybe there's only one. You chose 50. A group of people. Maybe there's only one. A group of people sold it. Then you put this. A group of people. You buy it back. Look at the quality. You understand? It's not that I sold it. I sold 100. A group of people. I bought 100. A group of people. All right. The phone case is fine. The phone case is fine. Yes. If your ID has been registered, You have to use your mother's or brother's sister's. One ID. One ID for each individual store. Only one store can open. One individual store for each individual store. You can open three. Can you drink water and drink? All food items. He needs that. Food items. There are also makeup items. He needs you to upload your ID and certificate. If you have one, you can. If you don't, you have to go to the Taobao. Do one. The other one is still old. I'll build a new one. Build a new one. The phone registration signal is tied to the ID and the phone card. Is it the same? It doesn't seem to be consistent. That's what you have to do with your ID. It's not consistent with your phone number. Food items should all be needed. As long as it's food items, it needs to be self-made. Which item sells well? Those I just said are all fine. Bookkeeping items seem to be bad. Bookkeeping items need to be self-made. If you can't operate, listen to the class carefully first. Because I've already demonstrated it in great detail. You can follow my class to operate. There's no problem. You see, I just listened to this class three times. Today's first time is called the broken cognitive. The second time is called the practice. The third time is the first class. You know? Because we've already talked about it. It's very, very detailed. After the market, do you have to send your notes to each product? Of course. If you don't send your notes, how will people see you? How will people buy from your store? The logic of the novel is to use content to drive the product. That is, I want to sell a cup. I must first send a note to praise how good this cup is. Right? Then someone may order. If you don't send notes, how can others buy from your store? Crystal jade can also be. It can also be. Taobao quality. Yes, yes, yes. You can do it on Taobao. There is no way to use commercial pictures. There is no general right. Because all the Internet is now using those pictures. You search. You search for everything. All the things. I said you don't look for that kind of one. It's that kind of Chanel. That kind of big brand. There is also a brand with a clear label. For example, Li Ning. For example, Hui Li. For example, what? What brand can you call out? You know? Brands don't use others. Except for that kind of three. It's that kind of earring. It's not a name. You can use it. And I'll tell you how to avoid insects. I'll talk about it next time. Isn't it a picture? Then I can edit it twice. I'll do it twice. Right? For example, it's a picture type, right? I can put his picture in. Then pass a BGM. Then add some green. Right? Then add some animation. I turn his picture into an animation video. Can you do it? Right? It's called the second creation. It's a micro-edit.

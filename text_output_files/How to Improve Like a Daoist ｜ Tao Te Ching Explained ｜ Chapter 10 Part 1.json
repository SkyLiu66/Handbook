While you cleanse your inner vision, will you be found without fault? Can you love people and lead them without forcing your will on them? When heaven gives and takes away, can you be content with the outcome? When you understand all things, can you step back from your own understanding? Giving birth and nourishing. Making without possessing. Expecting nothing in return. To grow, yet not to control. This is the mysterious virtue. So I think one common misunderstanding about Taoism is the conflation of humility and softness with weakness and apathy. Taoism teaches us to be soft, but it does not teach us to be weak. On the contrary, the Tao Te Ching instructs us to improve ourselves as much as we possibly can. It's just that self-improvement for a Taoist often looks quite different from the self-improvement we see all around us in the rest of the world. And let's just establish one thing here. Taoism and self-improvement do indeed go hand in hand. The first lines of chapter 10 read, Nurturing your soul, letting it become whole. This is a kind of self-mastery. But it isn't the self-mastery that comes from aggressively trying to eradicate all of your faults. It isn't making a list of all your problems. And making goals to fix them. Lists and goals can be helpful. And they can have their place. But the Tao Te Ching prescribes a different kind of healing. Think of what it means to nurture your soul. Another translation renders this passage as, Husbanding the animal and spiritual souls. Another reads, Can you coax your mind from its wandering and keep to the original oneness? Now obviously each of these translations differ quite a bit. When I read the Tao Te Ching, I like to read several translations side by side. To try to pick out the main theme that's shared by all of them. Kind of like using multiple lenses in an optical instrument to bring a picture into greater clarity. If you put each of these translations alongside each other, you can see that this nurturing of the soul is not a forced agenda or an itemized to-do list. But rather a gentle guiding of the mind and spirit into harmony one with another. Do you remember what it was like when you first started learning to meditate? Or if you're still learning, as we certainly all are, can you think of the first few times you were able to meditate? Or the first few times you ever tried it? Many people experience their first few attempts at meditation as frustrating and difficult. When I hear people talk about quote-unquote failed attempts at meditation, I most often hear them saying things like, I just can't get my mind to slow down. This betrays a common and totally natural misunderstanding about meditation, which is the idea that meditation is about forcing your mind to calm down and stop thinking. Well, of course, this just doesn't work. One of the most certain methods of getting yourself to think about something, is telling yourself not to think about it. So, in meditation, we don't try to do this. We allow the mind to do whatever it wants to do. We just choose not to engage with it as it does so. We simply watch the thoughts come and go without dwelling on them. Like we are sitting on the side of the road, watching cars drive by. Now, to bring it all back, this definitely takes repetition and practice, but it isn't the sort of thing that you can force to happen. People that teach meditation will often say to gently guide your mind back each time you feel it being carried away by a particular thought. Learning to meditate involves a lot of this gentle guiding back of the mind. Each time you do this, it strengthens your ability to remain a passive observer of your thoughts. This is practice. You are practicing meditation. Learning to master your brain's impulses to get caught up in thought is a kind of self-mastery. But self-mastery in this sense, as you can see, is not the same as forcing. Chapter 33 of the Tao Te Ching tells us, Those who master others are strong. Those who master themselves have true power. So while Taoism absolutely is concerned with self-mastery, it teaches a new way of going about it. You are not learning by force of will to behave differently. You are learning to think differently. To see the world differently. A change in behavior is merely a natural result of a change in our personal nature. Now, I can see I've taken up the entire length of this video on only the first two lines of the passage, so I think I might need to make this chapter into a two-part video. So keep an eye out for the second one. But for now, thanks for watching, and I'll see you tomorrow. For chapter 10, part 2. Peace and blessings.",

Those who are stiff and rigid are the disciple of death. Those who are soft and yielding are the disciples of life. The rigid and stiff will be broken. The soft and yielding will overcome. Okay, so as you guys know, we are nearing the end of the Dao De Jing Explained series. Following this series, my plan is to transition to fewer, higher quality uploads, where I can go more in depth on topics that I think are especially important. I already have quite a few topics in mind that I'd like to cover in these deeper videos, and this topic is one of them. Because of this, I'm not going to go super deep into this subject now, because I'd like to cover it more in a longer and better produced video. So, let's get started. So, just know that one thing you can most likely look forward to at the end of the Dao De Jing series is an in-depth, practical guide on how to use Wu Wei in your life. If you guys do have any requests about videos you'd like to see done, you can put them in the comments if you want, and I'll at least consider it. So with that said, let's talk a little bit about flexibility. When people really make up their minds to accomplish something, they often go about it in a very specific way. This way usually involves a strong, steadfast determination to hold everything you want to do. So, let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started.",

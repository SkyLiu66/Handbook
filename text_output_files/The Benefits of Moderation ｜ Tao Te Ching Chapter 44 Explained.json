He who is most endeared to something must pay dearest for it. He who has hoarded much will suffer great loss. He who knows when enough is enough saves himself from humiliation. He who knows when to stop protects himself from peril. To know this is to be long enduring. It is essential that we should do this. These desires come from our most basic human instincts for survival. However, when you think about it, isn't your life a greater blessing than any amount of fame or money could ever be? Is there really a point in using up every spare minute of this life to acquire wealth, possessions, and recognition that will only cost more and more precious time to maintain? Acquiring something can be a gift that comes along with a curse if we are not prepared for it. Sometimes, getting the thing we desire, actually ends up eating our happiness away as we lose ourselves to fear of losing that thing. Taoism teaches us to learn to let go of the things we desire, even the things we already have in love. It's not that we get rid of them, but we hold on to them loosely, understanding and accepting that they could be taken away from us at any time. Knowing when to stop is incredibly important. Moderation protects us and keeps us safe from the dangers that come with excess. The person who knows when to stop, eating, is able to avoid the health risks associated with overeating. A person who knows when to stop working will not miss out on their loved ones and other life experiences outside of work. A person who knows when to stop acquiring possessions will not be a slave to maintaining them. Not only does moderation help protect us from such dangers, it is a key component in creating a life that can be experienced with satisfaction. A life dominated by excess can never be enjoyed for long. Excess can be exciting in the short term, but always leads to a deadening of the senses and a numbing of pleasure in the long term. Learning to be content is almost more of a process of unlearning a lifetime of habits and thought patterns than it is learning a new skill. We have to learn to see things differently and to stop putting emphasis on the things held dear by the people around us. Definitely a large task to take on, but the Tao will teach us how to do this if we direct our awareness to it. As we get better and better at this, we will be able to reap the benefits that come from living a satisfied life. Thanks for watching, and I will see you all tomorrow for chapter 45. Peace and blessings.",

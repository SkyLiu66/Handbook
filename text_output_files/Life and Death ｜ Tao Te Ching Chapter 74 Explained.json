If men live in constant fear of dying, and if breaking the law means that a man will be killed, who will dare to break the law? There is always an official executioner. If you try to take his place, it is like trying to be a master carpenter and cutting wood. If you try to cut wood like a master carpenter, you will only hurt your hand. This chapter is a bit interesting because it isn't super clear how it is meant to be interpreted. Some say that this chapter is Lao Tzu advocating for the death penalty. Others say that it is Lao Tzu discouraging it. For those who see this chapter as supporting the death penalty, the first part of this chapter is taken as saying that if people are in constant fear of death from breaking the law, then nobody will dare to break it. They then look at the second part of the chapter, the part about the executioner, and see in it the meaning that there is always an official executioner appointed by the government, and that this person is a master in his craft, and that those who are not experienced in it should not attempt it. So there is one interpretation. On the other hand, it is possible to interpret this chapter in a largely opposite sense, as a criticism of the death penalty. Those who see this meaning in the chapter look to the first few lines. If men are not afraid to die, they will not be afraid to die. If men are not afraid to die, they will not be afraid to die. It is no avail to threaten them with death. The second interpretation of the chapter holds that the death penalty is not always effective as a means of intimidation, because some people are not afraid to die. Going on to the second part of the chapter, this point of view holds that the official executioner Lao Tzu refers to is nature. Nature is the one true executioner, and trying to be the judge of when people live or die runs contrary to nature and should not be attempted. I'm not going to give an opinion either way on this. I just think it's worth pointing out both sides of the argument so that you can make up your own mind about what's being said. You can leave your opinion in the comments if you like, or come discuss it in the discord. And with that, thanks for watching, and I will see you all tomorrow for chapter 75. Peace and blessings.",

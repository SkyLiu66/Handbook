While you cleanse your inner vision, will you be found without fault? Can you love people and lead them without forcing your will on them? When heaven gives and takes away, can you be content with the outcome? When you understand all things, can you take a step back from your own understanding? Giving birth and nourishing, making without possessing, expecting nothing in return. To grow, yet not to control. This is the mysterious virtue. Chapter 10 gives several different examples of behavior or events that will result from this state of natural softness. We broke down the first one in the last video. The next example we encounter is in the next line. Focus your life breath until you become supple as a newborn child. This life breath comes from the word qi. Qi is an ancient Chinese concept that refers to a sort of life energy that flows throughout the universe and throughout all people. The ability to focus your qi in this way is indicative of great ability and focus. It's telling us to develop the ability to be able to master and hone ourselves while staying as flexible and non-forcing as a small baby. Many other religions and philosophies advise us to emulate the innocence of children. Jesus also said to become as little children. Children are humble, patient, and quick to forgive. Likewise in leadership, we are told to love people and lead them without forcing our will on them. Love comes before lead. When we truly love someone, we take them as a part of ourselves. We conflate their best interests with our best interests. True love for someone is not a matter of how much you love them. True love for someone is not a matter of how much you love them. True love for someone is not a matter of how much you love them. True love for someone is giving them what they need the most when they deserve the least at great personal cost if necessary. A master understands that leadership is not an opportunity for self-aggrandizement. His primary focus is on loving the people whom he leads. When circumstances do not go his way, he doesn't fret about them. He doesn't waste time or energy wishing they were something they are not. He allows things to be given to him and taken from him, knowing that this is the way of the universe, and allowing things to be as they are. As his understanding of all things grows, so does his openness, to seeing things as they really are. This is in contrast to the archetypical scholar or pedant, which, as he learns more, increasingly begins to shove things into the little boxes that he has created for interpreting them. The scholar puts great emphasis on categorizing and naming things. The master recognizes that the obsessive naming and categorizing of things often does more harm than good, as it can lead us to make assumptions of things or see them as cast in concrete, rather than being subject to new or continued observation. He is present to observe the stories that all things, tell about themselves, rather than trying to write the stories for them. He is like the sun, which sustains, nourishes, and brings life to things, without laying any arbitrary claims of ownership to them, and without having any expectations of being paid back. This is the virtue of inner softness, the quiet, present, open, pliable state in which the master resides, where he can freely observe and hear his or her intuition. We experience something like this when we meditate, or when we spend time alone in nature. Learning to reside in this state is, one of the most important things we can do to lead happier lives, and to allow ourselves to become more in harmony with the Tao. If you guys have any questions about this, feel free to leave them in the comments or come into the discord and ask. And until then, I'll see you guys tomorrow for chapter 11.",

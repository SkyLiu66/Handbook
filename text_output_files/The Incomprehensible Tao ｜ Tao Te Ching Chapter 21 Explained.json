Just remember what Lao Tzu said. The universe began as a void. The void fills with images. Images lead to the creation of objects. And every object has Dao at its core. That's the way it's been ever since the world began. How can I be so sure? I just know. Alright, well, thanks for humoring me there. For this chapter, I decided to pull out one of my personal favorite translations, the Rob Hogan translation. I love this translation not because it's especially accurate or precise, but mostly because I find its no-nonsense, cowboyish tone entertaining. With this chapter, however, I felt comfortable with whipping out this translation, because I feel that it actually gets the overall idea of the chapter pretty well. This chapter is another one of these sort of Dao poems we see scattered throughout the text. As with all of them, though, there are concrete things we can learn hidden amongst all the prose. Here, we are dealing with creation theory and the underlying structure of the universe. Well, of course, as soon as we start dealing with topics like these, we are treading out of the realm of scientific verifiability, just as we would have been doing in Lao Tzu's day. In the time of Lao Tzu, there was much about the natural world in which people lived which was not understood. Weather, seasons, animal behavior, evolution, and so on. But we're not done yet. Evolution, the night sky, these concepts must have seemed as obscure and unfathomable as the bottom of the ocean. Today, thanks to science, we have some degree of understanding about how some of these things work. However, an understanding of the very base of it, the nature of the universe itself, what holds it all together, what causes it to all go on at the most basic levels, still eludes us. We can't explain it with science. Really, we can't explain it at all. Because the thing that lies at the heart of all of it predates any words or concepts that we might try to use to describe it. This thing is the underlying structure of the universe. The underlying heartbeat of the universe. The way. Some choose to disregard that which is unseen, but others know better. How? They just know. Other translations render the last line as, I look inside myself and see. Those who choose not to disregard intuition gain another sense that allows them to detect more than what is discernible with the other five senses. They can feel the presence of underlying truths that cannot be proved using scientific observation. Learning to hear and follow this intuition is at the heart of wu-wei, the heart of following the Tao. Thanks for watching and we'll see you next time. I'll see you all tomorrow for chapter 22. Peace and blessings.",

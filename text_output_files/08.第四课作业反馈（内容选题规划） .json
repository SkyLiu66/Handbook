Otherwise, it's too far away. For example, you may have done a lot of content, but you can't create a transformation. So the trans content that it does, it has to plan out every stage. For example, the first stage is to do the親子活动 . The second stage is this short-term travel. You can understand that this親子活动 is a product of a trend. Then short-term travel, and then the next stage. It actually has a T-dose configuration. So I think this is a very good piece. It's probably clear. When you look at the topic, it also feels interesting. And then for this project, I think there is a point. I saw this place. After seeing this place, it's actually a bit like this kind of carbon-dioxide supply. This is the human nature and this positioning. Because you love to eat and play, right? Then go around and see some delicious and fun places. And then I think in this, you actually have to do this for the subsequent services. You are the front end. You can add some visits to some of the親子 places. For example, what kind of親子 cafe, what kind of親子 entertainment, and then go to visit these places. And then in fact, it can also be transferred to the back. It's still directly related to the relatives. And then the user's transfer will be smoother. Okay, okay, I understand. I understand. Thank you, teacher. Okay, that's it for this assignment. And then let's take a look at this assignment. In detail. Let's open the microphone in detail and make it simple for everyone to say. The first two of them, I think I have something to learn. That is, their planning goals are still relatively strong. Their planning goals are still relatively strong. Their planning goals are still relatively strong. Their planning goals are still relatively strong. But what about my homework? I think. The main thing is that according to the industry I do, then I think all the content is all around my purpose. What is the customer group I want to attract? And then my first type of words is because I have been doing it. It's the student's real essay display. Because I have a student's resource. And I myself. I have been paying attention to it. That is, when I was doing that target account, I also saw it. There are a lot of essays on the Internet, but. There is no student's most real. There is no real essay. So what about this section? I will continue to insist on doing it. Because my little red book is the only thing I've posted so far. And then I posted these. I'm not too. Not too. Just too hard to do it. Now there are almost 500 or more. More than 500 fans. Then I will divide it. According to this situation, I will divide it into a result display. That is mainly the student's essay display. Right? If the user sees so many children's essays, it is actually a side display. Then you as a teacher. How to prove that you are an excellent teacher? That must be how excellent your trained students are. Right? That's how I consider being my product display. Then the devil builds books. It is also recorded by students. Video student's thinking. He recommended a good book himself. Then we also provide a display platform for students. At the same time, I want to be a parent. Now we have a lot of this on the Internet. For example, a mother-in-law or a book reader to build a book. But if it is a book for children. I think it can be from the perspective of children. Go out. What books are they reading? What deep thinking and insights do they have after they read it? Then this is what I can do continuously. The excellent reading of students. The presentation of the book is a feedback after the children read the book. Then these points are my one. The presentation of product content. And this is 75 pages. I can keep doing it. The second post-editing content is mainly for users. I can provide some. Is. Data. Is the resource. For example, the work of this thinker. Now, we will provide this elementary school stage. From the second grade to the sixth grade. In every semester in the school. The child has to write eight works. In fact, the work of words. Now, in fact, it is also a difficulty for school education. For children. Many children. Is to write a work. It is also difficult to find the direction. Then I will provide a writing method here. Instruction. That is, a guide for a thinker. It is equivalent to the reference of parents. Of course. Equipped with this thinker as a treasure. I will also have a special online class. But in the online class. I may pay later. Just as an experience. A course on the online. Then the following one. Reading. Learning. The method. It is also a. In fact, it is also provided to the user. Know that we have some. What methods do we have? Then the back. Education point of view. And the dog. The dog. Mainly. For me. Some of the personal. Is the education concept and point of view. Showing the personality. For example, I. As a teacher. Or as our. Our institution. What is my concept and point of view? That is through. These things. To express. Probably like this. The last section. For the software. Is. Is some of my own. Show. Because. I also talked about this account before. Is. I don't want to make it a product number. There are still some people. Then. Then this section. I will share some. My personal. This is the knowledge of reading. Travel. Is my personal hobby. Craft. All aspects. I will have some. Share. Probably. That's it. I think. It's okay. There is no. What to do. A particularly good place. Maybe the industry is different. OK. OK. Then I will comment on this homework. This homework. Its content. Very rich. Basically. Just put your own short-term. I think some of the options that can be done. All written out. And then. This homework. The red part in front. Is my target. Just need to do a. Relatively detailed. Some of the categories. So you will find. Your paper content. The ratio. Is the highest. And then this. Product content. And the human nature content. The ratio is very low. And then in this. The missing things. Is that you can optimize. Is you. Your order. Is. We are still back to that. Go through stages. You are at this stage. Is to do. What kind of. Target. For example. You are doing. Human nature. Then you should. Share more. Some human nature content. And then. Is your product type content. Mainly for the purpose of. The supply and demand service. So everyone must remember. The product type content we do. Is. For the supply and demand service. Because if you do. Product type content. And can't go. Let the user understand your product. Choose to connect you. Then this product type content. Is actually hard. That kind of hard. In fact, he. Can't bring you. Deal. And then. Can't. Let you get a. Better data. That kind of content. Is. To do. Optimize. And then. In this. I need to mention. A point. Everyone is the same. Is the early stage. Try not to. Is. This. The content. Is. Is. Not too much. Is. All. Is. The content. Is. Generally. Not very. It's. Especially. The signal. If. Then. I'll tell you. The reason. Why. If. Say. The previous. Basically. Is. The content. It's not good. Not good. The point. Is. That. You. Generally. This. Special. The content. It's actually. Relatively. Is. Will. More. Small. Heavy. Of. Ah. Is. More. More. Professional. More. Professional. This. Ah. Is. Not. That. This. Is. A. Very. Small. Ah. Is. Relatively. Not. So. Wide. Ah. Then. You. This. Is. The content. Is. Relatively. The data. Relatively. Will. Will. Is. Not. Specially. Good. In. Conditions. Is. Is. Not. Very. Able. To. Make. Your. Account. Quickly. Start. A. A. A. A. A. So. Of. Of. Certain. Early. is that the content should be fluid and vertical. The content should be fluid. The content should be fluid. What is fluid content? In the question, we didn't plan this part out. For example, how to make children love reading. The content should be very broad. The range of the questions should be broad. The content should be very broad. It should be similar to reading habits, thinking, writing, etc. This is fluid content. So, you must make sure that the content is well-matched with the content and the character. The content should be fluid and the character. Generally speaking, you need to match the content with the character. If you have the character content, and you are going to promote products later, people will have a stronger sense of trust in you. The conversion rate will be higher. In this context, I didn't understand what fluid content is. I don't recommend you to make fluid content in your account in the early stage. Why? Because in the early stage, your account must be based on you, not on any third party. If you make fluid content in a normal way, you should put it directly on the company's brand account, not on your personal brand account. This is my suggestion. Yes. Because this will blur the image and label of your account. For example, if you have other files, it will be different every time. Yes. So, I think it's better to make fluid content in the early stage. And then, since it's product-based content, the core content is fluid content. So, you can buy some hooks in the product-based content. It's not just about showing the dry goods, for example, how it's displayed, etc. Product-based content like this should be able to highlight some of its characteristics. For example, how do you guide students? What is the student's situation like? It can let the user know that what is the solution you are providing? Then, this kind of content will be better. It will be more fluid. It's not just about showing my product, but I can also enrich my product from various angles to give users an understanding and to highlight my selling point. Okay, that's it for this part of the homework. Next, the next part of the homework. The next part of the homework is for Fei. This part is actually not bad. She's pretty clear about the specific topics. The content of dry goods and pitfalls is mostly fluid content. And then, the personality. There are also some topics about rice. And then, in this part, I think it's good to optimize it. For example, the content of dry goods and pitfalls. You can also divide it into more details. For example, what Mu Yan and others talked about is similar. You have to divide the different sections of the home decor. For example, you have a dictionary and a full dictionary, right? Actually, a dictionary can also be used to talk about a lot of things. And then, the full dictionary can also be used to talk about a lot of things. And then, the furniture and electricity in the house, and so on. You can make it into a comparison. And then, if you organize this part, I think it will be better. And then, let's take a look at this part of the homework. This part of the homework is a bit scattered. It's a bit scattered. It's a bit scattered. And it's only written five episodes. This homework, the good thing to think about is, for example, like what you did, whether you can use the location, the price, the law of limitations, right? Just use these as conditions to make some details. The target audience is different. For example, the one who has a price of $1,000 and $2,000 is not the same kind of person. So, you still have to go back to what you did and what problems you can solve for the user. For example, this kind of photo must count, and the roughness of the special定. This is a bit too big. This is a bit too big. And the must count is seasonal. This is a seasonal thing. So, you still haven't really figured out the problems of the users. This is the core problem of this homework. Okay, we're almost done. This is the end of the homework review. Next, I'll invite the guests to come over to Baya.",

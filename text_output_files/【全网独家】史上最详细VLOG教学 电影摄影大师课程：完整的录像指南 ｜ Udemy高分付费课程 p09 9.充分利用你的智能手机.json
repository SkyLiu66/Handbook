Now I'm going to set up a screen cap on this really quick. And of course, what we just saw and learned was a lot of complex shooting and a lot of different scenarios. But I really want to boil this down to the simplest form and really give you some good takeaways here. So what I'm going to do is open up my camera app on the phone. Now later in the course, we're going to be learning about different types of camera apps that you can use. They're going to give you all different types of resolutions that we're going to get to. But here I want to really focus on applying some of the things that we just went through. Now from the footage that we just saw, filmmaking and video creating is a lot about making what's in front of the camera look better than it looks in real life. We're using cinematography techniques to really upgrade the experience. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and set up a screen cap on this and I'm going to go ahead and show you guys what I'm going to be shooting. So let's go ahead and get started. So let's go ahead and get started. So let's go ahead and get started. So let's go ahead and get started. So let's go ahead and get started. So let's go ahead and get started. Now, you saw the example of the difference between something that is a tripod shot. So let me set this up. So you can see, as we're looking at our object of interest here, there's not a whole lot going on. And it's really called motion picture for a reason. So this is perfect for shooting an interview. This is perfect for shooting more long form content. Right now, more of the content that we're going to be shooting is going to be on a tripod. Now, my 1DX Mk2 is sitting on a tripod because that's the ideal shooting style for this scenario. Now, there's not much of recording this on a tripod, it's not a very long form piece of content that I want to shoot. If I want to create something that's more short form and more interesting and has more energy, what I'm going to want to do is move the slightly and we're gonna go really deep into this later in the course but for now I really want to get the wheels turning and the gears turning for you and while you're going through this course you're gonna be able to plug in these understandings into the new skill set that you're gonna gain so like I mentioned if I'm wanting to shoot an angle of this camera you can do very simple movement really slow and easy movement what I call doing the yoga pose okay it doesn't have to be an elaborate you know it doesn't have to be something very elaborate but you can see that you want to brace your body and move with your whole body when you are moving your camera doesn't matter what you're shooting on if I do this with just my hands okay you can see that there's not as much stabilization from the person who's holding the camera so if you move with your whole body and really lock in the axis of the camera so you got to imagine that there's up front down left and right these are the axi axis that the camera can move in the more you lock that down which is what a 3-axis gimbal does but it's not a 3-axis gimbal it's a 3-axis gimbal and it's not a 3-axis gimbal but when you're shooting is something that's a little bit more less produced you still want it to look good whether it's going on Instagram or YouTube or whatever it is a video that you're sending to your family you want to be proud of it you want it to feel good you want it to look good so shooting something adding a little bit of movement I'll demonstrate this also before we move from the phone to something else I'm gonna demonstrate this quickly with a boomerang on Instagram and if I hit a record and do a slight push in you can see it adds a cool dynamic look compared just to a tripod shot now if I do what we just learned about more of that yoga pose style you can see there's more of a dynamic feel so this is something that you're picking up on you're like I like that video I like that imagery but I'm explaining to you why that looks good or feels good as a video so we did the first shot a little bit dynamic push in and we did the second one it was slightly more dynamic with the background shifting behind our object now if we do something more complex with more energy now that's adding a whole new spice and a whole new characteristic to what we're shooting nothing else changed the last two videos we shot with the 4K X-Snap Core theается you a lot of little devoted weight that you put on the each object and we made the full video a process and first thing it was like I had it all done put it all into focus at this same place and then you've kind of like if you're Mic drive it's this much much faster and you're cutting down the size just for the scenario, same person holding the camera, but choosing to add the right type of movement in a way that's balanced and stabilized is going to give that really smooth, higher produced, silky, you know, aesthetically pleasing image. So the last thing that I want to mention with that is deciding when to use the different lenses that come with your phone. Now, if I'm shooting this, there's a lot, it's a very busy looking framing, right? Or very busy composition. There's stuff here, there's stuff there on the right. Okay, you can kind of see the background. Now I can move closer and focus and the background starts to fall off. And all we see is what we're interested in. And that's what we're interested in. And that's what we're interested in. And that's what we're interested in shooting. Now, if I use the more telephoto lens, now that's going to make that effect even more dramatic, where what's in focus is very in focus. And what's behind what we're shooting is very blurry and out of focus. What that's also going to do with the more telephoto lens is make the background change a lot more dramatic. So you can see the difference. Right? Huge difference between this type of shot, that's a more wide angle lens, there's a lot going on. And then this shot where we really push in, or we really zoom in to what we're shooting. And we're making that extremely important, right? It's creating a much more cinematic image because the eye is going straight into the frame, what's in focus, what's important is being enhanced by using a more telephoto lens. So with a little bit of a more telephoto lens, we're going to be able to get a lot more dramatic shots. So if you're going to be using a lot of yoga pose, and using the right lens choice for your shooting situation, you're going to start getting a lot",

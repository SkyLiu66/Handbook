If we slowly are moving, panning, tilting, doing a crane shot, doing an arc shot through a scene, it's slowly unfolding that feeling for our viewer. If we speed those movements up while we're shooting, it creates a lot more action and a lot more energy that quickly changes and makes the viewer feel a certain way. And so with that said, this can go really, really deep, but this is the overall, really the overview that I really wanted you to understand in this course of the basis, right? The foundation of how to use and understand these different key camera movement types so that you can further tell your story. In the next lecture, I'm going to actually show you guys how I use these methods of camera movement and framing. And these are the things that we're going to talk about. We've talked about in relation to shooting a shot with just one angle to shooting the same exact shot and scene with multiple angles, with different types of camera movement and really telling the story that way. And then in the following lecture will be a learning exercise where you guys will be able to film your own scene in two different ways, the normal standard way and the upgraded way with everything that we discussed. So I will see you in the next lecture.",

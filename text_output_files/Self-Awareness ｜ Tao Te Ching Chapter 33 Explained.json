Those who know they have enough are truly wealthy. Those who persist will reach their goal. Those who keep their course have a strong will. Those who embrace death will not perish, but have life everlasting. Self-awareness is an extremely important concept in Taoism. Understanding the workings of society, people, and science is certainly valuable. However, if we chase these kinds of intellectual pursuits without taking time to understand the person behind our own eyelids, we will run into problems. The hard part is, it's actually very difficult to become objectively aware of the self, because there is no person on earth who we have a greater incentive to misunderstand. Understanding of the self is a very important concept in Taoism. Understanding the self takes time and life experience, and there are some dangers we run into with regards to self-knowledge. One danger we run into is that sometimes we think we're practicing self-knowledge when we are actually just making our minds up not to change. As an IT customer service representative, I had many opportunities to help people fix problems with their technology, and I remember one of the most common things I would hear from customers would be something along the lines of, I'm just not very good at technology. I would certainly not expect my customers to strive for an in-depth understanding of technology. Most of them had their own careers that they had worked in for years, and we can't expect to become experts in everything we do. However, from time to time, there were a few customers that more or less refused to learn to use the technology we provided them with. It seemed to me that some of these people would outright choose not to adopt the systems and technology we provided them with, regarding their technological ineptitude as an insurmountable barrier. We don't have to become experts in everything we do, but the human brain can't do that. We can't just be a bunch of people who can't learn a remarkable amount of things if we give it a fair chance. Sometimes, we refuse opportunities to learn and grow, and hide behind our supposed self-knowledge as an excuse. I just can't do that. I'm no good at that sort of thing. That just isn't my style. We pull out many of these well-worn aphorisms to excuse ourselves from having to grow and change. But the problem is, most of us really don't have enough self-knowledge to really know what we're good at and what we're not. Another danger surrounding our quest for self-awareness is that so few people are able to learn and grow. We can't learn a remarkable amount of things if we don't have enough self-knowledge to really know what we're good at and what we're not. We can't learn a remarkable amount of things if we don't have enough self-awareness to really know what we're good at and what we're not. One of the most pervasive characteristics about human beings is being in denial. Most people walk around in massive amounts of denial about something, but usually about many things. We are highly incentivized not to really understand ourselves for many reasons, but one thing that makes it so hard is the baggage we pick up over our lives. True self-awareness is difficult, partly because we view ourselves through the lens of what we have learned over the course of our lives as good or bad. We make judgments about ourselves, and we don't know what we're good at or bad at. We don't realize they exist or know what we do for a living, and we accept them as truth. For example, we make lots of false negative assumptions such as, I'm just not very good at math, or I'm just an angry person. The Bible reckons to be true, doubtful, and endpoint the whole language, by not really being aware of the underlying truth behind them. Transition to Judy's memoir Bradben dismissed practice by trying to eliminate something that caused him to speak. Often these judgments were based on beliefs that we somehow picked up early in our lives, many of which are just untrue, but which are rarely challenged because, for example, if we believe we are bad at math, we just avoid math and the statement becomes self-fulfilling. We also walk around with lots of false positive assumptions as well, often because of our need to feel like we are a good person and because of the lessons we learned early in life about what a good person is. For example, say there is a girl that is raised in a family where girls are expected to be sweet and polite and quiet. Anytime she got angry, she was shamed for it and was taught that it was wrong. She may go about for the rest of her life identifying with the fact that she is sweet and cute and polite. She may present this outward image to everyone and do such a good job that she even believes it herself. She, like almost everyone on earth, has a need to believe that she is a good person, and the story she has learned is that a good person means sweet and cute and polite. But inside, maybe she is not this at all. Maybe unbeknownst even to her, she is actually extremely angry and resentful because of the self-expression she was never allowed to have. This anger will continue to build over the course of her life until she can no longer ignore it, until it manifests itself as physical problems and her body literally starts to break down. It's so hard to understand ourselves, because we don't really understand the world or our place in it. The best way to come to really know ourselves is to draw closer to the Tao, which contains understanding of all selves and all things. The more in harmony with Tao, the more we will be able to understand ourselves, and the more we will be able to understand ourselves. The more in harmony with Tao, the more we will be able to understand ourselves, and the more we will be able to understand ourselves. Thanks for watching, and I will see you all tomorrow for chapter 34. Peace and blessings.",

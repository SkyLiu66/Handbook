    "data": " I remember reading an essay by Harlan Ellison in which he pointed to an essay by Robert Heinlein and they suggested rules for writers and the rules were how to get published and I read them and I believed them and I have applied them and they have worked for me. Rule one, you have to write. If you don't write, nothing will happen. Rule two, you have to finish what you write. If you start it and abandon it or if you start it and never let it go. You know, I know people who just really want to make something perfect so they never finish, they never let it go. You have to finish. Rule three, having finished it, you have to send it out into the world to somebody who could publish it. These days of internet, that actually broadens your scope. There are so many websites that actually want fiction, want things, but there are also publishers out there, there are agents, you send it out. And that bit, is important. I was talking earlier with Caroline about bravery. There are a lot of things that people know are brave. You know, standing up to an armed robber, definitely brave. Wild dog attack, dealing with it, absolute act of bravery. People don't normally list sending a story out into the world. As one of those acts of bravery up there with standing up to armed robbers or wild dog attacks, but really, they really are. Next rule, Heinlein's was refrain from rewriting except to editorial request. Having sent it out, don't just start it again. Don't keep writing that book, that story over and over again. Harlan Ellison added, a little note on that. He said, unless you feel what the editor has requested would compromise the integrity of your story, in which case, don't touch it, defend it. Also, perfectly valid. The next rule is, when it comes back, because it will probably come back, you have to send it out again. You can't go, I sent it out to this editor, to this publisher, to this agent. It has come back. My heart is broken. I will never write it again. I will put it away. Instead, you have to send it out somewhere out there. There is somebody so drunk, so desperate, so confused that they will buy it and they will publish it. And so you're trying to reach that person or perhaps somebody with good enough taste and somebody smart enough. Whoever it is, keep going, keep sending it out until you reach that person. And the other rule, which is mine, wasn't Heinlein's and it wasn't Harlan's, is, and then start the next thing. Through this all, start the next thing. When you finish that first thing and you start the process of sending it out, begin writing the next thing. Because that's the important thing, is, apart from anything else, when that publisher comes to you and says, we love this novel, but we'd love, what's the sequel like? You can say, yes, here is the sequel. I finished that too. And get them even more excited. You need to be writing the next thing. You don't just write something and send it out and then wait for fame and fortune to come knocking on your door. You keep going, you keep writing, you keep finishing things, and now you have more things to send out into the world. Those were Heinlein's rules. They were Harlan Allison's rules. And I'm afraid they're mine too. They work for me. As a writer, two things are going on that, and they're both going on at the same time. One of which is, you are doing it. You are all of your characters. You are everything. You are everything that they say. You are everything that happens. And the other is, you're the first reader. And both of those things are true. When the magic is happening, when the wind is beneath your wings, when you're lifted up, all of a sudden, it can absolutely feel like you simply are the first reader. You're the first person ever to be. hear. You can't get the words down fast enough because it's just there. And all you're doing is describing something that is being put in front of you. You have, it feels like, almost no volition or perhaps no volition at all. And that's true. And it's also true that it's you doing it. And you must never forget that it's you doing it. You never really do. And there will be bad days, and there will be good days. And the bad days will not feel like you are the magical first reader. The bad days will feel like you are a very tired bricklayer who is building a wall across a very, very long field. And And you're doing it brick by brick, which is word by word. And your process consists of going, what is the next word? Inspecting all of the possible words that you can. Oh, there's another word over here. That fits a lot better. Okay, you put it in. Oh, that'll do. And just doing that again and again. And knowing that if it's a novel, you are going to be doing that word by word 100,000 times. And that you can also feel responsible for. But sometimes you're almost too close to it. You're not going, ah, I am taking full responsibility for everything this character says. You're just trying to go, oh, my God, can you just say something that's interesting? Can you just say something? Oh, I've done another one of those scenes where it's two people in a room telling each other things they know already. Oh, for God's sake. And that's part of the writing process. And it's okay. And your frustration with yourself and your frustration with the material, it's okay. Because the weird thing, the magical thing, the absolutely unpredictable and unexpected thing is, when you get to the end. Once you've done your edits, once you've polished it up a bit, and you've handed it in to your editor at your publishing house, somewhere down the line, three months later, they will send you a manuscript, the galleys. Your job is to copy edit them and to go through them. And you'll be reading it. And you will remember that someone is going to be reading it. And it's going to reveal the truth about your past because it's brought to life byена, version been read through her and her translation here with a break, and you're going to be learning how to wake up to the new She stands in the... No, she didn't stand in the picture. OK. That's me? Yeah. Do you like that? difference between them. It all sounds like you. And that is an incredibly humbling moment. Because frankly, you think one of the two should be better. But it really isn't. It's just the book you wrote. You are always going to be rejected. As a writer, you're always going to be rejected. And that's basically healthy. But I think the great thing about being a young writer is that on the one hand, you need the humility enough to know that you don't know yet. And on the other, you need an arrogance that is normally only seen in sort of seven-year-old boys. You need that conviction that you are brilliant, that this is brilliant, that this is the greatest. That this is the greatest idea that anybody's ever had. And that by writing it, you will set the world on fire. Because that is the thing, that is the engine that is going to get you through the stuff that actually needs to be written. You need to think you're brilliant. It's okay that you're not. It's like getting people, people ask me, how do you cope with rejection? How do you cope with that? With writing a short story, writing a novel, and giving it to somebody and having it rejected. And there are only two ways to do it. One of which is you go down, you get sad, you put the thing away, you stop writing, you go and get a real job, go and do something else. And the other is a kind of crazy thing. Attitude that actually the most important thing now is to write something so brilliant, so powerful, so good, nobody could ever reject it. My friend Joe Straczynski tells me the story of when he was a young writer, he'd come to Hollywood. He wanted to write, he wanted to sell stories, he wanted to sell scripts. He was writing stuff nobody was buying anything that he wrote. And he looked up Harlan Ellison, a wonderful writer. He found Harlan's number in the Los Angeles phone book, because back then we had phone books. And he phoned Harlan and he said, hi, my name is Joe Straczynski. I'm a writer. I can't sell anything. Can you give me some advice? And Harlan, being very, very blunt, as was always Harlan's way, said, okay, let me tell you, kid. The problem is what you're writing is crap. What you have to do is write really good stuff and then you'll sell it. Okay? And he put the phone down. And what was lovely is that Joe actually took that and went, good. I've got to get better. And I've got to get so good that nobody can reject anything I write. And went on to become, you know, Oscar-nominated Joe Straczynski. But rejection, either way, is healthy. If you are a young writer, and by young, again, I mean you're starting out, it's okay to get rejected. The phrase, not quite right for us, is a really good one, because it's true. If you write something and it's not quite right for somebody, that's what they'll say. It's okay. It's just rejection. The trick is, go on. Write the next thing. Write the next thing. Write the next thing.",

Okay now, let's look at the first idea for your Reels. Mood boards and flat lays can be a great part of your content arsenal, as you are probably making them anyway, and they are so easy to share on social media. Just put your phone on a tripod and record yourself while putting a flat lay together. Use the finished flat lay as a cover image for your Reels. And add a text hook such as, come join me while making a mood board, or watch me while I work on this flat lay. Something that makes people feel that they are part of the process and curious to watch the whole Reel. If you are a virtual designer, you can also show how you are creating a digital mood board in Canva. Just use your phone to record a timelapse of you working on your computer. Add a voiceover where you explain more about why you chose the elements that you did, add some trending music in the background and you're done. And that's it. Thanks for watching. Bye. Styling tutorials are always popular, as they are the kind of content that people want to save and saving content, believe it or not, is even more important than the number of likes your content gets, as far as the algorithm is concerned. So sharing content that teaches people something new or gives them advice that they can use later is highly valuable on Instagram. With styling tutorials you can be as creative as you want. You can go crazy with transitions. You can create visual and sound effects, but you can also make them very simple if you are not that confident about your video making skills. What is important is that what you are sharing is valuable. You could also go a step further and create a series of Reels where you share, for example, how to choose a rug with different living room layouts. There are several ways how you can use this format to connect with your audience and showcase your expertise. But Q&A's are a great way how to build trust and establish yourself as an expert in your field. Start by answering frequently asked questions that your clients have about interior design. Maybe you get a lot of questions about choosing paint colors or buying furniture. You can expand on any question that you get, providing more tips and advice in your Reel.

Plus getting your favorite coffee, walking your dog, prepping your dinner, anything else that goes into your day. And who are people really getting when they choose to work with you? Don't be afraid to get personal and show what makes you and your design business unique. The purpose of a day in your life reel is to build a stronger connection with your audience and attract people who might be a good fit for your business. A before and after transformation is one of the best kinds of reels that you can create, as it shows your design skills and makes for a great scroll-stopping content. In these reels, highlight the key design changes that you made in your projects, whether it's changes to the color scheme, furniture arrangement, lighting, or anything else. You can add a voiceover or use text overlays to explain the design choices that you made and highlight the specific ideas that you made. There are a lot of different features of this space that you want to emphasize. To make your before and after reels more engaging, you can try different transitions. For example, use a swipe transition to reveal the before and after photos side by side. Or use a zoom in, slide zoom out transition to highlight the transformation of the specific details in the space. Some other transitions that you could try are a wipe transition, where you will wipe one photo with another. Or a split screen transition, where you divide a screen into two parts and show what you made in your project. Or you can add a photo with the before and after footage side by side.

Maybe you have never done an intro post, or a lot of time has passed, and you've gained new followers who don't know you that well yet. An intro reel is an opportunity to give your followers a glimpse into who you are, what inspires you, and what sets you apart, from other designers in the industry. Choose your own ratio of personal versus business information in your intro reel, but make sure that you include both. You can briefly showcase your favorite projects that you worked on, and summarize your design journey so far. Once published, you can pin your intro reel to the top of your grid, so when someone new lands on your profile, they are more likely to watch this reel and get to know you better. This is your chance to show your followers, and potential clients, what is involved in your design process, and why they should hire an expert instead of trying to do it themselves.

All of this will tell your audience that you truly are a professional, and help them gain trust in your expertise. Seasonal Styling Reels Seasonal styling reels can be about updating the decor, furniture, or color schemes to reflect the changing seasons and create a fresh and inviting look of your home.

The goal of your reels is to attract new people to your profile and make them curious to learn more about you and follow your account. Whether your reel will achieve this comes down to the quality of your footage, your editing skills and the subject of the reel. So my first tip of the day is to first set up your reel content, and play your reel like you're watching it right now! is. Think about who your ideal client is and what types of content will resonate with them. For example, if your ideal client is young families, you can talk about how to create warm and functional family spaces instead of the latest trends in high-end luxury design. Then think about how you can make your reels visually appealing. Use high-resolution videos and photos. Add text overlays, animations, and fun transitions to make people stop scrolling. Keep your reels brief and to the point. The best-performing reels are typically between 15 and 30 seconds long, so you should focus on sharing just one thing or one message in each reel. If you have more content that you would like to share, you can always break it up into multiple reels or create a series of reels to keep your audience engaged and interested in watching more. Don't be afraid to add some personality in your reels. You can include a voiceover and share some of the challenges that you encountered. During your projects or talk about the inspiration that you look up to. Adding little personal details can help build a stronger connection with your audience and make your reels more memorable. And finally, encourage your audience to take further action, whether it's to follow your Instagram profile, visit your website, or book a discovery call. Use calls to action in your reels footage as well as in your reels caption to encourage your audience to engage with your profile and take the next step towards your goals. You don't have to be an expert video maker to create content to grow your following. With just a bit of creativity and an idea of what you want to achieve, you can create great attention-grabbing reels. Take some time to experiment to see what works best for your brand.

    "data": " The age of snappy short-form video is well upon us, and it's not just for Gen Z to show off their latest TikTok dance moves. It's also a powerful medium for brands to reach mass audiences and engage in smart social media outreach. TikTok and Instagram Reels are leaders in this space, and brands who want to reach new audiences in exciting ways deserve to give short-form video a try. In this course, we'll learn about modern marketing strategies and how short-form video is a great tool to hook and engage audiences. We'll dissect what success on TikTok and Instagram Reels looks like, from storytelling strategies to working the algorithm to capitalizing on trends and leveraging influencers. I'll be incorporating interviews from brand strategists, social media marketers, influencers, various brands, TikTok creators, and more. I'm so excited to share insight from people who thrive in this ever-evolving social media space. I'm Ashley Kennedy, and I can't wait to show you the exciting possibilities of how brands can take advantage of short-form video. Let's get started. TikTok and Instagram Reels are powerful platforms where brands can apply modern marketing strategies to serve up exactly the type of content their audiences desire. And there are two strategies I primarily want to focus on in this course, brand marketing and content marketing. Now, many associate brand marketing with flashing a brand's logo to increase brand awareness. Modern brand marketing, however, goes far beyond that. It's evolved to include anything that defines a brand's identity, things like who you are, what you do, what makes you unique, what you do for a brand, and what you do for a brand. So let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started. What is your personal story and what do you promise to your customer? Executing brand marketing well by engaging in strategic creative storytelling leaves audiences with a positive impression of your brand and can make people prefer your product or brand over others. Brand marketing can often be easier to execute for companies that have been around for a while. That's because their brand identity is relatively well-known among the target audience since people have been exposed to it for years. You may already have a feeling about famous brands like Google or Apple or Disney or McDonald's. So when you have a strong brand, your brand marketing strategy can start from a place of known customer loyalty and you can build engagement from there. Smaller brands can also use brand marketing, of course, but it often means playing the long game, first building brand awareness and then securing customer loyalty. Now, what is content marketing? Content marketing is about creating valuable content to attract and retain a specific audience with the ultimate goal of driving customer engagement and action. It's about giving people what they want or need, and getting them to come back to the well again and again. Then they discover your brand along the way and hopefully consider you a trusted authority in the market. Content marketing is the polar opposite of forcing a hard sell. It's about creating content that educates, entertains or inspires without overtly trying to sell anything. But when the brand identity is subtly woven into the content, it can foster trust and leave a great impression, which can later lead to action. It's a slow burn approach that often works well on social media. Sometimes there's overlap, but brand marketing typically pushes content out to a target audience, whereas content marketing pulls in their audience by providing relevant content. Successful marketing strategies often involve a combination of both of these, and short-form video platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels are places where each approach can thrive. Audiences on these platforms tend to really care about a brand's identity and its story and appreciate when brands open up to their customers. They value transparency and love learning about the people and ideals of their brand. They value transparency and love learning about the people and ideals of their brand. They value transparency and love learning about the people and ideals of their brand. That's where brand marketing really shines. Also, because of how these platforms' algorithms work, audiences are organically served up content on their For You page or their Explore page rather than searching it out. And for this reason, content marketing is king. As audiences scroll through their feed, they engage with content that entertains, educates and inspires, and ultimately, they build brand loyalty along the way with the content that they resonate with the most. Short-form video is a perfect medium for both brand marketing and content marketing tactics. That's because effective short-form video helps you authentically present your brand, drawing audiences in by creating trust and increasing customer confidence and loyalty. That's especially important because research shows that about 90% of consumers say authenticity is important when deciding which brands they prefer. Depending on the social media platform, there are different strategies for what short-form video actually looks and feels like. Each platform contains different ideal metrics for length, format, style, and target audience. A slickly produced two-minute video on YouTube might capture millions of views, but it wouldn't be right for TikTok. There are lots of marketing sites that tout all sorts of recommendations for social media video, and these are changing and evolving all the time. Now, most platforms say shorter videos are best. And for marketing purposes, the average adult has about an eight-second attention span. So platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels are great places to cater to viewers' limited focus. That said, brands often find the most success when they have a strategy for repurposing content across multiple platforms. It's often about crafting your message around a main theme or idea. You take that idea, you turn it into a YouTube video. That YouTube video is long-form content. We can use a software to audio transcribe that and turn it into a blog post. You can take that YouTube video and you can cut it down into vertical sections. The first three verticals go on TikTok, but there's six more in there that you could put on Reels. And there's five more in there that you could put on Shorts. And especially if you structure your content well, kind of any learning format with step one, step two, step three, you can take each of those steps and put them elsewhere. And then add in a blooper reel. And that way you're doing the research and creating the work once, but you're repurposing it multiple times. Through all of this, we need to consider the marketing funnel, where content at the top is positioned to capture awareness and generate interest. Then comes consideration, where you engage your audience further so they learn more about your brand. Then there's decision, where you create content that gets your audience to respond to your call to action. And finally, there's retention, content created to keep your existing customers satisfied. TikTok and Instagram Reels videos tend to do well throughout the marketing funnel. The algorithm of TikTok's For You feed is customized to each user's personal preferences, which let people organically discover new brands and products. In fact, about two thirds of TikTokers say that the platform introduced them to a brand or product that they've not previously been aware of, which is great top of funnel success. This can come in the form of behind the scenes content, FAQ videos, top things to know videos, explainer videos, tutorials, and other educational content. Anything that you can do to get your audience to respond to your content. Anything that shows your brand as a thought leader and will intrigue people to learn more about your products and services. This TikTok from LinkedIn is great top of funnel content that engages audiences and connects with them on a personal level. Further down the funnel, brands can create content that allow users to easily discover deals and promotions resulting in those tangible conversions. Nearly 70% of users say that TikTok inspired them to shop even when they weren't looking to do so. Conversion content can include product reviews, interviews, unboxing videos, and even more. And that's the way TikTok works. So, what's the best way to get your audience to respond to your content? You can make it easier by creating a video, making it easy to review, and using the apps that you set up on your phone. You can also create a video, and if you're using a smartphone, make it easier to use that phone, and you can make it easier to get your audience to watch it and hear it on their phone. I've made my own video. I've made my own TikTok. I've made my own TikTok videos, made it easier to watch videos, interactive trends and challenges, ads and more. Here's another TikTok from LinkedIn, made by the same creator, but this time it's aimed more toward bottom of funnel initiatives and contains a clear call to action. Now calls to action can include more direct methods of conversion, especially with the advent of shoppable ads that allow users to buy products straight from the video itself. But if you're basing your strategy on the premise of content marketing, getting conversions is done subtly and strategically. What we really want to do is kind of show the utility and why you need it without telling you why you need it. We think of the question that people obviously are going to ask next. And so if they have that question, usually they go to your profile and they try and see if you have any links there. And that's where they usually now go to find out the answer. I didn't tell them to go to link in the bio, but they now assume they need to because I have their thought process from that video. There's a lot more to learn about working with TikTok and Instagram Reels, which we'll continue to uncover in this course. But just remember, by creating personal, relevant, thoughtful videos with a hook, story, and emotion, you're well on your way to getting more views, higher engagement, and hopefully more customers. Let's talk about some of the main points that you should consider when creating short form video content. Whichever platform you decide to target, first immerse yourself in the space and just watch. Search out your competitors to see what they're doing well. Which videos went viral? What types of content do you want to emulate? What do you want to do differently? What gaps do you think you can fill? At the same time, don't feel like you have to completely perfect your approach before you actually start creating content. You just need to show up and start publishing because you need to be there. And then as you're there, you're going to find your voice a little bit. But if you wait until you feel like you're ready, you're losing ground. And publishing gives you the chance to start to receive feedback. You learn what works and what doesn't work. So overall, the biggest thing that I found to be helpful was just really showing up and doing it and then kind of learning along the way. Creating compelling short form video content also means telling a good story. As you're starting out, it may seem difficult to craft a compelling 15 second narrative with a beginning, middle and an end, but it takes practice. And there are some good ways to make sure that you're condensing your narrative effectively. Five sentences, five simple sentences should give you enough time to answer that question and keep it under 15 seconds. And I say 15 seconds because on Reels and on TikTok, that's the sweet spot. I'm not saying you should never go over 15 seconds, but you usually will get people's attention, long enough if you construct your video the right way and answer that question in 15 seconds. Here's one of Virginia's TikToks that shows the strategy in action. Frustrated because you feel like your TikToks look like everyone else's? Do this to stand out. Show your face in as many videos as possible. People want to see the person behind the business. Don't use the voice to text feature. Your voice is part of your brand. Don't just post trends and have a signature look or location so people remember you. It also means leading with a strong hook that engages the viewer within the first three seconds. TikTok and Instagram Reels are fast swiping platforms. So if you don't connect with your audience right away, you'll be off their screens before you can count to, well, four. Everybody's so engaged. Everything is fast paced in our world right now. So you have a millisecond of time to be like, I'm interested. So that's personally why I use the fast paced kind of thing. I'm just hoping that I can bring somebody's eye to the stiff and be like, ooh, that's really interesting. Visuals that catch viewers' attention include interesting and close-up faces, movement, compelling graphics. Story-based hooks can include questions, intriguing statements, shocking facts, and more. And often it's important to include clear and relevant text on screen to grab attention. Also, be human. Connect with your audience with authenticity and emotion. It's an incredibly intimate platform in a way where especially with so much of the content is someone speaking into a camera. So it feels like they're talking to you. And so it should feel relatable. And it should almost feel like this person is a friend of yours that's like telling you something. I think that's why some of the content can be so captivating. And I think that's why it's so important to have a platform where you can be like, and you can be like, and you can be like, and you can be like, and you can be like, and you feel like they're teaching you something. They're letting you in on the secret. Like, oh, did you know this thing? And I think that that really grabs people and makes them feel like they're part of an in-group. This intimacy is front and center in this LinkedIn TikTok. Boy, ZBG here. And here's my three things in order to build a great personal brand. Step one, talk about the things that you're doing. The things that you experience that you invest in time in. It's easy for you to be authentic that way. And step number two, find your swagger. Talk about the unique experiences that you have that ultimately make you feel like you're in the right place. That ultimately allow you to be unique yet relatable. Number three, most importantly, as you think about what you do and your swag with it, also think about the underlying meaning of it all. And once you put it all together and understand what your messaging is, just make sure everybody knows you for it. Promote the hell out of it. So have fun with it too. Let's get it. Hey. Content-wise, it's often about anticipating your target audience's main problems or issues and serving content that addresses those needs in a user-friendly way. You may already know what some of these needs and wants are, but you may not know what they are. You may need to perform additional research to suss things out. Form focus groups with existing customers. Send surveys. Explore online forums where your audience hangs out to see what questions they're asking. Use SEO tools like SEMrush or Ubersuggest to research keywords that your target audience is using and get content ideas based on those keywords. And if you want to capture wider audiences using short-form video, you should probably consider creating diverse content types and styles. So I've learned that I can't be doing, you know, education for every single post. I have to also do some entertainment. And both ways can help build up my credibility as an expert in taking care of the skin. But all in all, it helps to win eyeballs and help to build my trust so that when I have a post that goes viral because it was a great pimple pop, those people are going to come back to my page and listen to me when I tell them, hey, remember to wear your sunscreen today. Check out that UV index. And so it's almost like being able to sneak your vegetables in, you know, with dinner or something like that. You know, I'm trying to push, you know, high-quality educational information along with my friends. So I'm trying to push, you know, high-quality educational information along with my friends. No matter what platform you focus on, if you can follow these basic tenets of short-form video, you'll set yourself up to consistently create engaging content that resonates with your target audience. I'd like to talk high-level about TikTok's place in the social media landscape. And I'll begin by talking about what makes TikTok unique. TikTok videos are full-screen, full-sound, immersive, autoplay content optimized for discovery, resulting in very high user engagement. And it's not just dance trends and lip tubs. TikTok creators feature DIY tutorials, brand stories, behind-the-scenes videos of how products are made, personal vlogs, product commentary, and more. There are countless ways that brands can reach their audiences. TikTok is an especially interesting platform because of anyone's ability to go viral. Its algorithm provides a relatively level playing field among creators. So anyone can post a video, and it can explode in popularity, exposing your video and your story, your message, and your brand to massive audiences, exposing your video and your story, your message, and your brand to massive audiences. exposing your video and your story, your message, and your brand to massive audiences, far beyond your personal connections. That's a really great opportunity for people and brands new to the platform. Justin Baer of Collars & Co. invented a polo dress shirt, basically a comfortable, stretchy polo shirt with a formal English spread collar. He went through the process of creating dozens of prototypes, then made a whole lot of shirts, and then he created a TikTok video. He released it into the world, even though he had no following on TikTok at all. It was amazing. I mean, it just kind of blew up. We sold out in 24 hours, and it really kind of gave creativity and confidence to the idea as a whole. It really wasn't for this TikTok to go well. I don't know if we would all be here. Now we have a warehouse, we've got employees. So much has happened from this one small, kind of silly TikTok video that I made in my closet with no lights. It's just very organic. Part of the reason TikToks can go viral far beyond the existing network is because, at heart, it's a discovery platform. It's For You page is built on an algorithm that promises to serve up personalized content to users based on who they are, who they follow, and what type of content they most engage with. This lets brands organically appear in people's feeds that align the most closely with their target demographic. Another great benefit is that you don't need professional skills or equipment. In fact, polished videos are actually often looked down upon. Instead, TikTokers prefer relatively rudimentary production quality. All you need is a phone. You can create the entire video within the user-friendly TikTok app. These tools are democratizing content creation in a way that we've never seen before. Everyone can become a content creator, and it's so much easier when you have a platform that allows you to create content that's so much easier when you use it. You just press a button and suddenly you have multiplied on the screen or there is a video where you're reacting to it next. These are things where previously you have to go in a video editing tool on an expensive computer and do these in post-production. And so I think by reducing the friction, it's just unlocking so much creativity because you don't need this technical expertise to be a really great content creator. You can really just let that creativity come forward. Let's talk a bit more about the TikTok audience. TikTok is notoriously aimed at the Gen Z crowd. About a third of users are aged 10 to 19, and a little less than a third are in their 20s. So that's two thirds of users aged 30 and under, a heavy Gen Z and millennial skew. Still, that means that one third of users are over 30. And with TikTok's ability to expertly target audience demographics, don't discount it as a tool to reach all ages. The habits and values of this audience influence a lot about TikTok's style and approach. Number one, TikTokers crave connection. They want brands to meet audiences online, to show their expertise on their level, and show their raw, personal human side. In general, brands should simplify, shed any corporate persona, and tell the story behind the brand to show your company as committed, authentic, and trustworthy. There isn't a playbook for TikTok at all. So you really just have to put yourself out there and see what sticks. I think one of our biggest successes in terms of our mission and to show people that Chipotle serves real food has been our recipe videos. But we've been really lighthearted and playful with them. So just not being too serious and having fun, and playing with different formats and trends and sounds has always been super successful for us. I'm back with another Chipotle hack. This is the queso brisket with a spicy queso dip in our new smoked brisket. So you're going to get a brisket quesadilla with a side of hot red salsa, a side of green salsa, and a side of queso. After that, you're going to mix a little bit of that hot salsa into that queso to make spicy queso. Then you know what to do. Dip your queso brisket into that spicy queso and add a little bit of that green salsa just to mellow it out. Seriously, you guys have to try it. It's so good. Also, follow for some more menu hacks. Here's one of Chipotle's viral TikToks that shows the light side of the brand. in a fun way. Post a video that made you go viral. Audience engagement on TikTok is among the highest of any social media platform. On TikTok, on average, TikTokers spend nearly 90 minutes per day scrolling through their feed. That said, it's still important to keep things short and snappy. More than 60% of videos with the highest click-through rates successfully feature their main message within the first three seconds. So for brands whose products and services align with this hyper-engaged audience and want to take advantage of a highly discoverable platform, TikTok can be a great opportunity to leverage strategic marketing initiatives. In this course, we're exploring TikTok-style short-form video, a format that empowers brands to use TikTok to tell concise, authentic stories. And one of the major competitors in this space is Instagram Reels. Now, Instagram has been an incredibly popular social media platform for a while, and it constantly explores how to leverage trends to cater to their audience, like when they launched Instagram Stories to compete with Snapchat. So in late 2019, when they launched a pilot of Reels in direct competition with TikTok, it was a clear move to capitalize on the momentum of the immersive short-form video format. Instagram Reels is also a full-screen, full-sound, immersive platform, and offers access to Instagram filters and in-app editing tools. Reels is a central component of the app as its own separate entity, and it's also integrated with other parts of the platform, like within Instagram Stories and via the Explore feed. Much like TikTok's For You page, Instagram Reels aims to show users personalized content based on their habits and preferences. Again, this is a great formula for brands that want their content to organically appear in users' feeds that best align with target demographics. As we look at the future of Instagram Reels, we see that the market is now more aligned with target demographics. As with TikTok, authenticity is key. Successful Instagram Reels content often shows brands' human sides that establish you as an authority in the marketplace. I can't show up on video. How am I supposed to show up on video when my life is so messy right now? You don't. Don't show up or don't show up happy? Both. Show up on the days you emotionally can. Share your struggle one day and how you got through it. It's up to you when you do it and how much you choose to share. We could do a video about that. We just did. Oh. This can include brand stories, creative product videos, mini vlogs, user-generated videos, how-to videos, hacks and tips, unboxing videos, customer testimonials, and more. Like TikTok, Reels has a relatively short learning curve to get started. It's easy to begin using Instagram's built-in tools to engage a similarly-minded online culture. And if you've already got TikTok content that you want to bring over to Instagram Reels, you can repurpose it. We'll talk about how to do this smartly later in the course. For brands who are totally new to short-form video, but who already do have an Instagram presence, Reels can be a comfortable springboard into this space. You can leverage your existing Instagram network and begin tackling this content in a familiar setting rather than learning a brand-new platform like TikTok. Also, if you examine video engagement statistics, Reels videos do see higher average engagement than Instagram's main feed videos. So if you're exploring short-form video as a medium to tell your brand's story, Reels can often give you a bigger return. So as you develop your social media strategy, especially if you've already got an Instagram presence, consider Reels to extend your brand's reach. We've talked about what it takes to create compelling short-form video. Telling a good story, being authentic and personal, leading with a strong hook, and anticipating your audience's needs and wants. Beyond that, though, succeeding with TikTok means creating content that is entertaining, educational, or inspirational. After all, TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. If those values are infused in your TikTok engagement strategy, you'll be in good shape. Of course, knowing how to tell a great story in a short period of time is crucial. And that just takes practice. The most important thing that I tell people is if you don't know how to make videos on TikTok, force yourself to make 15-second videos because that's going to teach you how to make a hook really fast. Because nobody really knows how to make 15-second content unless you train yourself. And you've got to find a way to say exactly what you need to say within two seconds or you're done. Because you won't even have enough time to teach or talk about anything else. There are some useful tools that can help you quickly and efficiently tell your story. Text overlays are great ways to highlight the main piece of your narrative. Or the voice-to-text voiceover feature is another device that many people use in TikTok's full sound environment. Good storytelling is important no matter the content type. So even if your goal is to provide educational content, always be mindful of the story and the personality you use to deliver your tips. If you get too tipsy, meaning all you do is give tips, and people don't see the real you behind the scenes, you're not as memorable. You don't stand out. The sticky content is the content that weaves storytelling into the tips. Or you weave entertainment into the tips. It doesn't mean you have to do dances and lip dubs and even characters, which I like to do. But it means you've got to figure out a way to explain your tips in an entertaining way. Take a look at these fun tips from Virginia, infused with loads of storytelling and personality. Videos are us. Every time I go on video, I look like... A stick in the mud. Yes. That's the camera sucking out 25% of your personality. You've got to be you but more. Stand up. Smile. Lean into the camera. Now stay hydrated. Staying hydrated will help you increase your creativity, your energy, and sound strong and confident. Think big, juicy, great. Not small, dried out raisin. Okay, bye-bye. Also, be mindful of who you choose to speak for your brand. There's a lot of nuance here. But if you decide on someone, that person, that face, is who your audience is going to connect with. But once you show a face, like once you hire me to make videos for you, you have to realize, like, is it more important for us to hire Caleb for the long term, or are we just not going to connect with our audience? And that's a really important thing, most especially with TikTok. If you're getting on TikTok, the most important thing you have to do is connect with your audience. You connect with them best if you show a face and they interact with their audience. And you have to think long term, how are we planning on doing that? Certainly, some successful TikTok content doesn't show faces and instead relies on creative, behind-the-scenes footage. You can experiment with lots of fun filters and effects to engage audiences for major returns. I like to make videos that are fun. I like to make videos that are behind the scenes. And the fact that they're seeing that it's not a machine made, it's handmade, and putting my own time and thought process into everything that I'm doing. It takes time, you know, and people are just noticing that when you put your heart and soul into something and the authenticity into it, you know, people really appreciate that. And it's really great to see that. It's also usually important to embrace music because it's central to the social fabric of TikTok. Of course, there are rules here. All music must be licensed. You can buy the music rights or work with the musician to create music. Or do what most people do and select songs from TikTok's library, which can be a great strategic connector to other creators and content since so many TikToks use the same music. There's also some fun structural techniques on TikTok. Because TikToks automatically replay, you'll often see the last line of narration tie perfectly to the first line of narration to form a seamless loop. Also, editing on cues, like to a specific music beat, or executing a creative transition is very popular. This takes practice. By watching other videos and experimenting in-app, you'll improve quickly. Here's a fun TikTok transition from LinkedIn. Also, be open to interacting with and mentioning other brands on TikTok so you can take advantage of the ways that TikTok directs traffic to different accounts. Now, if you like, you know, my facial serum, but I don't have a really good cleanser in my lineup, you might love this brand that does. And by at-tagging them, not only are you helping a customer, you know, explore the internet, but some of their traffic is kind of tied or linked to you. And through that link, new people can find you because of that. And people can find you because of TikTok's recommendation feed. Next, make sure you're a reliable and relatively frequent content creator. The best performing TikTok brands post between three and four times per week on average. TikTok audiences have certain expectations and you need to make sure you can deliver. Finally, strategically cross-post your content on your other platforms to create awareness and invite followers over to your new space on TikTok. And while some small degree of content duplication between platforms may be okay, it's actually not very well tolerated with the TikTok crowd. If TikTokers notice you're not creating unique content, they'll often unfollow you, which goes back to where we started. Keep things authentic and audience focused and you'll set yourself up for success. Let's talk about the TikTok algorithm and how you can leverage it to grow your brand. The TikTok algorithm works so that if a video sees high user engagement among a small subset of users, then it will gradually be circulated to more and more users on the platform. They're always going to send it out to a handful of people. If that does well, then they're going to send it out to a lot more people. If that does well, then they're going to send it out to a lot more people. If that does well, then they're going to send it out to a lot more people. If you want theonnate Fortnow nenodes, send the first piece of content to three. If you want theonnante Fortnow nenodes, send the first piece of content to three. If that does well, then they're going to send it out to more people who look like those people. And it's going to go up in first like 300 to a thousand, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions. And that's kind of how it works. And you can see that happening live with your videos. And so that's why you'll see it go up in views in like stops. And so that's why you'll see it go up in views in like stops. And then it'll go up the next day in stops. And you're like you were actually watching the algorithm work and you have to be patient. You're like you were actually watching the algorithm work and you have to be patient. The TikTok algorithm is unique because the main page, the For You page, isn't actually composed of accounts you necessarily follow. It's a personalized feed of videos that TikTok thinks that you'll like based on your preferences and your video engagement history, as well as more diverse content that's been received well by others who share your interests. TikTok's goal is to hook you with lots of content that you love so that you keep scrolling and engaging. In that sense, it's different from platforms like Facebook, which mostly shows you content you follow, or YouTube, which gets most of its traffic through user searches. TikTok's content is served up to a relatively passive audience, but to an audience who is right for engagement and who may choose to follow you if they like your content. When brands' content appears on the highly coveted For You page, it can mean significant increases in exposure without spending money on ads. So if you typically get several hundred views on a TikTok video, that could increase to tens of thousands or millions of views if it catches fire on the For You page. And there are certain ways to optimize your content so the algorithm can keep you up to date. Now, let's talk about what the algorithm actually looks at. First, video engagement. That is, videos with lots of likes, comments, and shares. So you may want to structure your content with audience engagement as a goal, like by asking users to use the comment section to answer a question or contribute their own experiences on the topic. There's also built-in TikTok features called Duet and Stitch, where other users can interact directly with your content. When others duet or stitch your video, that rises it in the ranks of the algorithm. Another big metric is video completion rate. That means that if most users watch your TikTok to the end without swiping away, it's much more likely to get picked up by the algorithm. What's one big way to have a high video completion rate? Make shorter, engaging videos with a compelling hook right at the beginning. And if your video is so good that it's getting watched more than once, that's algorithm gold. You also need to label your video with good tech space information. That means including the right hashtags and trending sounds and compelling captions. These labels help the algorithm know what your video is about. We'll talk more about hashtags and metadata later, but for now, I'll just say that you'll likely need to experiment to find the right hashtag strategy. And as far as your captions go, you only have 100 characters, so make them count. Many times this means asking questions in the captions, or creating mystery by tapping into users' curiosity. It can even be as simple as including a promise of a payoff at the end by writing, just wait until the end. A smaller, less important metric involves user information like language preference, country setting, and device type, so that the algorithm can match up content to people with the same language and country setting, so that the algorithm can match up content to people with the same language and country setting, so that the algorithm can match up content to people with the same language and country setting, for example. Now, each of these factors is weighted differently. A video with high engagement ranks much higher in the algorithm than a video that simply matches device and country information. As you work the algorithm, you can strategically alter certain aspects of your video to see if you can improve performance. If it doesn't do well, I can look at things I can change now. Just change one thing in the next video, and then see how it performs. You don't need to have an emotional attachment to it. You need to have a data mindset to it of, let's just move on to the next one, that one didn't work. When you work the algorithm game, and your content is incrementally shown to wider and wider audiences via the For You page, that's when you'll quickly gain new followers, which is great for exposure, brand awareness, and getting customers. And part of the way you get there is to post as consistently as possible. Now that we know a little more about how TikTok's recommendation system works, let's continue learning how you can create videos that will be picked up by this unique algorithm. On TikTok, hashtags help segment content so your videos are categorized and searchable. They also help tell the TikTok algorithm what your content is about, which helps get your video in front of the right audience. They also help identify your competitors and industry connections. And if you use them right, they can expand your reach, which can help you get more followers. First up, segmenting content. Creators use hashtags to categorically label and organize videos. Users then click on those hashtags to discover related content. Essentially, this opens up portals to other users who can then discover your content. Now, we already mentioned that TikTok stands for auto-segmenting. Though we're a bit different from most other platforms, content isn't always the same, and it's not just a matter of preference. It's more about each and every one of us. For doing content, you need to be really creative. If you're thinking about your content, you need to be really creative. Now, we already mentioned that TikTokers don't typically do a lot of searching. Rather, they're largely served up personalized content via the For You page. So in that sense, hashtags might not be as useful as they are on other search-centric platforms. However, many users do click on hashtags to discover content, so there's certainly value there. TikTok does have a Discover page, where users can peruse popular videos, and this is organized by trending hashtags with the most popular videos listed at the top of each hashtag group. So again, if you've already got a popular video, you can get more views by adding trending hashtags and securing a high spot on that Discover page. Another value of hashtags is to help feed the algorithm by telling TikTok what your video is about. That's only part of the equation, though. A good caption is often just as important. Again, you've only got 100 characters for your caption and hashtags together, so make those keywords count. You can also use hashtags to position yourself within the competitive marketplace. To determine which hashtags to use, research what other people in your industry are using. When you do this, you're not only positioning your content well within that social space, but you're joining a community, which can be a good thing for your brand identity and your discoverability. And one way to differentiate your brand is to create your own branded hashtag. So if you've got a popular type of content on TikTok, create a unique hashtag so users can find similar content that you've created in the past. And if you create a branded hashtag challenge or competition and it takes off, you could literally go viral overnight. Often, this may take partnering with influencers to get that type of traction. Here's a TikTok from Chipotle that references multiple viral hashtag campaigns. From the people who brought you hashtag Chipotle, sponsor me. It's hashtag Chipotle creator. 14 of your favorite creators have already been selected, but we're looking for 15. Introducing Chipotle Creator Class 2022. Featuring free Chipotle and this Chipotle Creator Class plaque. Also opportunities to get the bag. What does that mean? I'm 37. And access to our test kitchen. Plus many more opportunities. To enter, make a Chipotle themed video. Hashtag Chipotle Creator and hashtag entry and post between 9-9 and 9-13. We're waiting. Make sure your hashtags are clear, relevant, and easily searchable. It's best to have a mix of niche hashtags, global hashtags, and trending hashtags to cover your bases. After all, you want to anticipate the keywords that people will actually use to discover your content. But you also want to have specific hashtags that speak more closely to your content. And to learn about your content, you need to have a clear, relevant, and easily searchable hashtag. To learn about trending hashtags, search the Discover page to get some ideas. And to check hashtag popularity, you can type it into the TikTok search bar and it will show you how many views each hashtag has. And if you want to use a third-party hashtag generator that uses AI to suggest the best options, check out tools like Hashtag Expert. As you're zeroing in on your hashtag strategy, you can run tests. That is, share two very similar videos and keep everything else the same. Same type of content, same time of day, but with different hashtags. And if you have a TikTok Pro account, you'll be able to see how many viewers got to your content through your hashtags. One tip. Many people add the hashtag FYP or hashtag For You page to their video because they think it will get them landed on the For You page. However, it's been all but confirmed that this really doesn't do much. So save your hashtag space for keywords that speak better to your content. There's one last thing I want to say about hashtag etiquette. Don't use high-traffic hashtags that aren't applicable to your brand or content. TikTokers don't tolerate that type of behavior well, so you could end up negatively impacting your brand. Also, it's possible that TikTok may hide your content if you're flagged as an account who regularly uses non-relevant hashtags. Trends are those popular, ever-changing cultural movements that take TikTok by storm. They can include things like making a video using a certain filter or effect, or doing a dance or skit, or creating a video to a certain trending sound, or lip-syncing a song. The key is, thousands of people do it. All in their own way. The key is, thousands of people do it. All in their own way. The key is, thousands of people do it. All in their own way. Challenges are a subset of trends, when people respond to a call to action and post it with a challenge hashtag. Challenges usually involve a song or dance move, or completing some type of task or activity. The TikTok algorithm tends to favor trends and challenges on the For You page, so popular ones can result in more exposure than other organic content. Trends and challenges are like a social glue that creates a strong sense of community. When thousands of people are trying out something new, singing to the same song, sharing ideas, and participating in challenges, it bolsters strong feelings of personal connection. It's all about the unique way that you contribute to the mass collaborative effort. Here's one popular trend of people running away from something they're afraid of, where influencer Cassandra Bankson runs away from various skincare industry trends. Here's another trend from influencer Dustin Bertella, where he incorporates the trending sound of a gunshot into his own skincare industry niche. It's for others to basically take the mantra that you learn in an improv class, where it's like you set the scene and you never say no, you say yes and. And I think the TikTok features allow you to improvise more than some of the other platforms on the content that you already see. And because of that, I think that's why trends stick and why they have that such high memory effect, because people can collaborate on the same solo piece of content more and more that allows that one trend to continue to get larger and larger and larger for basically the entire community to reap the benefits and see the return on investment on a certain trend. And when brands jump into the mix, that added sense of authenticity can be a breath of fresh air. Participating in trends can help others relate to you on a personal level and support your business. Because we want a fully developed brand personality. We don't just want a front-facing one-dimensional brand. We want a fully developed one. And by doing trends, it helps you look more like a normal person. You can be funny, you can be smart, you can be nice now with trends. And other business owners who have gone through the same thing now relate to you and are more likely to buy from you. You don't always have to follow the pack though. If you've got an original idea for a challenge related to your brand, that can be a fun way to engage your followers and reach new audiences because of the open invitation to participate. It's something that shouldn't be forced though. Only do trends that align with your brand. There are a couple of factors that may result in successful trends. First, be early. The timing of trends can be tricky because of how fast they blow up and how fast they fade away. So agile brands that trust their creative team can often jump on a trend and possibly hit that viral wave. Don't be afraid to take risks and to experiment and to fall on your face and just, keep trying and also just make sure you're reducing any kind of bureaucracy, red tape or approvals that you need to get that content out there. Things are moving quickly and if you do want to jump on more timely things, it could be over by the time you've gotten the right sign-offs. Another factor for trend success is to be creative and personal in your approach. People want to see how unique and fun you are and how you make the trend different from everyone else. And to really know how you can be different, you first need to see what else is out there. So find trends that other brands in your industry have already done. If there's an obvious way you can put your own spin on it, explore that. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. It's also important to not only do trends. It's often about using them strategically, but sparingly. So I'm not opposed to trends, but I call them training wheels. And you gotta lose the training wheels, because like I said, we want to be authentic, we want people to feel like they know us, and we want to be remembered. And you doing a trend that everybody else is doing, they might get a great tip out of your text bubble that you pointed to, but they're less likely to go to your account and start binging your other videos if all you're doing is throwing out trends. Or if they go to your account and all you've got are trends, you're not building that trust, and you're not going to be able to convert them into a customer as easily. So pepper in the trends, but take the training wheels off and start using your real voice and coming up with a unique way of sharing your expertise. Trends are the lifeblood of TikTok's ever-growing trend. So keep an eye open for ones that might align with your brand. Jumping into this space can be tricky, and you might not hit it right at first. But as with anything, it's about trial and error until you create something that your followers love, which can then spark fire within the greater TikTok community. TikTok influencers are successful TikTok creators that often have mass followings. For brands, partnering with influencers can be a great strategy to get help creating valuable, strategic content. And if you're a TikTok influencer, you can also use your brand to create a brand that will attract new customers. If done smartly, working with the right influencers will increase your reach and attract new customers. They're sort of the modern celebrity endorsement, but with more strategy and deeper connection. You know, the whole thing about celebrity endorsements is that they used to be idealistic, aspirational. But influencers, this is, you know, your sister. This is your cousin. These are people that you work with. And so social media has a way of personalizing all of this. And who would you rather take advice from? A celebrity who promotes everything or someone that you feel is like a friend? So that parasocial relationship or being able to feel like you understand someone and that they're honest with you? That goes a long way in consumer trust and behavior. Good influencers have a deep understanding of how TikTok works and what the TikTok community wants. But it's not just about partnering with the ones with the most followers. You need to partner with the right influencers, those that align well with your brand, who can work with you to capture the right audience and accomplish your goals. Before collaborating on sponsored content with influencers, you should, of course, already have a deep understanding of your target audience's habits and preferences. What other influencers does your target audience like? What type of content do they most enjoy? Now, you can find influencers organically by searching the app through various hashtags. You can also Google top TikTok creators along with some keywords from your industry niche to locate popular influencers. Or you can use the TikTok creator marketplace, which is designed to match up brands with creators. Once you find potential influencers that serve your industry, it's important to do your homework. Try to get a sense of how they show up. What type of content do they typically create? What vibe do they give? Are they authentic? Are they creative? Do they seem trustworthy? What other brands do they partner with? Also, cross-check them on other platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and more. It's important to know how they show up across the social media spectrum. Now, when you approach influencers for a possible partnership, come in with clarity, as well as with openness. So communicate your strategy, objectives, deliverables, and deadlines. But also, trust the influencers to innovate. When a brand is approaching a creator because they want to feature their product or products, the brand is approaching them usually because that creator has enjoyed some success on social media. They already have a voice, they have a followership, they have good engagement. And when the brand provides a set of talking points, certain things they'd like to get across, but they really leave the creator to have control over how the message is crafted, the post is usually going to do a lot better. I've had other partnerships where I felt like the whole thing was written and I was supposed to repeat it verbatim from somebody on the marketing department, and it really didn't allow me to share the brand's message. Or product in my own voice. And my followers could tell, and the post typically didn't perform as well. I think authenticity is absolutely key when working with influencers. We never want our post to feel super, you know, hashtag sponsored or hashtag ad. It's really important for us to partner really closely with the creator to make the best possible content there. And we really trust creators. We, you know, we know that they know what's best, what's best for their platform and their channel, and they're the experts at TikTok. So we have a really collaborative process with creators, which I absolutely love and such a pleasure to work with so many of them. It's important to budget smartly for influencer collaboration. In general, TikTok influencers charge based on how many followers they have and how much exposure they can expect to get for you. So the bigger the influencer, the bigger the cost. It's not always the best tactic to put all your funds toward one influencer, however. Spreading your resources out among multiple micro influencers can be a great strategy. And what's cool about TikTok is that if you get a bunch of influencers together and you say, okay, we're going to start out with this one influencer, maybe she's got 250,000 or a million followers, but we're going to pay 10 micro influencers the same amount as we paid this one big one, but we're going to have them react to hers or duet hers or stitch hers or use the same audio, you're all of a sudden getting this really good trend to be picked up and hopefully it's getting recommended to people's feeds because the first person has the big following to kind of spark things. And then the next five or 10 are kind of being discovered through the algorithm. There's of course lots of methods for working with influencers, but however you choose to approach it, just make sure the creators align with your brand, your values, and your goals. And together you can achieve exciting results. In addition to all the ways we've already talked about using the TikTok platform, brands may also want to engage in paid media integration to widen their reach. In other words, creating ads. TikTok ads are a great way to automate the process of creating, delivering, and optimizing paid content. The built-in insight reports and ad management tools offer valuable customization so that you can target the right audience and get results. Now, one very important thing to consider when creating TikTok ads is to keep to TikTok style guidelines in creating organic content. TikTokers tend to reject anything that doesn't seem like genuine TikTok content. So ads should feel authentic and homemade and look native to the feed. In other words, you want to make ads that don't look like ads. You can see that TikTok communicates this front and center. Don't make ads, make TikToks. There are currently five types of TikTok ads that I'd like to cover here. In-feed ads, brand takeover, top view, branded hashtag challenge, and branded effects. In-feed ads appear on the For You page in between other TikTok videos. Users can like and comment and share and interact with your video just like any other TikTok content. Keep in mind, users can swipe away from them very quickly, so you need to capture that attention within the first two to three seconds. It can often be a great idea to work with influencers on in-feed ads since they know the platform so well. Brand takeover ads are full-screen videos that appear when you first open the app. They're presented to your target audience and are an effective way to create mass awareness for top-of-funnel goals. Users won't see more than one brand takeover ad per day, so brands are assured that they'll get lots of views without lots of competition. They're expensive, but they can be great options for larger brands with big marketing budgets. Top view ads are similar to brand takeovers, except that they don't appear right away when users open the app. Rather, they're the first in-feed post after three seconds. They're full-screen ads that appear at the top of the For You page so they get lots of viewers. Branded hashtag challenges are one of the most unique types of ads. They're a lot like regular trending hashtag challenges, except it's about letting brands dictate what they are. That is, brands come up with a hashtag challenge and they don't have to hope it goes viral. TikTok promotes the hashtag, and brands get creative with the campaigns, creating organic content, working with influencers, and inviting plenty of user-generated content. And when users click on a branded hashtag, they go to a landing page that shows the most popular videos with that hashtag along with a link to the brand's website. Finally, there's branded effects, which comes in the form of branded stickers, AR filters, and more. Brands get to design their own custom filters and let users engage with your brand in a fun way. When you create TikTok ads, and when you create sponsored content with influencers, you need to disclose its promotional nature. In the past, many creators added hashtags like hashtag ad or hashtag sponsored. But now, there's a branded content toggle available for selected accounts that let you turn on a small logo bug in the lower left corner below the caption. These rules are always changing, so make sure that you're aware of the disclosure requirements if you engage in paid promotions. There's a lot of options for how you approach running ads on TikTok, but getting started is relatively simple. Go to the TikTok ads signup page to register and get approved by TikTok. Then, you'll have access to TikTok Ads Manager, and you can work with representatives from TikTok to create ad campaigns, zero in on your target audience, and more. Caleb Roberts, who has a TikTok ad agency, says he encourages brands to use their own profiles to test different videos' success as organic content, which is free, before converting them to paid ads, where you can then take advantage of the analytics tools. Basically testing out content for free. We can post 20 videos on TikTok, and if any of them get a good amount of views, then we know we should upload those to the backend of TikTok ads, and we can now run those, and we can gauge how many purchases we got by the day that we uploaded that video on the organic profile. And then we can look at the comments to look at the audience and see who's sharing it and who's not, and what they're saying about the video, and if they like the product. And so it's a great way of doing it for free. If you decide to create ads, you're in for a unique journey that's pretty different from other social media advertising processes. But embrace it. It's about creating authentic TikTok content that most people don't actually even realize are ads. And that's a pretty fun way to promote your brand. We've talked about how to leverage the TikTok platform to bolster your brand and reach larger audiences. Here, I just want to cover a hodgepodge of other tactics that brands should be aware of as they create their TikTok strategy. First, let's talk about content. The culture of comments on TikTok not only allows your audience to engage with your brand and with one another, but it also lets you interact directly with people in a way that can draw them to learn more and engage with your brand. Comments is like the best part about TikTok. It is so funny. Sometimes comments are funnier than the actual video themselves. So just showing up, and whether it's a Chipotle-related video or one that's not necessarily related to Chipotle, showing up in an unexpected way in the comments is really awesome. You can get thousands of followers just from having one really funny comment because people are like, oh, you know, I didn't know Chipotle had a TikTok. Let me go check it out. Then they'll go through your content and see what's happening. But I think the best part about commenting for a brand is that it's an amazing way to create community and to chat with your fans and to show them that you're listening and you're there and that you care. TikTok comments aren't just text-based. You can actually reply with another TikTok video. This offers another layer of interactivity and personal touch that users love. And the way it works is really interesting. When you reply to a comment, it's not only viewable in the comments section, but it also creates a brand new video on your page. And you can attach the original comment to the video so that users can see what you're responding to. This is an exciting way for brands to show users they care. You can also respond to users with a live video, another great engagement tool. The person who asked the question, assuming that it's a positive response, feels seen. They feel like you're talking to them. The next thing is, most likely, if that person asked, then other people have the same question. So you're building that audience and you're building that rapport with them because they're listening. You're answering a question that someone else already had. Next, I want to talk a bit about two features, Duet and Stitch. These are built-in tools that allow creators to interact and engage with others on the platform. The Duet is two people side by side or two images side by side, and you can either react or speak over someone else. And then the Stitch is taking someone else's content and then cutting it and then providing follow-up. So almost like step one, step two. And because those are built into the platform, they're a little bit more organic. And I think they really do foster that growth in communities. And the reason why is because of companionship and being coworkers, not competition. And I think that if you can find people, you know, in your niche as well, learn from them, support them. If they enjoy what you're talking about in learning social media, they might like me too. And if they enjoy what I'm saying, they might like you. Doesn't mean they're going to unfollow me just to follow you. It's also a great idea to lean on user-generated content. That's any content involving your brand that you didn't necessarily partner with someone on. But often, TikTokers will engage with a brand or product and then post a video about it. And you don't want to miss the opportunity to use that. User-generated content is incredible. And we are constantly monitoring, you know, the trends we see and the content we see about Chipotle. So every day we actually have a TikTok standup meeting with our teams where we're reviewing, you know, the most popular videos, videos that were tagged in and how we want to comment and engage. So sometimes that can spark ideas on our team's end. So I think you really just have to be in there, be in the weeds, understand the platform, and constantly monitor for stuff because you will get so much inspiration to create new content, to engage, or to repost. Finally, I want to mention that we have a lot of TikTok creation sounds. They're a huge part of TikTok culture. And normally it's about finding sounds that you can create videos to go along with. But what if you create your own sounds? Sounds are really important because if you can create your own sound, you can almost create a trend. You know, there's a sound of like three things that I will never buy again. Great. Anybody can use that for almost any industry. And if you're the one who created that with a really cool beat or a catchphrase, you know, you start off in a niche, but it starts to take off. So if you can create a piece of music that people love, that is awesome. Or even if you can just create a verbal, you know, a piece of noise that people can kind of jump onto and latch onto, I think that is one of the most untapped TikTok growth hacks that people aren't currently using that we have found major success with. There are so many ways that you can use various engagement tools to reach your audience on TikTok. Explore which ones make sense for your brand strategy and try them out. We talked a lot about what makes successful TikTok content. Now let's take what we've learned and relate it to the other major short-form video leader in this space, Instagram Reels. By and large, the authentic content, style, and tone of TikToks is a key. TikToks do extremely well on Instagram. So if you do the things that make great TikToks, you'll likely end up with great Reels content too. Now if you do a deeper comparison between the platforms, though, you'll see that Reels content does tend to be a bit more polished and produced, whereas TikTok is more raw and spontaneous. Even in Reels, we've seen this trend of filters do better on Instagram Reels. This more idealistic life does better on Instagram Reels. So if you are someone who has a polished brand, or if you do a lot of photography work, or if your brand does, that might do better on Instagram Reels. Let's talk about a few similarities and differences between the platforms, as well as best practices related to those observations. First, I'd like to talk a bit about the built-in tools within each platform with regard to how it affects social culture. As of now, TikTok has more advanced built-in editing features than Reels. At least part of this is because there are more third-party plugins built specifically for TikTok. Certainly, Instagram does offer a nice suite of creative tools, including augmented reality filters, speed controls, transition tools, and more. But the thing is, many TikTok trends stem from very specific TikTok effects and techniques. So if you're trying for something similar in Reels, you may be limited and not easily able to replicate it. That said, Instagram-originated trends that use Reels' built-in effects are becoming more popular, so keep your eye out for those. Also, a lot of the audio on Reels voiceovers, sound effects, and music comes straight from TikTok videos. This can perhaps be seen as both good and bad for Reels engagement. On one hand, it's sort of a bad thing, because it's a built-in content generator. But on the other hand, Reels does inherently rely on TikTok to spur a lot of its viral content. Also, because Instagram currently has stricter music copyright rules than TikTok, you may sometimes be limited in what types of audio you can use. So it's an interesting relationship. And some of this may not matter much if you don't already have a TikTok presence. However, if you are already on TikTok and you're looking to expand into Instagram Reels, you do have some options. You could, of course, just export TikTok videos to your YouTube channel, and upload them straight to Instagram. However, Instagram doesn't really like this approach, and won't promote TikTok-branded videos in their algorithm. There are a few ways around this, one being to simply download the video from TikTok to your phone, then use a TikTok logo remover, and then upload it to Instagram. Another way to go is to create the video in a third-party mobile video editing program, like InShot or Splice, so there's no watermark to begin with. Then the content can live on both platforms without any issue. As a rule, however, it's generally not recommended to just upload duplicate content to multiple platforms. If you don't have the bandwidth and you're trying to see what sticks, what's sticky, that's a great suggestion and something you should do. But simultaneously, once you start to get some traction, think about the viewer's perspective. I see the same thing on LinkedIn. I see the same thing again on TikTok. I see the same thing on YouTube Reels and Shorts. I see the same thing everywhere. I'm like, this is annoying. I don't want to see the same thing 10 times, and I unfollow. So if you can make each thing slightly different, that's how you can actually start to grow and tell someone, hey, follow me on this platform too, because I provide something different. And whether or not you already have a TikTok presence, I do think it's beneficial to at least know what's working well on TikTok. After all, there's a very high correlation between viral TikToks and viral Reels. So if you've got a good handle on what's working well in TikTok, you can use that to your advantage to create your Reels content. Let's talk about why Instagram Reels can be a great place for brands to engage their social media strategy. First, Reels is a perfect way to get people to follow you. It's a perfect place to share your brand message if your target audience is already on Instagram. If you've got an Instagram presence, or if you've done your market research and have identified that large portions of your audience use Instagram, it only makes sense to meet them where they are. Using the proven formula of snappy, engaging, short-form videos to educate, entertain, and inspire your audience, all while highlighting your brand's personality and values, can turn Instagram followers into loyal customers. And again, it's all about anticipating the needs and wants of your target audience. And I know that when I put this Reel out today, I know it's going to have impact. Because I know my ideal person goes through the same stuff I go through, and she thinks the same stuff I go through, and so that makes me relatable, but it also is going to give her a lesson. I always make sure there's a happy ending and something that she can take and apply to her life at the end of the video. People, please just express. I don't know how to take a compliment. That top looks great on you. I love that color with your eye. This? I've had it for years and it's so tired looking. Don't reject a compliment. It makes you look insecure and rude, not humble. Instead, thank you. I've never thought of this as one of my colors. I appreciate you pointing that out. Also, if you do already have a respectable Instagram presence, it's to your advantage to give Reels a shot. Instagram rewards creators who use each of their in-app features. That is, the algorithm prioritizes your content. So if you create Reels, your other Instagram content should get greater visibility as well. Now because Reels do tend to have a more polished aesthetic than the more raw TikTok videos, you can lean into that if your brand also has a more polished style. So while TikTokers may reject overly produced videos, Reels consumers may welcome it. Take time to plan your video by defining your goal, structuring a story, and creating a call to action. You can even take it a step further and plan and storyboard every shot to make sure your message and call to action are clearly defined. And while Instagram's built-in video editor is fairly basic, you do have a world of other editing apps that were built for this. Apps like InShot, Splice, Animoto, or Video Show. Another big advantage of Instagram Reels is that it's easy to use. You've got the entire Instagram ecosystem behind you. That is, Reels isn't alone. It's part of a much larger machine that has many touchpoints where your audience can find your content. Reels videos not only appear in the Reels tab, they can also be featured within the Explore page, which is sort of like Instagram's version of TikTok's For You page, where the content is algorithmically personalized for each user. And one neat thing about the Explore page is that it contains more than just Reels. It also houses photos, Instagram feed videos, ads, and more. It's basically a marketplace of media that uses machine learning to know what each user wants. More than half of Instagram creators rely on it for discovery, so it's a great place for brands to organically show up and get discovered by people that don't already follow them. So where else can Reels videos appear? Well, you can post Reels to your own personal feed, and you can also share them to Instagram Stories, where the content can be highly visible for 24 hours before disappearing. And then, of course, Instagram is the only place where you can post Reels videos. Instagram is owned by Facebook, and Reels content is now embedded right in users' Facebook feeds. So there's a lot of touchpoints where your Reels videos can reach your target audience in different ways. And remember, just make sure to dial in all those social media best practices in creating your Reels content. Speak clearly to your audience's problem or need. Create content that is educational, entertaining, and inspiring. Package those bite-sized tips and hacks. Tell your brand story in an inspiring way. Show the behind-the-scenes content of your brand. Make sure you have that strong hook. Engage with trends. Collaborate with others in your niche. And then subtly slip in that value add. Again, it often takes trial and error to see what works.

Now what we're going to do is take a look at the footage that we've shot so far. So ideally up until this point, you've basically shot some sort of talking scene, whether or not that is you walking and talking, talking to the laptop, talking with the selfie video, talking to a DSLR or mirrorless camera. There's some type of dialogue or voiceover or something of some kind that we can basically create a shot list for and block out or yeah, basically create a list of cutaway shots to add on top of that footage. So what we're going to be talking about is reviewing and improving your footage. So as you can see here, I have all my before and after shots. You can see the improvements in the stylizing, in the coloring, in the lighting, in the depth, in the settings, all of these different attributes that we've talking about so far. And now this is where a lot of people can call their videos done, right? But we're going to take it a step further and introduce what's called B-roll or cutaway simply put, it's just extra, an extra layer of footage on top of what you've already shot that further explains what's going on in your video. So let's dive into that further.",

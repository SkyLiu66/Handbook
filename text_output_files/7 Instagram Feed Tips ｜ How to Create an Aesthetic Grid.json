First of all, let's talk about why do you actually need a good-looking Instagram feed. A beautiful and meaningful Instagram feed is definitely a great and powerful marketing tool. It helps personal blogs and creators to share their vision with the right audience, as well as it helps to create a community. And it's not only good for personal brands, but it also helps e-commerce brands and businesses to sell their services, to sell their products by creating a right emotional connection with potential customers and by translating the right values. Also, having a visually appealing feed can help you to gain more followers and increase engagement. I have been blogging on Instagram for many years now, and I am constantly creating visuals both for my Instagram accounts and also for other Instagram accounts and for different brands, because I also work as a visual designer. So I will be really happy to share with you my knowledge and experience, tips and tricks on how you can create an aesthetic, beautiful, harmonious Instagram feed that will work for your needs. Number one is all about topics and meanings on your Instagram. Remember, you need to be able to see what your Instagram feed and on your account itself. It's one of the most important points in social media and especially on Instagram. Remember what your account is actually about. What meanings do you carry to your audience? What information do you want to provide to existing and to potential audience? There is a really easy and nice trick that you can use to check if it's easily readable and understandable to others what your account is about. First of all, you need to answer this question. Who are you? Where do you live? Where do you work? Do you provide any services? If yes, what kind of services do you provide? Do you sell something? If so, what do you sell? What style do you have? And then after answering all these questions to yourself, you can ask your friends and you can ask just random independent people what your account is about. What first comes to their mind when they see your feed, when they see your Instagram account? What they can say about it? And then you can just compare your answers and answers of these people. And then you can understand if these answers will be matching, then it's great. You are doing a good job and everything is understandable and readable. But if these answers will not match and if people are answering some random things, not exactly what you wanted to convey from your account, then you need to work on your feed more in-depth. To have a beautiful Instagram feed. You need to have a beautiful Instagram feed. You need to define the style and define the vibe of account. Defining the style for your Instagram feed is crucial because it will set a tone for your content and it will create a more cohesive look that will attract and retain new followers. And when thinking about your vibe, consider the emotions and moods that you want your followers to feel when they view your content. Do you want to inspire your audience? Do you want to make them laugh? Do you want to evoke a sense of calmness and serenity? It's essential to write down a few adjectives that capture the vibe that you want to establish for your feed. For example, if you want a fun and playful vibe, you might write down adjectives like bright, colorful, cheerful. You may write down adjectives like calm, minimalist, simple, monochrome, peaceful. And once you have a clear idea of what kind of vibe you want to create, you can start writing down adjectives that capture the vibe that you want to establish for your feed. You can also write down adjectives that capture the vibe that you want to convey. It's much easier to create this type of content that will align with this aesthetic. Right now, I would describe my own Instagram feed as a firm, minimalist aesthetic with a neutral color palette. And third point is of course about color palette. It's very important to take into account the color palette of the feed. As you may know, each color has certain meanings and associations, and using the right colors, you can either emphasize the values of your style and content or your personal brand, or you can just carry the wrong and inappropriate associations. And the right colors can also attract the right target audience and customers. For example, if you're using blue color in your feed and in your design, this color often associated with trust and intelligence, so if you want to convey a sense of professionalism and reliability, you can use blue color. And if you want to create a more professional look, you can use a more professional look. And if you want to create a more professional look, you can use a more professional look. You can use the shades of blue in your feed, and this could be a good choice. And for example, pink color is often associated with femininity, with romance, with some kind of sweetness. So if your content is geared towards a female audience, you can use shades of pink. Pink color is often associated with the growth, with nature, with wellness, with health, with self-care. So if your content is related to this kind of topics, you can use more shades of green. So if you're using shades of green, you can use shades of blue in your feed, and this is probably the most popular choice. And also similar to接下來, you can use shades of green to show this and to highlight your topics to your audience. Black and white color palette could be a good choice if you want to convey a sense of sophistication, and timelessness, and simplicity, and if you want to create a minimalistic classical monochrome look for your feed, this will be a great choice for you. It is important to remember that different meanings and associations of colors can vary depending on cultural and even personal wing. So you can have one of these different colors that you like and you can apply them in your feed. interpretations so when choosing a color palette for your feed make sure to consider your target audience talking about colors first of all you need to use the basics you can select different shades for your profile from white gray and black and beige and then strike a balance between accent and primary colors which could be more bright colors like red blue green pink and you can mix them together and talking about the basic colors which are white beige or gray here you need to decide if you want more more cold or warm look and if you want more cold you can use more of gray shades if you want more warm instagram feed you can use more of beige brown shades and if you want to use really bright popping to the eye colors they really can catch the attention of the viewer but i think it's really important to use that them right and use them more like accents then it will look more balanced and more harmonious in the feed maybe you already know but there are several basic color combinations that always look good and harmonious and these color combinations are basically used everywhere in art and movies and design in everything visual for example it is a monochrome color scheme it is a palette that involves using different shades of a single color and this is my favorite color palette for me and i'm going to show you how to use it in this video i usually prefer to work more with earth toned colors like brown green beige and i really love to use for example just one beige color and different shades of it another color scheme could be a triangular one it is a color palette that involves using three colors that are equivalent from each other on the color wheel for example you could choose yellow blue and red to create a bold and vibrant feed another color combination is complementary is very popular one especially in movies and complementary color palette involves using two colors that are opposite to each other on the color wheel for example it could be blue and orange next let's talk about the harmony in the feed i think this is the most crucial and the most important point if you want to achieve a beautiful aesthetic instagram feed the harmony in the feed presents a unified and this cohesive look when everything looks good together while still showing a variety of different content of different photos and visual elements you still can have this cohesive look and everything looks as a whole together so the goal here is not to to edit every photo in the same style or in the same way but more to create like a collage of different photos that are edited differently that look differently but still they look together good but still they look good together and i think this is a very important tool when i think aboutizi show you something i had my room is pretty similar you can see if you are they also but they are smooth and all those lines are also smooth where if you have your frame and fronts that are not the same usually with the difference of color on the record they always look a little эфф coaches the attention of people. And there are a lot of ways to achieve this. You can use different low contrast photos, for example, or you can use minimal backgrounds. You can use photos with just few details to add this space and air to the feed. You can also include photos of the sky, of nature, of beach, something minimalistic. Another idea which you can use, which I really love, is to use templates, graphics, and designs. And I think they can be used everywhere. I think brands can use them in a great way to present their values. I think all personal blogs can use them to show what they like and just to share some kind of useful information. And I think that coaches, of course, can use them to show their services. It's really, really useful for anyone. And it's not only useful, it's just beautiful because it creates this... kind of variety of content in your feed. And by this, you can achieve balance and harmony and achieve this kind of aesthetic feed. And of course, incorporating templates, graphics, and designs into your feed can help break up the visual space and just, as I said, add some variety of the content. You can, for example, use graphics and add your favorite quotes. As you may know, I work not only as a blogger, but I also work as a visual digital designer. And I think it's really, really useful to have this kind of variety of content in your feed. And I think it's really, really useful to have this kind of variety of content in your and I create those digital templates that I am selling. And all the links you can find in the description below. You can purchase my templates if you want to, or you can just visit my website to get some inspiration with these graphics, or maybe you want to create them by yourself. Next thing I would like to discuss with you, which will help you to achieve aesthetic feed, is variety of content in the feed. Graphics and templates are the perfect solution for adding more content variety to the feed. And I think it's really, really useful to have this kind of feet as I already said but also of course the versatility of the photos itself can make harmony within the feet. For example last photo was selfie it's nicer I think to use something else with a wider perspective either it can be nature or it can be a full body look or something like interior or details so then you can combine all these photos as a collage and you will have a variety of content within the feet so try not to repeat perspectives in the photos one by one in a row. But of course sometimes different content creators and influencers break all the",

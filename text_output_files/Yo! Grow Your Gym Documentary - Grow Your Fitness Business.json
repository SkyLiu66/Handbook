    "data": " I'm Luca Josefara, the co-founder of Yo Grow Your Gym. If you're a frustrated and struggling gym owner, this is the most important film that you'll watch all year. You go from showing up to work one day and having a full client list to sitting at home. Around 14,000 gyms that have closed. You don't know what's next. The last two years have been the most challenging ever. A third of the industry wiped out. I had a child on the way. I had a big lease payment. I have a team, actually a big team. Responsibilities. You don't really know which direction to go. We had a four-month shutdown. A lot of times not knowing what's going to happen the next month. Two months, three months, being marketed against. It didn't seem like there was honestly any help around me. Telling us that we're not essential. It's the most essential industry there is. We need an army. We need a force. We need a force. They're actually the ones that called me up saying, hey, can you do some online training? Adapt the right way. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. And stand out. Paying shares, paying divide is what they always say. So we kind of moved through it like... Now in the next minutes, we're going to show you a new age of fitness business. A new breed of business owner that's taking and scaling their business to the next level. Not shutting down gyms, not making less money, not being afraid of how they're going to pay their next mortgage or rent or pay their rent. Or put food on the table for their families. If you're looking to scale and improve your business and be fulfilled, making the money that you deserve, having a freedom and a security. Actually, since COVID happened, I doubled my business, almost tripled my business. Build sustainability, finances, profits, teams. Right now is a massive opportunity. Make sure you take a notebook, a pen. Let's begin now. 291 years later, 216 films were filmed. So if right now you're in a space where you have anxiety but your anxiety is around the future. Man, I love doing this. Can I make enough? Right? my family to build wealth like can i retire the answer to that is yes yes this was crazy i know you've heard all this bullshit before you've heard all of it at the end of the day your vision means nothing without action we're not here to to fluff each other up that's the truth and some hard to swallow pills he's not always going to tell you what you want to hear like what decisions are you making right now because maybe there's a lot of fear involved in scarcity hey let's go on this vacation with the family for a week can't we what happens to the bank like can we do that oh man i'm gonna pull back because you're not willing to put yourself out there and we understand that we were tested we were challenged the struggle becomes like hey how do i do all this we all have different ideas of what our dream lives are but i can guarantee you one thing if you're buried inside of your business right now like i was like he was then a dream life sounds like this you ready for it you, the ability to go do what you want when you want with who you want and know that your business is actually churning money and results the next step is clear you either want help or you don't and if you want help continue watching because we're going to unlock some major keys but you can just take away from this video even if you decide not to work with us coaches need to have coaches and you got to have people speaking into your life you got to find rooms where you're not the smartest person in the room you got to soak all that in a usual experience well a lot of my friends a lot of my colleagues have been losing clients losing work i've been so full that i've had to turn people away kind of crazy in March i had 43 clients i now have 78 i can feel myself catching momentum i got some collaborations that are going to happen i actually opened up my spot and they were pushing me to open up that spot Covid 2.0 whatever it is bring it i'm at the point where i actually have a two month waiting list so my name is dan brown i'm a strength and conditioning coach becky i'm the owner of physio movement and performance i'm michael briggs owner of bona fide boxing and kickboxing my name is jordan harter luca and steve have just been phenomenal luca's helped me more than just through covid luca's actually helped me so much in life i like that focus that uh steve and luca have focused on you get your mind right get your emotions right get your relationships right that actually helped me elevate to the next level got me a lot more confidence just being in the group so when everyone was shutting down you know actually opened my own facilities all the strategies all that stuff that's the hardware the software you know has to be right and what's up here what's in here and how do we solidify that it gave me hope the travel area it wasn't for me doing coaching with steve and luca like i would have completely fallen apart at the time i feel like he cared more about me than i did for him i feel like he cared more about me than i did for him i feel like he cared more about my success than i cared about my success which actually started to give me more confidence growing my business in my relationships in life it's been pretty significant of a change in my revenue stream and how many people i've been able to impact so i'll have more time to spend with family and friends all because i made the decision to show up and that's all you got to do sometimes as like corny as it sounds man luca's changed my whole life and i i own everything it's crazy but um you know i'm happy that we put this on even during circumstances what do you want to do if you had more time what would you do if you had more money what would you do if every morning you could get up and be excited about your business what decisions would you make if you were coming from a place of power and abundance and not scarcity that is the success to be able to make decisions out of power building the business in the way you have enough money in the bank and your business is running without you and you can fill in the blanks with whatever it is that individual success looks like for you this is in some program we're going to teach you guys how to do underhanded shit out of integrity no fucking way every other program offers what get more clients right now get more clients right now get more clients right now if you're on the titanic would you want to load more people on the fucking boat we went through the nightmares of getting more leads three months later going whoa whoa what is going on why is our revenue down what about leadership what about team building putting the right people in the right places and that's what builds the whole business it's not that simple we want to take you and find those bottlenecks and help you step by step through those bottlenecks so that you build a legitimate business not just have a better lead generation system we're going to help you build a better business and so what's different is that we address every aspect of it me and steve have coached business coaches and owners for over eight years now we helped hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of coaches found new revenue streams created new opportunities created a better stronger foundation than ever because of using the systems the resources the coaching and accountability in this program and there's not something in the ether like we're talking about real numbers our mission is to impact 10 000 coaches and gym owners in the next five years through our program and right now is a massive opportunity less coaches and more people to help so it's a supply and demand why why do you not step into that role of becoming the coach the gym in your area if you think about this as an investment which your business is an investment in your future it's an investment in your family's lives you invest in the time where most other business owners where most other people are too afraid to what bet on themselves anytime you see a dive there's going to be an opportunity and this is the opportunity for you the people that are willing to bet on themselves never lose we learn you've seen evidence proof and stories of successful clients and how they built their business built their freedom security they've gone on the road and they're making a difference in their lives and their lives and there's a lot of people who are willing to give up their money and they're going to go on their revenue now if you're still watching i can imagine you're frustrated angry because you are not there yet so if you're feeling that if you're resonating with this make sure you click the button below and let's get started so after owning a gym now for for 15 years on two continents the one that we started in slovenia the big round fitness and performance then starting here from scratch from a garage gym to a little bit of a bigger space to now owning the building that we're sitting in in big round in seattle and rent in seattle one of the gyms that that i started i started in the recession 2008 which was a very challenging time and yet this was even more so challenging the most difficult parts of the pandemic as a gym owner for me personally was the uncertainty and the unknown of just having to shut down we had a four month shutdown and making the decision to continue to pay our staff and our team essentially close to their normal salaries giving that security my team is my family i also have to take care of my my blood family that will keep me up at night legitimately keep me up at night thinking through how to do this i want to earn what i'm worth i want to make money i want to make the best possible life for my family adaptability is is a critical component of business in general but in times like this it's do or die when you look at all of this right and at the same time there has been opportunities online one of the things that me and steve have done very well is always learning always adapting and also build these mindsets and these skill sets that in times like this allow us to i would say get out of the hurricane in your mind make decisions on what is the right thing to do and that's what we're doing right now and that's what we've done we shifted to a completely online model virtual streaming model smoothly online programming coaching and streaming workouts so that not only you're like i said your gym and your business can survive but it can thrive and you can feed your team you can feed your family you can continue to impact the community and your clients so that when the doors open there was a flood of clients and i believe that there is the biggest opportunity there's ever been if you're doing the right things and when i say this the reason that we started the yoga gym mentorship was because we need army more people that are great keep that culture where it is because we love it right we were drawn to this by purpose what we teach what we coach what we keep people accountable on is standing out building that authority building that celebrity building that expert status the people that couldn't stand out unfortunately whether we're in the gym or we're in the gym we're in the gym we're in the gym we're in the gym we're in the gym we're in the gym we're in the gym we're in the gym we're in the gym we're

we're going to change some stuff up and we're going to rattle some things and bring the greatest value that we've ever brought every single time i put my ass on the line invested got a coach was part of community i grew and the reason i am here today is because of that so if you know if you know in your heart that it's time you don't want to lose that time you don't want to lose that time want to

How kids get course, which we sold for $1,000 on its own at the beginning of this year and helped 54 people launch an online component to their fitness business with success.

We give you access to the Fitness Business Mixtape, the product that started it all. You get access to the packed Syndicate magazine, but you also get access to 350 more. Extra workouts done for you by Luca himself. And finally, the icing on the cake. Inside the membership site, there's a tab that's called Pay For Your Coaching, where every single month, Luca and I will drop a strategy that will more than pay for your monthly investment inside of the Yo Grow Your Gym Mastermind. For the cost of one member a month, you get access to all of this and more. When you finish this program...

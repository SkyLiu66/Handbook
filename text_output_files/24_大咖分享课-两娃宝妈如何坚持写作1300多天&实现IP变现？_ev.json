Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Because they are artists, they have a need to improve. So they must maintain their condition. Also, like athletes, why can Silo, for so many years, maintain his body, and ask himself to eat very strictly, and keep exercising? It's also because he is an athlete. He wants to keep his professional career at the top. He must have to maintain such a state of training. This is what I want to say. I want to be able to keep doing something. Because I am a mother, I can keep doing this. Some people may say, why do I see some mothers who are not like this? This is very important. We can always choose to see ourselves. We can always choose to have more choices. This reminds me of why I started writing to train myself through writing. It's because when I first became a mother, I was really scared. In the eyes of everyone, to become a mother is to be unable to make money. Or to be able to escape from society. In many people's eyes, to become a mother is a role like this. I saw it that way at the time. So because I didn't have a choice, writing was my way out. Because in my opinion, including until now, I always think that reading and writing are the highest cost for every ordinary person. The most effective way to grow. When you can do these two things to the extreme, it will change your life. Because I saw it with my own eyes, many people through reading and writing achieved the degree of change in life. I can share this with you later. At that time, I thought I had no choice. Writing was my only choice at that time. Because after you became a mother, especially two years before the child, you have less opportunities to go to class outside. You have less opportunities to be a teacher. You have less opportunities to go to class outside. You can only stay with your child more. Writing is something I can do anytime, anywhere. I can start it. So at that time, I chose to write because it was my only choice. I didn't have a choice at that time. So I had to do it. And also, when I was doing this, after having a child, when you have a responsibility, you have to do it. You have to do it. You have to do it. You have to do it. I'm a child. You may be a leader of a team. Or you may be a father. Or you have a role. Sometimes, you will find that when you have a responsibility, your state of doing something is completely different. Just like I started to awaken myself after having a child. I don't know if you have experienced such a stage. At some point, you feel like you have become an adult. Have you ever had such a moment? What was the moment like? I started to think that I was a mother. I realized that I had become an adult. I wanted to be a role model for my child. How should I live my life? Because in my mindset, I always think that a good mother is not about telling you what to do every day, but about what kind of state I live in. You see me living in this state, so she will automatically imitate me. I also always think that we don't influence others with ideas, but with actions. So if I want to live my life, I have to do it first. Writing is the tool that I used to train myself. So when I was writing, I felt that everyone could feel a story. There is a story that when you are facing difficulties, we are now facing difficulties. The first reaction is that this problem is so difficult. Forget it. Or you may be updating your book. When updating your book, you will feel that today I don't have a topic to choose from. Or today I don't know what to post. Or today I am in a bad mood. Or so on. Or today, when there are various problems, you may feel that I will not do this thing. But if you are a character, and this character, for example, I am a mother, and I am walking on the road, suddenly, there is a wall in front of me. Then this wall, I may feel that it blocks me. I won't go there, right? But if there is a child crying and shouting at the other side of the wall, Mom, mom, mom, help me, I am here. At this time, when I hear my child crying, I don't care what the wall in front of me is. I don't care how big the problem is. I only care how to save my child. At this time, our attention is no longer on what is in front of us, but on how to achieve my goal. This is what I want to say. When you become someone, you have the ability to achieve the goal you want. This is why after I became a mother, the role of mother did not restrict me. Instead, I became a better me. I have always told my students that there is no such thing as a limit. Because I have a lot of friends around me. They may be employees in the factory, or maybe senior officials in the country. They often say something like I am in a certain environment, so I can't do anything. But I also see some people because they are in this environment, including myself. I am in this environment. I am in such a difficult situation. I can still choose to see what I can do. I can create. There is no such thing as a limit to what we can create. Instead, we can create something. This is what I want to share with you. When you go from top to bottom, there is a model in MLP called the model of understanding layers. When you go from identity to belief in value to ability to act, when you determine who you are, naturally, you will be triggered what you want to do. But if you do it the other way around, you will be too slow. It's like climbing a mountain. Climbing up is very tiring. But when you go from top to bottom, you will be more and more relaxed. I always encourage everyone to do one thing. It is to confirm what kind of person you want to be. Then what kind of thing you will do. Just like you are a little red book blogger. Then you have to do what little red book bloggers should do. That is to say, you have to do what little red book bloggers should do. What you do is what you are supposed to do. That is to write a diary every day. Many people think that I have to have some ability to do something. Actually, no. You have to do this first to have this ability. Just like my husband. He is very good at English. He didn't study abroad. But his English is good. No one else thought he studied abroad. You might think he went there because his English is good. Now he is not. But it is because he keeps practicing. After he keeps practicing, he can do what he is doing now. He is not good at English at the beginning. But he is getting better and better after he practices. I have always encouraged people like us to say I want to have money to live a good life. But it is not. It is what kind of life you want to live. You have to let yourself have the resources to do what you can. Let yourself be in this state of life. Then keep working hard. Let yourself be in this state of life. For example, Li Xinping is a queen of literature and history. What he is most good at is writing and translation. But before that, he has actually experienced not being seen by others. He is very stupid. But at that time, he really wanted to go to Greece. So he gained courage and took a credit card. He went to Greece. After that, he kept thinking how to pay back the money. So he went to Greece and wrote a post. At that time, the post was posted on the Internet. Then the Internet was seen by the publishing house. The publishing house invited him to publish a book. After he finished writing the book, he not only earned the money from Greece, but also started to become a writer. Many times, we don't wait until you have it. You are OK. You start something. Instead, you let yourself be in this state. You will have the life you want. This is what I want to share with you. Otherwise, like now, we start to do the training of writing a book. Actually, I believe everyone wants to become a book publisher. But if you have already become, in fact, in this state, you are already a book publisher. If you don't send a note, it will be like you opened a shop. But if you don't open the door every day, you will be a book publisher. So, if you don't open the door every day, you will feel that you are not reliable. Do you know? Reliable is the most important quality that others are willing to pay for you. Stability is one of the reliable standards. Are you sticking to it? Have you persisted to do this thing? This is the first point I want to share with you. That is, it's not what you do that you will become a person. It's what kind of person you become first and then you can do something. Now, since you are a book publisher, we hope you can persist to send notes. Don't worry about your position. We didn't define your position at the beginning. As I remember, Luo Jia mentioned that before he made the account of this domestic machine, he had already made several accounts and tested them constantly. Then, he managed to run through one. Including myself, I have been doing writing and writing for three or four years. But before that, I was an office worker. When I was an office worker, I always thought I would love the office for my whole life. As a result, I loved it for three years and then I became a office worker. So, don't think you can find your position by yourself. You should start from the beginning. After you start, you will have your position. And don't think you can be popular at once. It may just take a long process. Later, I will share the story of a friend of mine for ten years. What did the ten-year change bring him? Because I'm actually not good at making quick money. If you want to listen to the way I make quick money, this is not for you. Because I always make slow money and make more and more money. I was not a person who would insist. I used to do things with Luo Jia. I asked him why so many people are popular. We were writing public numbers at that time. Now, you guys are making videos for the Red Book. In the past, in 2016, we were writing public numbers. I saw people around me getting more and more popular. Many people were asking me if I wanted to report a writing class. I think they all wrote very well. At that time, Luo Jia replied to me. I still remember it very deeply. He said to me, he said, you just need to not be on the Internet for three days or two days, you will be popular. At that time, this sentence was like a needle in my heart. Because of this sentence, it touched me very much. I saw one thing. Those who are popular are not because they write well. It's because they persisted in the Internet. This is what makes me from 2016 to now, I have always seen those who can live around me. What is the characteristic that they all have? Maybe it is also what everyone cares about. What is the core of transformation? The core of transformation is the value of continuous supply. That is, we have always said how do you become an IP? How do you go out of the circle? The most important point is that you provide value to others. But in my opinion, the value of supply is far from enough. You have to provide value to others. What is the value of continuous supply? It's not that you do this thing for one year, or do this thing for two years. It's that you do this thing for three or five years. This is called continuous supply. Many people will think that I seem to be very good so that I can share it. I seem to be ready so that I can start. In fact, if you really observe those who live on the Internet, they are not very good. They are just ordinary people who show their growth and share their thoughts. You don't even need to have experience. You don't even need to have the ability. You just share your current life. There will be a lot of attention. But the premise is that you continue to share it. You keep letting others see you. This is very important. So, I really want to share this with one of my teachers. He is doing something for ten years. Then, seven years ago, he was silent. But you can't say he was silent. There are certain people who know him. But he is only known in the professional field. But seven years ago, it was like he was invisible outside the circle. Then, three years later, seven years later, he was living in a small room of 800 square meters and started his business. Then, he can do it for ten years. In Guangzhou and Shenzhen, these two cities are all established. You should know what I mean by established. Then, he can do his business to the tens of millions of cash. The tens of millions of such projects are based on these words. This sentence is also what he often shared with me. Three years of meeting, five years of meeting, seven years of love and ten years of friendship. These are the three things that we should remember. The first thing is to keep providing value. This is not about doing this thing for one or two days. But it's about doing this thing for a long time. When you know that you do this thing for a long time, will you care about your starting point or whether you did it well or not? It's okay. Because we have time to do this thing for a long time. When you do this thing with persistence, you will achieve something different. I couldn't do it before. Why can I do it now? The big reason is because I started to write because I was taught by my teacher. So, when I started writing five years ago, four years ago, we had one-on-one counseling. And until now, I have been learning with my teacher how to do something in private. It involves a lot of content. I can't teach through pure theory. But tonight, I can share about three points with you. These three points are very important in my opinion. The first point is that actually, these words sound like correct nonsense. But if you can do it, it will turn into power rather than theory. The first point is to start doing it. So, I used to feel stressed when I was writing or writing or writing notes. But why can I do it better later? It's because I found that in writing, writing can be done at any time and anywhere. So, I found a rule on why writing can be held down. It's because it's easy. When we do something, we need to find the smallest action for ourselves. Find the smallest action for ourselves. I didn't do a PPT. Find the smallest action. What is the smallest action? For example, I'm recording a video now. Every time I record a video, I'll take my phone and record it directly. For example, my mouth-to-mouth video is recorded directly when I open my phone. I don't care if I'm wearing makeup or where I am. I don't care where I am and where my light is. I just take my phone and record it directly. Every time, I record a video for one minute and then I do it persistently. If we want to adjust the equipment, do a lot of things, and adjust a lot of things, this is hard. What is the smallest action? Is it that we can record it directly with our phone? This is the smallest action. When we do anything, we can do one thing which is to find the smallest action. Now, you can think about what is the smallest action when you are not confident and motivated. When you are not confident and motivated, you can find the smallest action. The second one is to do effectively. When you start doing it, this action will make you feel that doing this action will bring positive feedback. When you have positive feedback, when you do this, you will feel that doing this is valuable because you can see the results and you can see that you are doing something effectively. If you keep doing something that is not effective, you may not have any response or traffic for a long time and it is difficult to do this. But if you do this for a long time with 10 units, you will see less bottlenecks in the process. But if you keep doing this, you will see the results and you will be able to do it better. So, I think doing this is very important because I am not the only one doing this. When I was doing this, there was a coach who would continuously give me feedback on how to do it so that it would be effective. If you cannot do this on your own, you can find someone with results to help you. Effective feedback is very important. And then, in this process, there is a group of people who grow with you. For example, in the small book circle, it is like this. In this training camp, it is actually equivalent to finding a teacher and finding a circle to help yourself do this with feedback. If you are alone, let's say you do not have an environment, you may give up when you are in trouble. But if you have a teacher and a partner, it is easier to do something under the support and encouragement. The last one is to do it continuously. To do it continuously means to find a rule to do something. What is the rule of the rhythm of what you do? For example, in our writing service, we write 10,000 words every day in our writing training. That is because I am doing this every day. So once I stop doing it, I will be very uncomfortable because I do it every day. This is a rule to be followed. This is something my body has formed the habit of doing something. It is the same for you to write a note. You have to find your own rule. Do not think that I am in a state today and I will do this. No. But you have to set a rule. Is it a week to update once or a month to update once or update every day? You set this rule and this rhythm down and then you will do this thing. When you repeat a rhythm all the time, there will be a situation where you don't want to do it because you have developed this rhythm like eating. You will be used to doing it. We really do one thing and do it to the end is not by insistence and not by always allowing you to do something but by the habit and inner force to drive you to do this thing so that you can continue to do it. So we often say that stability is the highest characteristic of a master. The high-level characteristic is that you can do it when you are in a bad state and when you are in a good state you can do it better. Often people tell me that I want to do something at will and I want to do it according to myself. Many people say that I want to do it at will and I want to follow my heart. So in my opinion to really follow my heart is not to say that I am in a bad mood today and I won't do something. No. It is that when I am in a good state I can do it and I can do it when I am in a good state. This is called following my heart. Because the true heart wants you to do something then you can do what you should do at the moment. So this is what I want to share with you. How to insist on doing something is to start doing it and then find the smallest action. To do something effectively you need someone to give you feedback. To continue doing it is to find the right rhythm and pattern. This is what I want to say. So finally I want to talk about everyone's special interest in the world and the world and the world and the world beforehand. But anyway what is interesting was theiesen The Land of Reason The long-term For the 020 shown To connect a completely automatic you have a practical 180 aspect key and can improve any love you energy I was able to do things right. I will look back and summarize what I did right in my growth process. The first point is to develop on the survival line. For example, I was working in an office for a long time. But I know that the office product cannot support my second-tier development. It won't make me make more money. It will make me feel more stable. If I put all my energy into the office, I won't be able to study new things and develop new skills. What I did at that time was not to earn small money in a hurry, but to put time on long-term development. So I cut off the office. I didn't go to the office anymore. I didn't invest in the office. I gave up short-term benefits and did long-term valuable things. Why do you have to develop on the survival line? If you can't even solve survival now, you must satisfy your survival first. You can do whatever you want to do. But if you have passed the survival period and are already well, and you are still doing well, it is difficult for you to develop. Many people know AI, know small books, know Douyin, know video calls. They don't have time to study these. They just don't want to visit. They don't want to waste time to learn. They don't want to waste time to try things. But the more you spend time doing these things, the less room for you to grow in the future. This is what I especially want to share with you. Before you become popular, you must have a good class. On the survival line, you must desire development. If you are going to do things to seek development, you will have development in the future. If you keep doing survival, you will only stay in the survival stage. When I was working in the office, the price of the class was 99 yuan. But after I cut down on the office and focused on writing and writing, my current class price can go up to 50,000 yuan. And our class price will keep rising. So I really encourage everyone to see what stage you are in. Are you on the survival line? Then you must do development. Like Xiao Hong said, she must be a red-light. Like AI, she must be a development trend. Then do we spend one or two hours every day to set our own space for future growth? And the second one is that I am doing the right thing. I am doing high class class price. Why choose to do high class class price? Because the first class price is very important. The measurement standard is that if you have traffic in the apartment, what is the apartment? For example, like Xiao Hong Shu, Douyin, etc. You have traffic. You are a million-signature. You have more than a hundred thousand fans who pay attention to you. This is called apartment traffic. When you have apartment traffic, for example, you pay 100 yuan for a course, there may be thousands of people who buy it. Then the total income will be higher. But if I do it privately, like me, I will share it on WeChat, in the circle of friends, or in the public account. Then the people I do is the traffic of private domain. My main customer is from private domain. It is very difficult for me to find 100 people. But if I focus on doing high class class price, I want to make a product of 10,000 yuan. Suppose I make a product of 10,000 yuan. I find a person to buy it. It is relatively. It is very easy to find 100 people to buy a product of 100 yuan. Can you understand what I mean? It is much easier to find a person to buy my product at a high price than to find 100 people. Many people think it is difficult to do high class price. But it is not. It is more difficult to find more people. But if you are self-employed, it is better to do high class price. But if you are in an apartment, you actually do low class price. Then the number of people will increase. The total amount will increase. If you say I am not able to buy it, or no one buys it, what should I do? Then don't sell it first. Do you know? Don't sell it first. You just mark the price. But if you don't sell it, if no one buys it, then you don't lower the price. Just keep marking the price. And then in the process, you will continue to cultivate yourself. Let your ability to be able to be exposed to others. They will want to pay you. I have an ability. Every time I meet people in the line, they will say to me at the end, I want to buy your class. When your ability reaches a certain extent, you will have to let others pay you. This requires you to cultivate. And when you are cultivating, one thing you must do is to continue to provide value to others. If you just do it yourself, and others don't know how good you are, they can't pay you. And you are improving yourself. You must continue to share value. You may be able to do live broadcasts, and then work number, update your circle of friends, or update your small red brush, etc. You are continuously providing value to others. You can continue to let others see that you have the ability to give them knowledge. So while you are doing high-class price, you must be able to let others see your ability. This is very important. This is what I have on this IP. This is the second method of transformation. The third one is very important. This is my whole logic. This is the most important factor that allows my product to continue to operate. I am doing this fee-to-pay business. We are doing business to see how many orders are sold today. Because what we do, what I have been doing, is long-term business. What is long-term business? My client will not only buy this year, but will continue to buy next year. And I have a product that he will buy. I have a second product that he will also buy. In other words, no matter what I sell, he will buy it. Or after this service is over, he will continue to buy it. I am doing fee-to-pay business. Fee-to-pay business comes from your customers' high level of trust and high-level of obsession with you. This will come from one thing, which is that you are extremely rich. Your rich things, customers agree with it very much. That's why he keeps on paying. Why are we afraid of knowledge expenditure or many products? Because after you buy, you will feel that you are a leech. You will find that in the knowledge expenditure, you do not have many classes. You will continue to buy after you buy once. I don't know if you will be like this. But I mostly buy classes outside. I basically don't buy the second time. I may even finish this class. I may finish listening. I even may not finish listening. I put it aside. But what we do is not. What we do is the business of market share. What we do is that customers can keep buying. Keep buying. This difficulty is very high. But once your goal is to do the business of fee rate, the logic of business and the way you do things will be completely different. You have to make urgent payments. This is what I want to share with you. How I transform and talk to you to develop on the survival line. I have about three points in my growth. But you said there are actually a lot of things behind it that can be disassembled. But today I will talk to you about three points. I want to talk about three points. First, I want to say that I want to develop on the survival line. And I want to be loyal to the red power. And finally, I have to do the business of fee rate. So if you listen to me today, I would like to say to you that what you insist on doing is more important than what you do. It's the quality ability developed in the process of doing something that is more important than what you do. You finish something, you make something happen, you continue to do something, and you practice it in this process. What is more important than what you do is more important. Can you understand this? So finally, that's all for today. I will leave some time to communicate with you later. And then I prepared a benefit for you. If you are interested in fishing, you can go to our 7-day membership. You can experience a little bit what is the tool that has been helping me to practice. And I will leave 10 minutes to communicate with you. If there is any problem, I will reply in the comments area. Because I haven't done this kind of live for a long time. We all do one-to-one service more. Any questions? I will leave the link in the description box. If you have any questions, please contact me. Thank you. See you. See you. Bye. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. What do you mean by my thought process? 这个提到的可能都是在编辑里思路是什么意思呢? 哦,可能都在编辑里思路,就是提问是吗? 好的,好的。 大家也可以加我微信跟我交流, 然后给大家准备的份礼物, 如果是我们社群的小伙伴的话, 加了我之后我会给你送一本书。 哦,谢谢。 我会给你们送出我的新书。 因为我跟洛佳认识的时间太长了, 就是特别认可的前辈。 对,我把他当前辈,虽然他比我小。 嗯。 一下子不知道怎么掉了。  写个一万字,写个一万字里一下思想。 I like your questions. I am a service provider. I am always doing the consultation when I am paying. So if you ask a good question, I will give you a valuable answer. It is more valuable than sharing it alone. I think it is more valuable than sharing it alone. It is more valuable than sharing it alone. As Jacka mentioned, this is a good point. You mentioned that you feel that something is right, but it will take some time to get the result. Do you have to stick to it? This is what I said on the screen. This is what I will answer. What you stick to is more important than what you do. Whether you do it or not, whether you give up on it, is not what you think after you start it. Before you start it, you just think about it. You are not sure if you want to do it. So in the process, you don't have to think about whether you want to do it or not. You spend more time on the internal account. Whether you want to do it or not. You finish it. The ability and quality developed by this thing is more important than what you do. You know, whether you do a small business, or a public account, it doesn't matter. The key is that you can stick to it. I had a friend a while ago. Recently, everyone says that there is no traffic on public accounts, right? But he is doing public accounts. How much does he do on public accounts? He has a new account. He has done 6000 posts in a month. And he has published 200,000 or 300,000 articles. This is what he did last month. What you do is not important. The important thing is that you stick to it. Even if you think the result is not obvious, it doesn't matter. Just like when I was writing a post, I wrote 10,000 words every day. No one knew what I wrote every day. I wrote 10,000 words every day. I wrote 10,000 words every day. I wrote 10,000 words every day. I don't write anything every day. I haven't been doing anything wrong. But I have been writing 10,000 words every day for three or four years. The things I did, the capabilities and qualities they brought me, including why my clients come to learn from me, it's because they see my persistence and these qualities in me. They want to be people like me. They think I live in the state that they want me to live in. So they come to me and become my clients. What you do is not important. It doesn't matter what you do. It's not about thinking about it during the process. It's about starting. You don't want to think about it. You just want to finish it. Sometimes you feel that doing something doesn't seem to have any result. Then you do something to give yourself a deadline. Don't think that doing something is to do it without any purpose. No, you give yourself 7 days, 1 month, half a year, 30 days. Before I do something, I set myself a deadline. For example, 30 days, 100 days. During this time, I can do it in a few days. If I do it after the deadline, I think it's good and I can continue. Then I will do it in a timely manner. I will do it efficiently and find the right time. For example, when I update my videos, I update them every day for 1 minute. After 30 days, I think that I need to do it to do my live broadcast, to do my writing, to do my friend circle. But if I do it all in the video, I will have some trouble. I will adjust and find a rule to do it. I will become like this. I write an article this year and I will write 100 articles. Then I will post a video this year and I will post 100 articles. I will set a deadline for myself. I don't say that I will do everything every day on one thing. I find my own rules. But don't imitate me to do this rule. Because I spent 3 years on writing articles. That's why I can do it. I can update 10 articles every month. I spent 3 years on this. So you don't have to do it step by step like me. Do this and that. But find the most important thing for you in this stage. For example, I will post a small article to you. This is the best stage in Hongli. Or the video is the best stage in Hongli. But the best time has passed. But now this stage is still the best stage. It's still the best stage. It's never outdated. Just like the public number I mentioned just now. You can still do it now. But you have to insist on doing it. Do it effectively. It will get better and better. Just keep doing one thing. This is very important. Keep doing it. It's good to set a time node for yourself. It's not that you don't want to do it for 10 years at the beginning. But set a time node for yourself first. Do this thing. I understand this too much. You stopped doing it for a while. Don't stop. Just keep doing it. As long as your direction is right, just keep doing it. Everyone will have times in this process when they can't hold on. But every time you want to stop, go forward a little bit. Go forward a little bit. You will... You will become different. You don't hold on because you are good at it. Just because you are good at it. You don't hold on because you are good at it. This is why I said I am a mother. That's why I can do one thing. But there are many people who are mothers. But they live on the other side of me. It depends on what you see, what you choose, and what you will do. Any more questions? Thank you for the question. Alright. All right. I am going to take a certain route. I am now in retirement. If you can ask this question, it means you have too many choices. It doesn't matter if you don't make this choice. No matter how many methods I give you, no matter how many things I give you, it's useless. Because you are too comfortable in this moment, too many choices. If you have no choice, you just do it. So why do a lot of people with very low starting points jump very high? But those with good conditions will slowly be pulled away from others because they are too comfortable. I don't know if I'm right, but every person I meet who asks me such a question is still a lot of... You are on the development line. Because you are on the development line, you don't have too much motivation to let yourself change and grow. I have a teacher. She used to be a very literary young woman. And then, she was very interested in making money. She didn't have any special desire to make money. And then, every day, she shared her life with her friends with a small amount of money. And then, she was in a state of poverty. Until one day, she inexplicably owed 2 million yuan. And then, from that day on, she became a person. She just wanted to make money. As long as she could help her business, she would... She would do it without hesitation. She would do it. And then, she paid off 2 million yuan in 2 years. And then, she became a person. I am the same. Before I became a mother, I was a Buddhist. But after I became a mother, I wanted to give my children a better role. And then, I had a bigger family responsibility. I would be different from many things. So, when I became более passive, I was anymore… Conce MIDI sein combinaang hayat, enabling me to dress up for my parents. To me, there was no real life experience between mom and dad. I liked being in the marriage department. I could see whether the life<|ja|> was going to change my life that way. 也不用焦虑,就是如果我们能够马上开始,当然是最好的。 但是如果你现在开始不了,也没关系。 因为你有你的花旗,生活会教会你做人。 就是我一直认为,生活会教会你做人,我觉得真的是这样子。 然后慢慢的,你就会成长,你会有自己的花旗开始的,所以没有关系。 为什么孩子有那么大力量? 对呀,这就是爱吧。 我觉得爱是有无穷无尽的力量的。 就是我们说,有两件事情力量是最大的,一个就是爱,另外一个就是恐惧。 当你被恐惧支配的时候,比如说,就比如说你可能是一个你今天起不来床,但是如果说你要去赶飞机。 那这个飞机如果赶不上,你就搭不了这个飞机,你会被这个恐惧支配。 那么哪怕你平时是熬夜熬到很晚,但是呢,那一天你要赶飞机,那天你也绝对不会让自己迟到。 就是人是会被恐惧给支配的。 但同时人也会被爱给推动了往前走。 就是如果说你特别想守护一个人,就比如说你可能欠债了,你特别不希望这个家人成为,自己成为这样的负担。 那你就会特别的想尽办法去赚更多的钱,给到去还掉钱,然后给家人更好的生活。 不仅是孩子,所有的爱都是。 就像我自己在做,我自己其实以前,我自己是一个孩子。 就像我跟乐嘉的关系一样,就是,我是一直很尊重很欣赏他的。 就是每次他找我干活的时候,其实我都,最早以前,他经常会给很多很多的机会给我。 然后我其实是不爱干活的一个人,我也不太喜欢去做事情。 反正我也不缺钱嘛,那我的状态也不错,那我为什么要去那么辛苦。 但是我就是很欣赏他呀,然后我也很认可他。 所以当他认可我的时候,我是特别愿意付出的。 我觉得这个就是,每个人都会有自己的那一份,想要去有的那份责任吧。 是的,要断了后路。 就是当你有后路的时候,你就太多选择,就没有办法往前。 为什么答疑的时候,人数比分享的时候还要多? 有问题吗? 没有问题的话,我们就下线了。 或者你们也可以来私下找我也可以。 开始去做就好了。 给自己一个。 这个就是我补充的点,就是什么呢? 就是其实我们都不缺能力的。 缺的是心力。 心力是什么? 心力就是,一个就是能量。 就是你做一件事情,你有没有能量? 你什么时候会有能量呢? 你身边有一个人,他做得很好。 他的起点可能跟你差不多。 但是你看到他越来越绽放,越来越绽放。 然后你看到他要做就做的那个状态,那个能量,就会吸引你。 你靠近他的时候呢,你也会觉得,哎,我是不是也能够做得像他那样。 你就会开始有那个能量。 或者是,我觉得榜样的力量是很重要的。 这也是为什么刚才讲,你要有效的去做一件事情的时候,你身边有朋友,有老师,有群体的时候,你做一件事情的状态绝不同。 因为你在这个圈子里面,大家都在行动,就会给你力量。 但如果说你身边的人全部都不动的,那你就会也跟着不动。 你在一个什么样的圈子,你就会活成什么样的一个状态的人。 但是人是环境的产物。 你要尽可能的让自己靠近你想要活出来的人的那一群的圈子里面是很重要的。 比如说你觉得自己没有决心,你觉得自己没有动力,你觉得自己不够坚持。 那你远离这样的一些人,去到那些坚持性动力的人。 就像为什么我们的圈子,就是我们语写圈子的四五年来,能够越来越坚持长期主义,越来越能够长期做一件事情。 就是因为这个圈子的氛围就是这样子。 你去看到别人做出成绩了,你会相信,啊,原来长期主义是有用的。 但是当你没有真正看到有人真的是做到的时候,你是不相信的。 而你为什么没有动力去改变这种,其实也是因为你心里面还不够相信。 就像我的老师,他到现在目前出了五本,六本书了吧。 但是呢,他的,然后他一直推着我去出书,我就觉得,啊,我出,我就会有个执念。 最开始有个执念想说,我要出书。 我的第一本书写得不好,如果写得不好,出书多难看呀。 然后就会在想,我要准备好了才出书。 然后他就会跟我说,你不是准备好了,你才去做这个事情。 但是你先入了这本书之后,你就会越来越好。 我当时不是很理解,可是我看到他出了六本书之后,我就更加理解了。 就你不要想着你第一本书,你就会好。 就像你不要想着你第一篇笔记就会好。 而是你不断的去发的这个过程当中,你会越来越好。 你写的书也会越来越好。 就是你前面写的书烂没关系。 但是抵不住你写的书越来越好啊。 你只要让自己越来越好,你前面有多烂都没有关系。 但前提是你先开始。 如果你没有开始的话,你根本不会越来越好。 就是人是环境的常。 我一定要让自己去到一个好的圈子里面来。 这个非常重要的。 这个确实就是这样。 你身边的人是什么样子的,你就会成为什么样子的人。 然后你会成为什么样子的人。 如果我们这个小红书的圈子每天都有人发, 他今天做到了他的笔记多少赞呀,然后他有多少粉丝呀, 然后去分享了自己的整个的这个成长过程。 你每天看就像看直播一样,就非常有动力。 像我们圈子就天天做这种事情。 你就会看到长期主义带来的改变真的是很不可思议的。 但前提是你先相信。 其实有时候是你先相信了你才活出这个状态。 不是你活出这个状态你才相信。 是你先相信才活出这个状态。 我非常的相信,相信这个词。 对呀,很多时候卖不开第一步,闭上眼睛卖出去就可以了。 其实不需要去想卖不卖,直接卖。 卖了再说。 然后做得不好,你还可以删呀,你还可以改呀。 我之前做小文书的一个方法就是每天拆一篇,每天先写一篇。 写完之后呢,每天先拆解一篇,就是拆一篇做我要对标的,它是怎么做的。 然后呢我就去仿写一篇。 然后仿写一篇之后呢,看数据,数据不好呢,我就再重新的去拆解。 然后去对原来的数据去进行改。 就是说你可以,你想去做一件事情有很多的方法的。 只要你先开始去做。 开始烂的这件事情,我觉得大家都有一个完美主义。 就是想说我一开始就能做好,不要有这样的想法。 而是先允许自由,做烂的自由。 先允许自己做得足够糟糕。 更何况,你现在也不出名呀,没人看你的。 就是很多时候你都会觉得很多人在看你,其实没有。 正是因为你现在不出名,所以你才可以足够的去摆烂,足够的让别人,足够的去掩饰,去试错。 但是一旦你出名了,你再想去试错就很难了。 一定要记住一句话就是,先完成再完美。 做完比做得好更重要。 就不要贪做得有多好,而是贪持续。 你知道有很多人,他都在做那种十万家,去追求数据流量非常好。 但是有什么用呢? 如果你十万家之后,你不具备持续生产内容的能力,那这个十万家对你来说不是礼物。 反而是礼物。 这是一个限制。 拖延着。 其实我们都想成为更好的自己,但其实你本身就已经在更好的一个状态了。 就是提醒自己,先完成再完美。 永远降低期待去做一件事情。 不要在期待当中给自己更大的期待,也不要把复杂的东西,也不要把简单的东西做复杂。 因为发笔记这个事情其实很简单。 但它为什么复杂? 就是因为我们去想吧。 难得不是发笔记这个事情。 难得是你会在想,我这个笔记发出来,有没有人看呀? 这个笔记数据怎么样呀? 我发了之后,别人怎么看我呀? 难得其实是你脑子里面的这些声音,难得从来就不是发笔记这个事情。 发笔记多简单啊? 你可能找一篇对标拆解,然后找到它的框架出来,然后去防写,然后就发出去了。 然后数据不好,OK,我迭代,然后去修改,再继续发第二遍笔记。 其实发的这个动作是很简单。 难得就是自己的内好。 动起来别什么都知道,就先开始去做。 做得好,你做得不好,你也要做得才知道好不好呀。 不好呢,就迭代它。 就我一直认为,就是我的观点,因为观点非常重要就是,我不说问题,我说解决方案。 我只聚焦我要到达的那个目的地是什么。 我不聚焦前面的问题,就像刚才讲那个故事。 就是你前面有堵墙,那你看到你就不过去。 但是如果说你那个目标就在后面等你,你知道你迈过去这个墙,你就能拿到这个果实,你就能拿到这个结果,你就能够去救到你的孩子。 那你过不过,你肯定要过的呀。 那你只是要去聚焦我的目标在哪里,你只专注我怎么解决我这些问题。 比如说像你们说,我没有决心,我没有动力呀。 那你只要闭上眼睛,迈开第一步就可以了。 就不要把简单的事情做复杂。 就是但凡你在做一件事情上面,你发现自己超过了20分钟,超过15分钟,你就开始内耗了。 做任何事情,你的时间差,就当你想到,当你去做的这个时间差越短。 那么你的成功率就越高,你的效率就越高,你的内耗就越少。 就我们最好就是训练自己,我要做一件事情,马上15分钟内就能够去做到,我要发比例。 好,我15分钟先把一个笔记给做出来。 15分钟可能做不了,但图文应该还可以。 我说完了,还有什么问题吗? 大家好,棒。 棒的问题。 谢谢。 谢谢你们一直跟我交流。 谢谢。 谢谢。 还有4分钟的时间,还有题文的话可以问起来。 谢谢。 谢谢。 谢谢。 谢谢。 谢谢。 谢谢。 谢谢。 谢谢。 谢谢。 Thank you. Any more questions? It's also a great ability to learn to ask questions. When you start, just do it. Find someone you want to imitate. Just compare them. Lu Jia also shared a lot of ways. To survive. There is a point here. If you have your own career, I don't mean to say that you should stop your career. But you should have this awareness in your heart. If you don't do things that are developing, your future, your survival, your future will be your own. How to say it? I don't encourage you to resign and do something. Or if you have your own political career, you can resign and do something. But you have to save time. Maybe you put your time to do survival. You have to use your time to do things that are developing. You have to have the determination to save time. Not to stop. You can't just say that you have to stop your survival. That's not what I mean. You can take it as giving yourself one more channel. Just like we say, how can I get more and more money? It's definitely not just one channel to make money. But there are many channels to make money. At the same time, at this stage, you have to learn to spend more time for the new channel. Let yourself have the ability to make more money. Just like this, I also said to myself, because I am practicing AI, the time for this thing is far from enough. But I said I want to master the tool of AI. It really doesn't work if you don't spend two hours a day. But if you don't spend time here, you will spend it elsewhere. Because everything needs time to support. Then I spent my time doing the original survival. I don't have time to do development. The best thing is to give yourself two hours or an hour a day to do development. After doing the development, then do survival. This is also what I said to myself. I also have to follow your steps and use AI tools. Yes, we can't use the original time structure to go through a new life. What does that mean? If you don't want to change your original time structure, your original way of spending time, you can't change your original way of spending time. You can't change your original way of spending time. You can't change your original way of spending time. You can't have a new state of mind. You might have to adjust your time. For example, which times are the most important? You have to spend time on the most important things. For example, which times can you not do? Then you have to give up these times. Then you have to think about how to get up early. How do I do writing? Because I did it early. I used to be not early. I don't get up early. But now it's summer. I get up at 4.30. I start my day at 4.30. I don't usually work at this time. I focus on my child from 9 to 10 after 7.30. But today, I want to give our boss a chance to share with you tonight. You have to adjust your time structure. What time structure? 10. What time is it? I've set up my own time record. My teacher also gives time. It's a time record. And the core point of it is your survival time. That is, your living and living time. For example, you cook, you do your hair. Your survival time and your transportation time. These two are the two times that can be cut off. Those are the times you can use to do things that can develop. For example, learning how to grow. For example, if I want to learn how to drive, For example, in the work industry, you spend your time on things that can make your future more valuable. When you have less time to travel and do more things in your life, you can have more time to do more valuable things. This is also the concept of the book, Nawa'a Baodian. When he was very poor, he learned to go out and pack his time, and put all his time on the outside, so that he could focus on doing things that would improve his value. Because they were investors, they had to go to the newspaper a lot, and read a lot of books and books. He spent all his time on these things. He never spent time on choosing what clothes to wear, or what to eat today. He always spent his time on these things. He never spent time on these things. He could make the simplest decision, and he would repeat the simplest decision. Yes. Actually, it's okay to get up at 4.30. It's okay if you get used to it. Because I'm a morning person. Okay, it's been an hour now. I've been talking to you for 30 minutes. I'm very happy. Thank you. Thank you for being with us tonight. That's all for today. Please leave your comments. The last thing I want to say is that persistence is more important than action. After you leave your comments, we'll say goodbye. Let me see your names. Thank you for your likes. Bye-bye, Jack. Bye-bye, Yisa and Wu. Bye-bye, Jack. Bye-bye, Yisa and Wu. Your names are all so special. I can't even pronounce them. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. If you want to make your own brand, you must have a name. If you use a symbol, or some English that's not easy to read, you need to have a lower level of recognition. You need to have a lower level of recognition. You need to have a lower level of recognition. Thank you. Thank you, Baoqi. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Okay. Bye-bye. I'll turn it off.",

So, that way you can better relate to this type of scenario where you're at your house and you're looking at your scenario and you want to shoot a good looking image that's a lot more, well a good looking scene or scenario that's a lot more casual. So, if we take a wide shot and get to see this entire place, we can see that there's three primary natural sources of light. And this is the most important part of choosing where you want to shoot in your environment. Here is the first option. We would have the subject facing the window so that the majority of the light would be hitting their face, of course. The problem with that is if we flip around, this backdrop. And here, we have the subject facing the window. Here, it doesn't look so good. We have this kind of stuff in the background. It doesn't look very clean, right? So, if we go to our next option, this is our second primary source of light. What we might be able to do here is open up this window so that we can have the subject facing the light. But as you can see from this image, there's really not a whole lot of natural light coming in through this window, at least at this time of day. So, that's something. That's something that you want to keep in mind is are you shooting at noon? Are you shooting at sunset? What side of your house is getting light at which time of day? If you're going to choose a more permanent setup at your house using natural light, that is something you really want to keep in mind, is what time of day do you want to shoot, and how is the lighting at that time of day? Here, if we were to set up the subject here, have the lighting, it doesn't work without really having to move around the different things at this height. house. So option two is really out of the question. Now, if we go to option three over here, we have this source of light that is coming in with a lot of diffuse light. We have Kimberly in the background doing her thing. So we have this large natural light right here. And the reason I went for this in this situation was because we have a light source that's getting great quality light for a lot of the different times of day. The way that the light is bouncing off the other buildings, the white fence outside is perfect for what we're looking for. The other reason I chose to do this and the other thing you want to keep in mind is how much can you control the lighting in the background of you when you're shooting in the natural light scenario. Here, we're able to really cut the light, meaning we keep the exposure of what is behind me very low. Okay. And then we can add practicals that you'll see in the following learning lesson of what the practicals are doing. And this is really the most ideal setup for this person's house, for Kimberly's place. So you're going to have a few different options at your house or wherever you want to shoot. You want to look at all your options. In this case, we had three. We weighed out the pros and cons of each option. And then we go ahead and choose where we want to shoot. And then we're able to choose where we want to shoot. And then we go ahead and choose where we want to shoot. And then we go ahead and choose where we want to shoot. And then we go ahead and choose where we want to shoot. And then we go ahead and choose where we want to shoot. And then we go ahead and choose where we want to shoot. Get our setup in, get our settings right, and get everything dialed in, which is what you're going to see in the next learning lesson.",

If there is a good store of virtue, then nothing is impossible. If nothing is impossible, then there are no limits. If a man knows no limits, then he is fit to be a ruler. The mother principle of ruling holds good for a long time. This is called having deep roots and a firm foundation. The Tao of long life and eternal vision. I had a bit of a hard time getting started on this video. The reason for this is that this chapter of the Tao Te Ching is one of the most important chapters in the whole text, and honestly I feel a little intimidated to tackle it, for fear that I won't be able to do the chapter adequate justice. But if there's one thing I've had to internalize throughout this Tao Te Ching challenge, it is that done is better than perfect, so I'm just going to do it. I'm just going to give it a shot, and who knows, maybe I'll come back and revisit it in a couple years from now and I can do it more properly then. The reason why I feel like this chapter is so important is because this chapter, to me, is the summation of everything we've talked about up to this point surrounding the concept of virtue and following the Tao. I think that this is all really, really important, so today I want to break down this chapter in pretty good detail to pull apart what's being said. So with that, let's start at the first couple lines. In caring for others and serving heaven, there's nothing like using restraint. In this particular translation, we talk a little bit about restraint. Another word that comes up in a lot of other translations is moderation. Whichever word you prefer to use, we are talking about the concept of not going too far, not trying too hard, not pushing your own agendas too extremely. We're talking about wu-wei, about acceptance, the ability to discern between the time to act and the time to merely observe. The chapter tells us that developing restraint starts with, the ability or the determination to give up one's own ideas when necessary. This doesn't mean that we can never have goals or plans, but it does mean that we are quick to let go of them when a situation calls for it, and that we are intuitive and discerning enough to know when this is necessary. We may have our own ideas or agendas, but we do not remain attached to them. We hold them loosely, and quickly and easily discard them when the situation calls for it. The next line tells us that the ability to do this depends on virtue gathered in the past. But what does this mean? When we make a conscious decision to follow the Tao, we gather virtue. Every time we follow our intuitions bravely, we gather virtue. Many people think that we become virtuous by trying hard to do good things, or trying hard to change ourselves to become more virtuous by sheer force of will. While the path to virtue does require us to change, and while it certainly does involve our willpower, it is not quite the same thing as this. The path to virtue primarily involves being close enough to Tao to hear our intuition. It is not about a mere thought that we are doing something, but rather about a sense of being close enough to Tao to be able to do it. The first step on this path is an intention to draw closer to Tao. As we make this our intention, and make time for quiet contemplation and meditation, we will begin to notice our intuition starting to take effect. New ideas will begin to form in our heads. We will begin to have feelings about what we should do next. These feelings will usually be small, and often they will be easy to ignore if we choose to do so. They will also often be inconvenient, and may not seem to make any sense at all. all. Often, they will urge us to act completely contrary to what we want to do with our own self will. But we can recognize them because even if they don't feel like something we want to do, they will somehow feel right. Acting on these urges will cause us to act in the best ways, even if they don't seem like the best at the time. If we postpone or ignore these feelings and urges, they will start to diminish, and we may even lose them completely. However, if we follow them immediately and courageously, over time they will start to come more often, and we will get better at understanding and interpreting them. As we continue to follow them, they will direct us to act in ways that will bring us closer to Tao. As we get closer to Tao, we will start to naturally change to become more like Tao. If you've ever felt like Wu Wei feels too nebulous or ethereal to be useful, then this is what it looks like in a practical, actionable sense. This is how to use Wu Wei in your life. This is also what is meant by virtue. All of our past determinations to follow Wu Wei, as indicated by our intuitions, bring us closer to Tao, which naturally causes us to increase in Te, or virtue. This store of virtue that we have built up over time lends to us an increasing ability to give up our own desires. As we increasingly give up our desires, we are able to act on higher levels of intuitional urges. As we receive and act upon higher levels of intuition, we attain to higher levels of virtue. Higher levels of virtue are the ones that we can use to achieve our goals. Virtue allows us greater levels of giving up our own desires, and the cycle goes on and on and on until we eventually become one with Tao. And we become one with Tao because we are like Tao. The further along we are on this path, the more we realize that nothing is impossible. The more things cease to be impossible, the less we are bound by the pitfalls and limitations that impede most people. The less we are bound by human pitfalls and limitations, the more fit we are to take care of others. Our virtue and our nature becomes grounded and we become more and more and rooted in Dao. Our foundation is that of Dao. This is the whole point of Daoism. This is the whole point of spirituality. This is the whole point of everything. Thank you so much for watching. There's a link to my discord in the description of the video in case you'd like to come hang out and talk about this stuff with other like-minded people. And with that, I will see you all tomorrow for chapter 60. Peace and blessings.",

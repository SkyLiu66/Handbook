And if any of you are not gardeners, kitchen people, the compost heap is where you throw all of the garden and the kitchen rubbish, the food scraps, you throw it all on the compost heap. And then it rots down. And a year or so later, you look around and you just have this lovely brown stuff that you can put on the garden out of which flowers and vegetables will grow. And I think it's really important for a writer to have a compost heap. Everything you read, things that you write, things that you listen to, people you encounter, they can all go. And they will rot down and out of them grow beautiful stories. I think the thing that you don't understand, especially as a young writer, when people talk about your influences, is the tendency is simply to go and look at the things like the thing that you do and point to them. So it's easier for me. Probably to point to Tolkien and Dunsany and James Branch Cabell, to Ursula Le Guin or P.L. Travers and say, well, I do stuff like this and I can point to those people. And what you don't necessarily point to is the stuff that does what you do, but is in a different kind of field or a different kind of area entirely. My wife writes songs. She makes music. She performs. She's a great singer. And what's important to her is emotional honesty, is truth. And she was probably in her late 30s before she realized that in all of the lists of influences that she would give when people would say, well, what are your influences? And she'd talk about The Cure or Leonard Cohen. She'd talk about punk bands. She'd talk about all of these things that she loved. She'd never talk about Judy Blume. Because Judy Blume, she was a great singer. She was a great singer. She was a great singer. She was a great singer. She was an author who she read when she was 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and an author who changed her and went in really deep and talked about honesty and gave Amanda the things that she wanted. For me, I never talk about Lou Reed. Lou was huge for me. And one of the reasons he was huge for me is he would write these songs that were like three-minute novels. There was a story in there, even if you weren't quite sure what it was, and it was complete. It was compressed. And it was very, very heightened because anything that happens with music is always incredibly heightened. And the choice of words in a song is so important because you don't have very many. So watching how Lou wouldn't tell you what to feel, wouldn't tell you how he felt, that the emotion would actually be almost pulled out. And I think that the idea that you can't just tell the story of the song because it's so deep, that it comes out of the song, but it will be there for you to interpret yourself was probably huge. It's something that I still love doing. What I write is I would much rather not tell you how to feel about something. I would rather you just felt it. I will tell you what happens. And if I leave you crying because I just killed a unicorn, I'm not gonna tell you how sad the death of Lou was. I'm not gonna tell you how sad the death of Lou was. I'm not gonna tell you how sad the death of the unicorn was. I'm gonna kill that unicorn and I'm gonna break your heart. That was something I think I learned from Lou. So your influences are not necessarily the things that you think they are. And your influences, you person watching this, who I'm teaching, I'm instructing, you're listening to me, remember that. Remember that your influences are all sorts of things. And some of them are gonna take you by surprise. But the most important thing that you can do is open yourself to everything. One of the things that's really fun as a writer is subverting expectations. And one of the places as a young writer, and frankly, as an old man, I think, is that I'm not gonna be able to do that. I'm not gonna be able to do that. But one of the things that you can do as an old writer, as a crusty, grumpy, aging writer, that's great to do, is to take apart a story that you're familiar with and inspect it new. See how it ticks, see what makes it work. Look at the things that people take for granted. A lot of the time, if you look at something that you're very, very familiar with, but just look at the things that people take for granted, you know, just look at it as if it's the first time. Turn it round, examine it from odd angles. Suddenly, it can open up into a story. Snow White might have been the very first ever story that I remember reading. It was certainly one of the first books I ever had. It was a beautiful illustrated Snow White. So, I've known that story since I was two, three years old. I must have read in that time, perhaps, in the mid-1990s, or 20s. I've been reading that book for years. And I just thought it was so beautiful. I just felt like it was the best thing I'd ever read. time perhaps a thousand different versions of Snow White, but reading it the thousandth time, I stopped and thought, you know, it's a pretty strange story. I mean, what kind of person has hair as black as coal, lips as red as blood, skin as white as snow, and gets to lie in a coffin for a year and then get up and they're fine again? And what kind of prince rides past on a horse and says, hey, that girl in that coffin, she's gorgeous. Can you bring her back to my castle? Because that's kind of weird too. And all of a sudden, I'm looking at something, which is a story that's that I've looked at a thousand times, as if I've never seen it before. And I'm going, well, if you view it from over here, you're telling a story about a vampire princess and a necrophile prince. And actually, if you tell that story, then the heroine of the story has to be her stepmother, who obviously was doing everything she possibly could to save the kingdom and protect everybody from her terrible, terrible, dangerous daughter. That's a story. So what I'd love for you to do is take a folk tale you're familiar with, take a fairy tale, a story that's, that's, that's owned by the world. Take that story and then just turn it around. Try and look at it for the first time. See where the bits are that don't quite make sense. See where it could be completely reinvented. And then write your own take on it. Try and make the people people. But tell that story. And then see where you got to. Find out where it took you. Use it as a framework, or use it as a mirror, or use it as something to bounce ideas off and see what you get. And the things that you put into it could be things that you personally care about. You can take a story and tell it now in modern days. You can, tell it in a Never Never Land time. But just try and make it yours. Try and make the people breathe and see what happens. I think something that's enormously fun for any young writer is just thought experiments, make up stories with the people around you. I highly recommend Train Carriage, Underground Carriages, Bus Journeys, anything where you have a bunch of disparate people that you don't know. Then look at them. Throw all of you into a situation you've never been in before and start wondering, well, okay, what would this person do? What would that person do? You know, the train is transported to a distant planet. Somebody in here has a heart attack. What happens if somebody gets sick? We get trapped and it goes on for days. And you just start making up little stories and you start playing with the people and realizing that actually people are so much more interesting and strange and more unlikely than anything that you could make up. So imagining that, going to a coffee shop, look at the people around you. Listen to what they're saying. Listen to how people talk. I used to have notebooks filled with either little overheard conversations or occasionally just conversations that I would have with people like bus drivers, where I would go, I don't believe I just had that conversation. I should write it down while it's fresh. And you almost never use actual lines that you hear. Or I don't. But they're still fantastic as sort of things to throw on the compost heap. If you ask an author, where do you get your ideas? The author will probably mock you. Authors have jokes. And they'll say, oh, from a little idea of the month club, or from a little idea. Or they'll say, oh, I get them from my friend. Or they'll just be horrible to you. This is because authors are scared and we don't know. And because we don't know and because we're scared, we lash out and we make you feel like you asked a stupid question. You didn't. You asked the big question. You asked the real question. Where do you get your ideas is a real question. And I used to do the funny answers. And then, many years ago, I went to my daughter's school when she was seven, eight years old. And I'm sitting there with some seven, eight-year-olds. And they're asking me about being a writer. And one of them says, where do you get your ideas? And I thought, I can't make fun of you. You're seven. And you have actually asked the only big important question. So I thought, I better give you a straight answer. And I thought for a little bit. And I said, well, really, I think you get ideas from confluence. Although I probably didn't use the word confluence because I was talking to seven-year-olds. I said, you get ideas from two things coming together. You get ideas from things that you have seen and thought and known about. And then something else that you've seen and thought and known about. And the realization, that you can just collide those things. And a lot of that, right in the beginning, can just be boredom. It can be looking out of a window. It can be, I love going to junior school and middle school kids' drama. You cannot escape. You are stuck there. You can't take out your phone. You can't read. You have to watch. And yet, the need to be elsewhere is such that you can absolutely go off and come up with some fantastic ideas for things. Ideas. Two things coming together. For example, everybody knows that if a werewolf bites you, you will become a werewolf when the moon is full. That's an idea. The what-ifs, the I wonder where those, the places where you go with that, can be things like, well, okay, so what if a werewolf bites a wolf? Would you get a wolf that turns into a different wolf when the moon is full? What if a werewolf bit a goldfish? Would you get a goldfish that became hairy and came out of its bowl and killed people? The full moon. What about a werewolf that absentmindedly started chewing on a chair? Would you get a chair that turned into a wolf? Would this be a chair wolf when the moon is full? And at that point, you're suddenly starting to play around with that. You're going, okay, so now we get bodies found with their throats ripped out and in the mud, nearby, you just have the marks of a chair leg. You'd have the moment where the great detective is sitting in the library as the full moon slowly rises, and he's figuring this out. And just as he starts to figure it out, he realizes that the leather chair that he's sitting in is starting to get hairier and furrier, and it's starting to move. And now, you have something that you've really had aBackground voice. It's like, oh, I'm going to wake up in the morning, and I'm going to wake up in the morning. And I'm like, oh, I'm going to wake up in the morning. I'm going to wake up in the morning. I'm going to wake up in the morning. I'm going to wake up in the morning. I'm going to wake up in the morning. I'm going to wake up in the morning. I'm going to wake up in the morning. You've really got a couple of scenes there. It's not yet a plot. It's just moments from a plot. But now you have something that you could build up from and you can build up to. And you can go, okay, what would happen, what would have to happen before that in order to make a story? What happens after that? Can you shoot a chair with a silver bullet? Would that work? What does it do? Does it turn back into a chair? Um, how do you destroy a chair that is coming after you up the stairs? And you begin to just rethink. And really, that's just confluence. That's things coming together that you have seen a thousand times, but you just look at them in a slightly different way. And now you have the beginning of a story.",

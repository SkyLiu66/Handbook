The first two classes we started, we will talk about something very important today. Today is the second class, we first talked about positioning, and then we talked about the specific personality creation series. So what is personality? Since I said this, I will interact with you first. Come on, friends, let's take a look at this interaction. We only look at the notes of this single article, and then we guess how many fans of this blogger are there. We can guess. Okay, let's look at the first one first. This is a life perception. Oh, I'll adjust this page a little bit. This way of showing is really not very convenient to adjust. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'll put this on. Okay. Let's take a look. Okay, this is a girl's post. This girl posted a post saying, I'm a little in love with the middle-aged travel group. And then this is a life-like travel record. And then this travel record has 10,000 likes so far. It's been 10,000 likes in two days. There are more than 2,000 interactions. You can guess how many fans she has. You can guess how many fans she has in the comment area. Oh, oh, the comment area. See if there's anyone who can guess it. I'm see see. Hello, is there anyone there? Hey, the internet is fine. Ah, is there anyone guessing? Guess. You can guess. Just guess. Just guess. You don't you don't cheat. You don't go to her homepage to search for her fans, okay? You guess. Nobody guess? Or am I stuck? No. That's right. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. No, I don't. I guess it's 2000. 1000, 1050. I guess it's 50. OK, I guess it's 50. OK, let's go down. Let me tell you. This girl has a lot of battlefields. I'm not kidding. This girl has a total of 51,000 battlefields. This number is exaggerated. I've been doing this for more than two months. And I have more than 20,000 fans. My battlefield is almost 100,000. But she has only 734 fans. Only 734. We can take a look at her main page. It's a bit messy. She shares some tips on life from time to time. And sometimes she has some big money. Look at this one. She has more than 7,000 battlefields. She has a daily life record of 13,000 battlefields. But she has only 700 fans. OK. Let's guess the next one. Let's guess the next one. OK. Well, this is a... I think this one is easier to guess. She posted a post called When she was in love, the shrimp had no shell. The first one is that when she was pregnant, her husband cooked a meal for her. This is the shrimp. She wanted to eat the shrimp. Her husband helped her remove all the shells. And this one has more than 4,000 likes. More than 400 interactions. You can guess. This girl's fan base. How many fans does she have? We can guess. You can guess. OK. This one has more than 5,000 likes. This is a big one. Guess how many fans she has. You can guess. Do you have it? More than 5,000 likes. More than 400 interactions. What's wrong with my comments? OK. More than 500. More than 300. You guessed a lot this time. This one guessed 70. You guessed high. This one has only 29 fans. Only 29 fans. And more than 5,000 likes. Basically, let's take a look at her main content. It's about privacy. Let's take a look. It's about her daily life. OK. So, friends. After that, let's talk about something. You can guess what I'm doing. What's the first question I asked today? Can you see the content that blocks fans? This is a little too much. We just guessed one. Because the first question I asked today is, is it as long as my fans, my little uncle, are popular? For example, this time, I sent a comment with more than 2,000 likes. More than 5,000 likes. My fans can immediately grow a few hundred thousand fans. Is that right? Do you think that as long as I do the content, I can grow fans right away? Do you think that as long as I take part in the exam, I can grow fans? Although this question is very original, I think it's a very good question. But it's not like this. Because the content is very original. It's very simple. I don't need to show you the content. I just want to show you the fan number. It's generally like this. Let me tell you. The content of the payment is not good if it comes too early. Why? I usually recommend that you continue to post something first. Post 20 or 30 content first. Then it's almost the 20th, 40th, 50th. Then you can go to the next page. You post 20, 40, 50, and so on. You suddenly post one. You suddenly post one. At this time, the timing when it comes to the payment is the best. If your payment is coming, it's when you're not completely human. You suddenly have a payment. So sorry. This payment is completely wasted for you. So today I'll tell you about it. First of all, the first thing. Why did you pay out of the money but not grow fans? There are three reasons. Let's remember these three reasons. First of all, the content is not lucrative. There is no value for the person. What is it? Do you know? There are two types of payment content. What is the first one? The first one is that he may think that this thing is a little interesting. I'll give you a collection. I'll give you a praise. If you can continue to bring me something interesting, then I might see you after about 10, 20, 30, and 40 pages. I'll pay attention to you. This is called emotional value. But this is not what we mean. This is what we mean when we say that we are not interested in the content. This is the only way to make money. So if you want to spend money, you can spend it. I'll give you a little bit of money. I'll give you a message when you have read many pages, then he may say that Actually, and the excess money shows you that this is not what you are interested in. Or maybe a point a little Which app, a fewHAHA teammates not appear classel But do you know fans? Every time I go out, it's eitherro finals, Tamee files.amen The most effective is very simple I will directly provide you with the value of the use of the For example, let's take a look at those English bloggers Teach people to write, teach people to operate, teach people to do what Ah, dry goods skills, including what to teach What ppt, excel, word, office, this kind of blogger Their bloggers with this kind of strong reliability Their rating rate is probably Ah, seven or eight likes Even three to four likes, one to two likes is one fan This is a typical of reliability I can use it after I learn it But we will find that you see this blogger He sent a what Open the closet is full of shirt This is a seven or eight likes Everyone thinks, well, I've hit the spot in my life I'll give you a compliment Then we look at it again I fell in love with the old age travel group He praised the old age travel group Then everyone is quite interesting Pointed a good So including this Right? Husband loves it I got a ppt I'm so touched I'll give it a thumbs up But you'll find that he provides emotional value They have a very typical of the value of reliability What can I learn after I see it? This kind of thing His thumb up His thumb up and the interaction rate He may have a high point of interaction But his rate of growth is not going up Because everyone is going to continue He only has one way to get high That is, you send things every day There are people who can provide a lot of emotional value You may be able to go up But this thing is hard to control You can't control this thing well Then what's the second one? Content and personality positioning are not in line No good flow I'll tell you something This is really important Why? Let's see You see He's a little in love with the old age travel group What should it be? It should be a I think it should be a travel blogger The thing that came out If he's talking about everything he said earlier What about the old age travel group? What kind of life record vlog? Then there is no doubt After this one is exposed He will immediately Maybe it's got three or four thousand fans Three or four thousand fans But we look at him before He sent a lot of different kinds of things What? Occasionally eat some food Occasionally take a picture Occasionally post some life records So in this case You'll find that his content The content of the money-raising It's not in line with his past personality He's not in line You're a A blogger who teaches English As a result, you made a math topic You think the fans will pay attention to you when it comes to math No Not to mention these bloggers They never have a personality It's not a personality The personality of the person is what I'm going to tell you today So this is the second one What's the third one No continuous output of the ability to pay back I don't have to talk about this anymore You see, you're going to have one or two He might be a lucky guy But if you can get a continuous Or a thousand or a hundred This ability Not everyone has it So the thing about paying back It's a good thing But it's too early In your thorough work Before you get your personality I'm sorry It's not a good thing It's really not a good thing So today I'm going to talk to you What kind of thing is it Here's the thing Today we're going to talk to you about the increase in the rate of growth What exactly is the increase in the rate of growth And why is the increase in the rate of growth high and low All right Today, let's take the next heavy goods We just got here today Early What's the decision about the increase in the rate of growth Friends Now let's assume you have a big hit But some people Some people may only grow more than ten fans Some people can go up to three or four thousand Even 70810 million fans Where are the differences Anyone in the comments section to answer Why is the rate of growth high and low Why is the rate of growth high and low Friends Did anyone answer in the comments area There is no comment section to answer Why are some people having a high rate of growth The rate of growth is very high, but the rate of growth is very low. Let's see if there is a treasure to answer. What's wrong with me today? No one wants to answer? Like is your current content, and follow is for the future content. So I want to increase the number of fans. Are you sure you can give him valuable content? This is right. But follow is not necessarily for the past and future content. He may think you are interesting. He may think that he will pay attention to something. Follow this behavior is indeed for the future content. But sometimes it decides whether he will pay attention to the moment of the arrow. It's not decided by the future. The steamed bun says the content is vertical. Is there any? The content is vertical and consistent. Can this be revoked? Let's see. The content is vertical and consistent. Okay. This question is very difficult. There are not many answers. Let me tell you. In fact, everyone has reached some points. But this point is not necessarily the complete answer. In fact, I think the rate of growth is low. What is the decision? First of all, the content is scarce. I told you before. The more you are scarce, the more you are online. Only you can produce this kind of content. Even if you don't do anything. Even if you post this content very much. The words are not in the script. The video is also very bad. But only you produce it. Your attention will be very high. What is the second thing? What is the second thing? It's called the first impression of the user on you. Right? I'll tell you something very important. Friends, have you been on a blind date? The comments section of the blind date here. Let's do this. Blind date is too personal. You didn't have a blind date. Hit a one. You didn't have a blind date. Hit a one. Okay. You didn't have a blind date. Hit a one. Okay. The second thing. Blind dates. Blind dates have a very, very important thing. What is it? Is it possible to decide whether you are successful on a blind date? With the other person. With the other one. Whether it's a girl or a man. Whether it's possible to decide whether you are together in the second half. It's often your first date. If you say. You are in your first date. If they don't perform well. It's hard for them. Turn around again. Turn your first impression again To have your second date with you Often when the object is willing to have your second date It's basically already felt that you're the first impression of the person Right? You may have had a blind date This is not the first impression We all know that the first impression of this thing It's like a teacher How can you judge me through the first impression I'm a more introverted person You just have to be with me for a long time I'm sorry It's a very fast pace of events now You see, blind dates Don't say blind date A colleague's attitude towards you is good or bad It's often the first time you've ever been in contact with him The impression left If you first get in touch with him The impression is bad The probability of him contacting you next time is very low Let alone turning your impression Right? And then what Besides, let alone We are now a very high A fast-paced society A lot of people are WeChat contacts At this time you will find the first impression is bad You haven't been with him for a long time The second time to change this time So the same When you pay attention to someone It's important that this dot It's also the first impression So good friends The first impression When did this thing decide It's very simple It's when this blogger sees your content And then click on the moment you go into your main page It's decided Click on the moment you go into the main page It's decided Haven't so many people believed it Oh, my God You're all human Flowers bloom Come on ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ok friends What's the next interaction topic Please tell me How do you turn over one of the little red book bloggers' master page Let's do a five-point guess in the comments section Anyone tell me how you turn over How to turn a little red book to the master page Does someone say First impression Especially for us The first impression of a little red book blogger Often it is by his first time to translate the master page It's decided Okay, anyone here? Anyone here can tell me how to read a book and read the main page? First, read the main page, then the title, and see if the style is good. Okay, let's talk about it in detail. Let's talk a little faster. First, if there is no accident, what will you do in the first place? You will first look at its name, profile, and number of fans, right? Okay, what's the first step? Some people may look at the fans first, and some people may look at the name first. This order is not important. The first step is basically to look at the name and number of fans. Okay, so first of all, what kind of profile do you look like? What are the characteristics? If you look ugly, everyone will think that you are ugly today, right? If you look good, they will think that you really look good. But you will find that if you look good in this profile, or if you look interesting, do they think that you are this person? Do they think that the first thing is that they will be very confident about you? At least you dare to face me with a real face, especially when you are a person who looks good. Often a person who looks good, his or her looks are high, it is possible that everyone will think that I believe you very much. There is no way. People all have this beauty. This thing can't be compared. Of course, if you look bad, you can also improve your credibility in the future. In short, he will hope that the content of this note is the same as the image of your overall profile. This is the second demand. So what is the use of looking at the number of fans? Looking at the number of fans can first determine the user's judgment of your KW. Now, at this age, the fans will also look at your number of fans. If your number of fans is higher, it proves that the higher your content level, the higher the KW. They will comment on it and say that the teacher is a teacher. What is this similar to? It's a more respectful call to do something. When you are in the situation, but if you say that your number of fans is relatively small, they will call you the blogger. What is the blogger talking about? Then you will find that there is another thing. Often, when some fans are particularly big, many people are actually unwilling to comment. Why? Because you know that after I comment, you will not pay attention to me, but will trigger your dead fans to attack me. Right? So often, if you say that your number of fans is small, they may be more willing to comment. Because they will feel that they are more equal to you, and they are more willing to interact with you. This is quite interesting, right? Okay, the third is the name. First of all, this name will directly determine that sometimes the name is a gold sign. Your name can tell him what you are doing, right? For example, let him look at it and know what you are doing. It's a good name, right? Okay, so these are the three aspects. Second, we have finished looking at the number of fans of this name. What are we going to do next? Next step, look at the signature and self-introduction. Okay, what is the use of looking at the signature and self-introduction? Just one thing. First of all, can your signature have a bright spot? This bright spot allows me to remember you, right? This bright spot can be what kind of person you are, what you do, what past experiences you have, or some strange behaviors you have. I think it's more interesting. Is it just to make others remember him? Right? What bright spot can I remember? Okay, after reading the name, the image, and the number of fans, what's the next step? After reading this signature, does he have a basic impression of you? In the next step, he has to verify whether this impression is right, right? For example, your certificate says you are a college entrance exam, a math graduate, graduated from Peking University. As a result, your content is a pile of travel and exploration notes. At this time, you see that the content and your personality are not in line with each other. Right? He won't pay attention to you. So what will he do next? He will look at the background picture of your main page, the cover title and the title of the main page. Why is that? The first thing is that he has to judge your track and your personality by the content of the cover. Is it unified and vertical? Okay. He will brush it first. Brush it first. It seems that the content is in line with this content. Okay, next step. He may look at the background picture first. The background picture looks at your beautiful figure, the honor you have, the life you have, the data you have published, etc. These things are to assist in verifying your personality. Okay, what's the next step? Look at your cover of the main page. Is it unified? Is it consistent with my judgment of your expected personality? Okay. The next step is the most important. What is it? He will look at your top-notch notes or notes with better historical data. Right? Okay, at this time, he will click on the top of the screen. Two top-notch notes. Or he may just flip one. He may just flip one. Okay. But in general, he will probably click on the top note you put. So at this time, when he clicks, he will look at one thing. First, can you provide value for me? Right? Can you provide value for me? And then what? What to provide? On the one hand, it is emotional value. I said, let me be happy, let me be sad, let me feel bad, let me remember. The second kind of information gap. All kinds of different values of influence. Right? There are two kinds in total. So, okay. When it comes to this, it's basically already able to decide whether he pressed the button. Can you press the button? First of all, I'm going to tell you what kind of question I have. I'm going to ask you a question. What is the most important thing in your life? What is the most important thing in your life? What is the most important thing in your life? What is the most important thing in your life? What is the most important thing in your life? So someone said, ah, Teacher Luo, I do this, uh, I do this kind of food. I do this kind of funny stuff. These uh, he can, for example, I am now in a good position in the personnel, no matter if it is my name, signature, background, and fans, ah, what, I did it very well, and the history is very good. Then can my fan ratio reach one to two views, one fan? One to two likes, one fan. I tell you, it's impossible. Because if you have a fan, you can't do it. If you have a fan, you can't do it. If you have a fan, you can't do it. If you have a fan, you can't do it. If you have a fan, you can't do it. If you have a fan, you can't do it. I tell you, it's impossible. You can't, you can't. You can't. You pass. What I'm telling you today is that you have all these personnel, head, signature, background, picture, and history, and you can only reach a level that is more top of your track. More top of this level. But you can't go beyond this track to another level of track. A level of a level. Understand? I can create through personnel positioning, let your overall attention reach a level of attention. I can create through personnel positioning, let your overall attention reach a level of attention. I can create through personnel positioning, let your overall attention reach a level of attention. But you can't go beyond this track to another level of track. A level of a level of fan rate is another track. So we can only let you get to the limit of your top of your track by personnel positioning. But you can't go beyond it. For example, I'm doing domestic I'm five fans and a fan. I think this industry is very high. Some other bloggers may have more than 20 or 30 fans. But I can't be like Eric Xie Peng, like Fei Fei. He has one or two fans. I can't reach it in this life. This track has decided that he can't do such a thing. Understand? Okay. I'll emphasize it again. The first impression of the user of you is through such a short one, two, three, four, five steps. These five steps are also such a minute's time. Direct judgment of death. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. His first impression of you is trans divergence. Friends at that teacher said that the teacher if there is a chance to me I told you have no chance. why First of all, this second time I brushed to you, the probability is not so much. Not necessarily big. And at this time he no longer likes you. Click in again, the probability is lower. So pay attention to this thing. Whether you are going to an offline blind interview or not, for example, you just did an interview. User is HR. What about your interview? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. When you are interviewed. You were wearing shorts and slippers when you were interviewed And you're late You think at this time Even if you are so shy You are so talented You are so talented No matter how high the level of the king Do you think you can get a second chance No, it's impossible Impossible Now it's a fast-paced society All right So you must pay attention to your first impression This is the meaning of the personality All right Friends, then build a personality What is the whole process like It's actually about four or five steps How to build a good image How to build a good shortcut How to build a good account background And how to create your own history notes Understand So today's content is not difficult But you must learn this content Must learn First of all, how to make a good image How to reduce the trust threshold of users So What's the first thing First of all, let's give an example The same is a medical blogger These two images The same is a medical blogger who is a oral doctor Who are you more willing to pay attention to If you feel more willing to pay attention to the left click one More willing to pay attention to the right click two All right Let's take a look Let's have a look Let's do an interaction like this Although I know your answer But you can interact This one adds travels less know Ah Now, take a look We are the highest data level head similarly the head crystalacy hero l navigation level the Allow or reject thepiece is positive How to create a good picture on x 6 each and then put a button here on y cr-1 also What is your ideal image? No doubt. I highly recommend that you can directly show your real image, professional photos, or your life photos. But those clean background life photos are the best. I will tell you a very important thing. You will find that we all have a hundred words that are not as good as one. Let's take an example. Do you often go to the supermarket to sell insurance, finance, fitness cards, etc. All kinds of online and high-end consumer goods. Online and also decoration, right? Like decoration, buying a car, buying a house. These products are very popular. They may be recommended by your friends. After adding this kind of Internet and small business channel, they all want to talk face-to-face with you. Why do they want to talk face-to-face? It's simple. Because when people have the strongest sense of trust, they will talk face-to-face. It must be the most direct encounter between people. Such a strong sense of trust is the highest. Don't think about what this kind of high-end price can do. You can buy through WeChat, through voice calls. You will find that the lowest connection between people is communication between words and words. The second is probably the voice. The third must be the highest. It must be face-to-face. Why? The same. So if we are doing a portrait, we of course show our true face, our true appearance to everyone. Such trust is what people can get from being born. It's the gene that is born in the bones. So it's best to find your true image, life and career. This is the best. If you are willing to take a picture, you can find a genius. I personally don't like genius. You see this image is taken by a genius. I personally think he looks different from me. So I can put it out and show it to everyone. Or you can find a connoisseur. You can find a connoisseur yourself who can see your true face clearly. This life photo is also fine. Of course, if you are a professional, for example, you are a lawyer, you are a doctor. My suggestion is that you wear your suit. For example, the doctor's white coat. You lawyer wears a suit. Then take a group of photos. This is called a professional portrait. Its connection is also the strongest. And the trust is also the highest. Of course, some people will ask, Teacher, I look good. I just don't want to show my face. How to do? Including me, who may be a sensitive profession. For example, I am a state-owned enterprise. Party and political organs. I dare not do the job of a rich man. I have such a demand. So actually, it's good to listen to the next step. Next step, you choose to use mid-journey to make a portrait. Next step, use MJ to make a portrait. Then, pay attention. If this part is two months ago, when MJ didn't go out so hot, this step may be for everyone to find. For example, to find a portrait shop to do customization. Then, it's not needed now. This kind of T1 level, which is able to make people see the credibility. Its credibility is not the strongest, but it can also make everyone happy. This is the threshold of reducing credibility. The portrait is actually divided into three categories. MJ can be produced tonight. Which three categories? The first category is called the portrait of a bad person. You will find that in the early years, many emotional accounts, almost every woman will develop a multi-textỸ figure. She would have a short-lost image of herself. Then, she can't with this. Because people won't understand the장 and her направl. Does it? Alexand filters are very important. No matter how brazenally school- 내일 There are numerous questions about it. Next, It diciendo that you want your picture photo to be this colourless, and remember toず invite her home. Rather than consuming the embraced atmosphere inside, careful and considerate, try to dress this picture. That is contouring the image. Then it becomes a style of fragrance. In those circumstances, Then add your professional image appearance Then this shape and this dress A tree goes in Leave some with you Some background pictures and elements related to your image Is it good, right? Okay, the third one is what I have created with you before You are using this kind of Picasso style This kind of woman's portrait What is it actually like It's actually a similar portrait of a real person But you used a cartoon 3D style to make it A 3D woman's portrait Okay, there are three kinds of these three keywords I'm going to give you the template here The first one is a cartoon type of Promote template Let me show you First of all, this is the action and the image description You can use DeepL or use this white translation I wrote this is a young woman With short hair and a cat on it And then this cartoon style I chose this kind of cartoon style The style of the This is called digital art Illustrator this this this style Then the camera holding the camera And then you see the high contrast line style The video is a little bit more Let's try a few Let's try two Let's try two I'll give you the Promote directly All right I opened our old friend again This MJ All right, I'll open my MJ And then at this point All right, let's generate, right? All right, what's this trick? I've said it before All right Okay, so I've got it We're going back a little bit, right Alright, this to the girl Our hands on the camera Right? Let's go into this at this time It's different Change an death It's different Let's do this Interían Let's get one of our terms We look for one ah Chang Tou Fa Nian Qing ah Niu Sheng and then, ah, Dai Zhe Yan Jing um ah Young Girl With Long Hair and Eyes and then, I will copy the main body Next Okay, this style is a simple poster, a cartoon poster and then Illustrator copy and paste Next, choose this high contrast style Actually, you can just search for the image and use it You can not only use this you can search for it yourself I have told you before Okay, now I will look at this douhao, right? This douhao is wrong Fent Style Distance Pro Distance Pro Distance Pro At this time, I will change the douhao of these key words It was the douhao of Chinese Okay, it should be right now Okay, at this time, we will directly generate Okay, put it back This is the first image Then we now copy the second The second is this called this cartoon style, right? I told you about this cartoon style So this cartoon style is this this good good right Then let's talk about it first What kind of character is he Then what kind of clothes he is wearing What kind of clothes In fact, what we want to change is this, right? What kind of person is wearing what kind of clothes Then what kind of thing is he wearing His action Let's take a look This is the structure of the image This is the structure of the image Then Post Pro Post 3 High Color Long Hair and Eyes Chrome Zod Simple Light Distortion This is the image of the head Then you can try it specifically Then this is the financial We'll change it first What did you change at this time Doctor, right? We changed it first Doctor This doctor Financial We changed it to this This is the doctor We changed it to this Medical industry entrepreneur Medical industry entrepreneur Medical industry entrepreneur Doctor Super Super Super I'm so hard to write This translation is not right We look at it again Wearing white pants Then With glasses Wearing a white coat Doctor Doctor's white coat and eyes Doctor's white coat and eyes With glasses Wrong White coat and glasses White coat and glasses I changed this So now Change a professional background He is a Clean white contrast background I think this is almost Almost Then the next step we look at the character's emotions He is this is What does it mean I forgot to search Effort Then OK no problem Then this emotion does not change So now We directly The following is Zhao Chao We will directly copy it and see this Super Doctor Boy This is the second paragraph OK Then the next step Next step Next step OK, let's adjust the style Next step Next step Next step Next step Next step Next step Next is this The image of the Picks style This kind of I have four models in total Then you need to have a map in it Yes, you need a map If you don't have a map, it won't look like this Then these four models You can adjust it yourself I told you about this You just change it to a girl and then change it to a boy This is what you can change to a man Then what about this color I won't show you this I've shown you this Look at this character Look at this cartoon character Right Let's see I have a good U2 and U1 Right Look at this At this time, these characters will appear Right If you even want to add another picture in front of you Add another picture Will it be more similar Right OK This is the doctor So in our class Everyone has learned it I personally I hope you can do it like this This is the AI production image These styles Then this is called professional 3D cartoon Then 3D pix style 3D you can have this kind of light These three types are all OK In addition If you really don't want to show your face For example You are a brand For example, what are you doing now We We want to do the painting of this student You may not be able to do this person Then this You can choose to use objects Or with the industry Cartoon related to the drug Do some three-dimensional rendering Can also be used as a portrait For example, you do a painting Right Then you make a 3D scene rendering of a painting Like this 3D scene rendering Right Like this medical industry Use ambulance Can be used to deepen the user's positioning It can also be But it may be difficult to reduce the threshold But it can be further customized This is also OK, right Then The word model is like this Promote model First of all, the front is the word of the object You go to translate it yourself Next is sculpture materials It refers to sculpture materials C4D is its tool Cinema 4D is the style of this tool Then below is Minimal Cute style Then clean background 4K then AR 4 to 3 is the ratio 4 to 3 size Let's take an example For example, let's find one now Of course I need to explain to you You may think of this picture With his deep painting May not be very unified So we have to think of a relatively English and Chinese Are more close to a word More objective word For example, painting For example, painting Then we translate a What do we translate Ah Ah A painting This Appending Appending Then we copy this appending Then what is the model Let's copy it a little OK sculpture materials C4D Minimizing OK Painting This is the first paragraph So the painting If the painting is not accurate Let's try the drawing Let's copy it you can see that the painting is not the same as it should be the painting is the one that you created what are we thinking of? we are thinking that it can show a painting a painting, a painting frame let's change it what do we think of? a painting frame let's use a painting frame picture frame so you see, the thing that is described in detail is not the same as what he imagined so we have to think of something relatively objective so that he doesn't think of such a naive word ok, you see, the second one is right, right? you see, the painting is still right the painting is still right, right? the painting is still as possible as close as possible to us see? I think the fourth one and the second one both have that kind of painting feeling especially the fourth one, right? I think the fourth one can be used as a portrait a painting, right? a painting ok, let's look at this picture frame ok, this one seems to be a good match, right? you are also a good match ok, so he is sometimes he thinks too much, you know? his this his model will add a lot of details he will add a lot of details right? for example, let's look at this is very typical this model will add a lot of details his this so you have to think more objectively you see, I write a legal template he thought very correctly, right? you see, it's the legal industry including, if you want to make it more obvious, you help this background, right? this black one this black one may be more unified well, then you see this ambulance he added a lot of details, right? you like this second one I think this one and three are still like the ambulance this two and four added a lot of details and then the same computer display you see I think one and four are still ok and then this two and three he added details so I want you to mix it up and send a few more words send a few more words as much as possible to choose this kind of he can't think too much of that kind of word do you understand? good the last one is also a good one ok, so this is a good one, right? this is the one I don't recommend the most it's called pure text image this is better than no image this is better than you don't have an image it's called pure text image you can draw it casually you can draw it with a ppt many of you are ppt students you can use ppt to pick a few strokes and draw it it's ok it's ok at least it can tell others what you are doing this is also ok in the end, you can't do it you can't even do this image I think no one should be able to do an image at this point right? I think you can't do it you can't do it you can't do it but you can do it you can draw some cartoon you can draw some specific objects it's ok, right? at least we've come this far right? don't make an image with text I beg you, ok? ok this is about making an image ok, next how should we get a good name friends I told you about a good name you can tell others directly what you are doing right? so, what I recommend is these four principles first, simple and easy to remember second, easy to write I've talked about this a lot I've been through a lot I've been through a lot first, you should remember the name it's easy to remember it's easy to remember but writing is easy let me tell you for so many years I don't know how many people have called my name wrong they helped me to change the word from the word to the word there are countless that word someone called me someone called me when I was typing they removed the word there was only one word and then they changed the word to the word and then they added the word I'm telling you I want to make a person remember my name it's very hard to do it today so I highly recommend you to get yourself a relatively easy name to write believe me most of the Chinese users they don't have this quality don't think your name is really easy to write hello some people will some people will pronounce hello or something I have so writing is easy it's really important it's really important understand so third platform unity you can't use some words that the platform doesn't agree with right for example dick some weird English words are not agree then platform must be unified the side of the word is called side of the word so advanced sorry my cultural quality is limited look even my name what is the side of it the cultural level is not high right let alone the local people this yes it's corrected very good there are some language teachers this well so third platform unity is what I hope everyone can do online I hope everyone can do online why do you want to be online because it's more convenient to the end we do the word of mouth understand online online and then the fourth is called uniqueness there is still a certain uniqueness so you see this this is you still have a little bit of it you still have a little bit of uniqueness you can't call it what this Chen Yong Chen Wei right Xiao Wang you must have some more unique things unique things can be post-sadness can be pre-sadness or even add some sub-words so first of all the first thing the first method you can use the long name or real name but more suitable have a certain this kind of thing is more suitable have a certain influence or brand IP or star and so on I'll wait for everyone I'll wait for everyone I'll change this with him what do you call it long name ok let's take a look so for example Lei Jun, right? All the net net name Lei Jun Li Dan, all the net name Li Dan He doesn't even need to say what he does And put this name out Including what kind of Tofu flower What Luo Yonghao, Luo Zhenyu They just put their names out This is already His influence has surpassed the platform Just look at his name All know what he does So this is social influence To a certain extent Or your company's name The company's brand After a certain brand influence Like Ma Huateng He never used to Ma Yun never said what Ma Yun was doing Just put your name out This is already a brand name But ordinary people can't get it I generally recommend ordinary people The second option is to add a verb Add your skills to the track or characteristics For example, you are a English teacher Then you can say what Little Wang teaches English, right? This one is a math teacher What do you call it with him? Ah, Xiao Li teaches math, right? Including you are a teacher Internet operation Teach professional education What can you do? What? Ah, what? This is not a non-interference interview, right? Not a job interview, right? And then what? Say what? What? What do you love? What? What do you talk about? Right? Like I'm showing you this one Roller said operation He's obviously talking to you about it An online operation related content blogger And then the second 77 loves to write What do you look at? It's typical to talk to people about writing Including what? This writing Of course, what is this writing? Writing the normal adult's love of writing You also divide into what? Writing What else? What do you think he's talking about? He's talking about this written language He's talking about written language If I change it to 77 loves to write Ah, 77 loves to write This will be more abstract So the other This is a white-mail content He's obviously a teach someone Teach others to do new media Do this kind of IP-related blogger This kind of what? What do you call love? What do you call like? What do you call can do? What are you doing? What are you talking about? This kind of thing is suitable for positioning A whole track of three-way tracks All right? Oh, I'm unemployed No, you can't write this kind of negative vocabulary You know? You can't write negative vocabulary Negative vocabulary will reduce everyone's interest in you Of course, if you're a funny blogger For example, you're a funny blogger Right? You can write You can write So the third professional career plus a title This is, for example Want to show your professional and professional advantages What do you know? Psychologist Cha cha cha Right? And then what? Ah What? Chef Cha Cha Lawyer Cha Cha Cha Right? And then lawyer Xiao Li Lawyer Xiao Wang What lawyer Nicola And so on This kind of and so on Is to put your professional potential Like what doctor Teacher Including like this kind of professionalism More powerful What kind of medical psychology Professional what Physical therapist This kind of thing can be done This kind of very deep professional threshold Put it in front Right? Like what we're doing now Do new media This kind of thing is relatively low More three-way and nine-way We're embarrassed to put this thing in front Right? We're all behind it Right? But if you're doing something more advanced That's more advanced You're a nuclear physics professor You got the Nobel Prize Then you put the Nobel Prize in front Winner Right? What legal expert Blah blah blah blah This is the professional advantage With professional advantage Very strong career Put it in front Put it in front Financial expert Blah blah blah This The fourth kind What? Nicheng Add a sentence Let people remember the title This is more domineering This is relatively speaking Is more domineering For example This is more suitable for ambitious Ah want to be the head The head of the track For example The following sentence It's all relatively domineering Right? And then you look at the example Like me Very typical The national I didn't get it right I wanted to be an IP I want to be an IP But I've always wanted to understand What other names I'm going to name Except for the family And then I just tapped four words Jimu diary I didn't think about it The first one is on fire Ah, after the fire I can't change it You know what? I can't change it So I got a lot of new IPs Just add some more afters What? What? That one Ah, Aze I got myself a name back then What's called Aze I don't feel too good I just think Jimu diary is a big word Forget it I just put it on I don't care Anyway, it's okay And then I think it's not enough Not cool enough Not cool enough Because I want to be the first in the national team I added a bar at the back Hey, the national Jimu recommendation officer This kind of general plus a bar The one with a few words at the back Because in general They're all ambitious Think about being the head of this track How dare you For example, another one This wild bodhisattva One bar The strongest AI painting lesson I told you He's already relatively head of the track Do AI teaching AI painting teaching He can really hold up the strongest What's the bar What's the lesson Such a title design So? And in the national Jimu I'm relatively more vertical So I'm adding a bar at this point No one said But if it's just the beginning It's going to be laughed at So in general I'm more suited to it You've already done something There's a certain track After this position Go do this again It's okay It's okay Including you see My this is even better I wrote this little book Chief Jimu recommendation officer I think it's a little too much I'm going to add a few words I added a word seal Including you see him This is his introduction The most comprehensive You can do the most of them It's all about violating the ad law But it doesn't matter We're just a short notice ah AI partner Double publisher AI expert It's good to see something like this Okay So the fifth You're in every screen Keep a need Need to Need to keep a You can slightly modify For example, I have this Jimu diary National Jimu recommendation officer I'm in I'm in B-Zai He's a little too long He's a little too long So I changed my Jimu diary The national Jimu But the first four words I have to match You have to match your typical IP But your nickname can be a little different You're a little different In Douyin That name doesn't really fit On Douyin I might just call it Jimu diary Because the back plus In Douyin The cultural environment He doesn't really fit The same If you register public number Can you get such a strong name on public number Such a long name You can't get it right You can't get it Because public number When he posted the article His title was 15 to 20 words You've got a lot of names The ghost can see your title So in public number Am I the only one who can write Jimu diary These four words Right? So you have to be fully online But you're behind the IP You're a full-on online But you're behind the back You can adjust it according to your specific platform Understand? This is according to their own platform Adjusting with their own operation method For example, this wild bodhisattva I think he's going to be public Maybe it's called wild bodhisattva He won't add words at the end Understand? good in addition The fifth kind of Area plus Where to play Something like that What's the Thai Oli And then what's this Thai A Hang You see, it's in Thailand Talk about things related to Thailand Australian shopping army He's talking about business in Australia So this one It's more suitable for you You can use local resources What Australia Foreign resources This kind of blogger For example, you're doing a foreign trade business And then what did you do What's the local life of the coal mine Overseas life type of blogger So at this point You can put your hell in front of you Put hell in front of you Right? Okay, the last one It's called the company brand name plus your family service This kind of thing is actually taken less Ha, there's a little bit of that It's been a few years A few years ago There's not much less these days A few years ago there was a kind of special internal push And then there's this kind of internal push It was a few years ago When the Internet was hot It should be an internal push They're like that For example, like Tencent and Huawei They should be a push Recommend successful They can get a recommendation of $4,000 to $5,000 This recommendation bonus Right? Feifei should know And then you might have taken it Right? This kind of recommendation Recommend entry at the same time And so on So someone put this business on the small book Just anyway This thing I recommended the number of people The more the better The more successful he is The probability is none of my business But I can only enlarge this pool Right? I get more recommendations I'll give you my internal push Ah, right Just like this As long as you succeed in internal push I can make money It's a white cut They're a lot of people What's the front For example, the goose farm Bala bala bala Special internal push business And then? He sent something Is the need for internal push Come and find me Come and find me He sends me this every day Some people are going to search for it What goose farm internal push What's this Tencent internal push This white internal push You can find them And then they text He just sent this internal push code Just sent it over Anyway, I don't care so much I push it all The higher the probability The more people come Maybe this one is more likely to pass And then they did this Yeah, look at the paper And the phone That's a lot That's a lot So this is generally suitable Including You know, there's another one What's the typical business of a big factory rent rent You know, Huawei in Shenzhen That's the one in Bantian That's the one in Longhua Bantian A lot of people are specializing in Huawei rent Bala bala bala Huawei Bantian rent Bala bala bala And then there are a lot of people Strongly in the heart of the name Because a lot of people are thinking about Searching for that kind of rent They'll go through what Huawei What do they give They say they are what Huawei came out of Why is this Huawei person Specially providing the best rental business cooperation And then you don't charge the intercom fee And then Bala bala bala this thing And then You just have to go with a big brand Company employees Because Huawei has tens of thousands of people in Shenzhen He can always get a lot of people to do this And then? You have this brand resource for big companies Or for the company People who provide services So this is a typical one In front of a big brand company Then what Geli Dong Mingzhu Right? So Yeah The housing intermediary Who told me I'm telling you I'm in Shenzhen now I made an office I made a studio Studio And then? My studio The intermediary I found it on the small screen I found it on the small screen Because I watched it at that time I saw it on the small screen I saw it on the small screen Because I saw it on the small screen This is the original area The price is relatively cheap I want to be 70 or 80 pints 60 or 60 pints I'll just search I'll search for something around here What's this? Some place Shenzhen Bantian rent a house Shenzhen Bantian rent an office Then I saw a small book Take me to the street It's okay, right This kind of business is typical There are many in the world All right So let's sum it up There are six ways The first one You use your real name or your real name But I don't usually recommend it I don't recommend it either You learn what? What's your real name CC Coco Lala Rola or something like that Don't write it directly Unless you have a big name Unless you have a big name Or your name Your name is very unique You're called Wang Goudai Then write it, okay Unless your name is very unique Hey, you write it But I don't usually recommend ordinary people To use this way of naming Okay, I usually recommend these two The first is the nickname plus the verb plus the mood characteristic Right? What? This is Li's favorite writing Li talks about operation The way to write This is usually more appropriate And then the third one Professional and professional plus nickname This is also appropriate It's also appropriate All right And then the fourth one Nicheng plus a line Can let people remember a title You can also And then the fifth one Area plus Nicheng plus service and skills The sixth one Company name plus brand name plus Nicheng plus service skills All right There are six in total All right So this is the name So now about naming and avatar Hey, we're done with this thing What's next Next step is very important But what have to be done This is very important To you That's how you get it Is it okay to write this interface Can you just decide if he can remember you Can you remember you Okay, then you should learn from Fei-fei Well, the elements of the interface are actually very simple But the elements of the interface actually have no problem The first one is to tell you who you are What are the characteristics of the second third What kind of value can you give to the user fourth A bright golden word or word can let everyone remember In fact, the core is the fourth sentence Need a bright golden word Let everyone remember you In fact, no matter how much you write this introduction No matter how many words you write, hundreds of words It doesn't matter It's not very important The most important thing is that there is such a word Let everyone remember it Just one word So in a few hundred words Just write the core word No matter what you write in which sentence As long as you write it out, it's ok So first The first key to the introduction is to tell everyone who you are Right? Who are you So first of all, what is your profession What is your professional background What is your work experience For example, look at this The left is Wang Pei ppt He used to be a full-time colleague of mine Then he wrote that he was an independent ppt trainer Plus designer Did you tell everyone who I am What is my profession And then the math teacher He said it was a math teacher in the fifth grade of the school What kind of work experience does he have What kind of professional background Who am I What am I doing The second thing What are your characteristics Usually you can write your own honor Or you have an interesting experience in your life Let me give you an example If I say If I say I'm a teacher in the Luo family If I say I For example, I'm going to get another IP now What did I do What is it It's a professional thing I'm more of a personal show Not like the Golden Book It's that kind of obvious life blogger I'll write a word What two months of weight loss 50 pounds Ah, this kind of word And then what Ah, two hundred pounds of fat I may not be good But I want you to remember me You see And then what's so special about it For example, you see me before the official account I can write Two hundred pounds of Luo's teacher Right Two hundred pounds of fat What's under what's the bubble Two hundred pounds of this thing Actually, it's not good What do you remember me Ah, but it's okay It's not particularly negative I think he's a neutral word And then What's so special about your resume Let's remember it You see, you see this American real Four months of weight loss Thirty pounds Right Like Feifei Gap a year Right The big factory is Gap a year Gap a year This thing is really pretty Pretty, pretty, pretty Let everyone remember And then the other Let A Pei say What do you want to do You have a goal You can write down your goal What's his goal Ah, I'll do a hundred-page ppt revision for you This thing is also a great career Right It's also a great career And then your honor is great Like this senior from Peking University He went from Hideng Jiwa to Peking University Peking University of Literature and Literature And then Learn the four S level of the famous poem Just write one It's awesome You write it down Special things in the resume What career do you want to accomplish What achievements have you accomplished Or what are some of your life's most typical characteristics Let's remember What are your characteristics in the second paragraph Ah, the third paragraph And then what value can you bring to the user That's what I see What's the use of that And then what can the user get after reading the account Hey, you can't see it very clearly I'll zoom in on that for you X is selling this point It's annoying You know what? But I think this process can be optimized I'm going to think of a way to make X sell it fast See? Okay, I can't zoom in anymore You're already at the end You should be able to see it clearly Okay, look at this Dr. Lee Good at blah blah blah blah blah blah And then what's the special blah blah blah blah That's what I can offer you Right And then you see Share with you Personal growth Ah, self-publishing, making money, self-media dry goods And then what's next Use medical technology skills You see, if it's this part in here He'll write some keywords What's that Ah, the division is divided For example, what he will write You see, this is very typical Personal growth Self-publishing, making money, self-media dry goods What kind of content can I provide I'll write the keywords for you Right So this is the key word to do the division And then this one What can I do with this word Share it with you All right So That's a pretty straight forward Or not Right If you have a problem and your relationship緩rd If you drop out The teachers and parents will be worried So how wrong So this is what I do This is what you do U p I want to listen to filter What do you like Can you wrap up Find me in the chat Above first Apply music ok So that's one of you I spent about three months on this I finally figured out a word that I think is relatively memorable You'll find out every word you read You read carefully These four words in it These four words Look at that One, two, three, four words These four words Every word I basically struggled for a week or two Only one word came out Then you see the chief of the small red book I'm the chief of the machine I'm not in here First of all, I told you that I was a machine recommendation The second look at the machine Buy the machine Play the machine All come to the machine This sentence is a slogan How can I remember what I'm doing Tell you the third sentence The front visual designer is difficult to remember The toy photographer can remember a little bit But the last word is the great man of the same name This word is I think this word is the best word I've ever used in the past two months This word will make people not only remember you But also have a sense of recognition Understand? Can also make you feel recognized And this word I believe it's all me The young people who are tired of buying toys The user of the toy This word is a very I think the most valuable word The great man of the same name It's a complete combination of my personality and interests Finally, I said Le Gao fans But the center feels that the domestic program is getting better and better This is why I'm on the domestic program And I don't want to be a shadow I hope I can learn a high level At the same time, it shows my attitude You buy it All right Like this core gold and gold You can't do anything about it You can only what You can only keep grinding in the process of being a blogger I've been grinding this for about two or three months That's how I got it out So if you want to grind it out quickly How to do it There's actually a very simple way Let's use the chat GPT to generate It can be generated So For example, there's a model This model is Suppose you're a business N year X X X I want to be a small business now I'm a blogger for young women Provide a service Want to use a sentence to make young women remember themselves Please give me ten or twenty sentences You can write whatever you want Each sentence is limited to 15 words And then this sentence He can also introduce a good thing This is what I did two days ago What I did at the time was that I'm a mouth-to-mouth doctor now I hope to provide mouth-to-mouth service for young women So please use a word to help me write a word so that you can remember me He introduced two words I think it's not bad You can take a look at it So he wrote a lot of ten sentences out of these two words Beautiful girl mouth-to-mouth nurse And then he finally I think two words are not bad What? Mouth-to-mouth nurse and a pig as a pearl I think these two words are fine In short You can make him keep generating the word meeting What are you constantly generating Hundreds of thousands of words Anyway, it's not expensive Right Let him You can grab a few more core words You just need to brush it out You'll make a profit As long as you can brush it out You'll make a profit Understand? Let's give it a try OK All right so Let's try it Not sure I talk to And this thing is really not necessarily able to test it out Maybe I found it out last time But I can't do the test again You got it How do you feel about the previous days At this point, everything is a randomness Open our consulate Osorry This this thiscando Sirz Sometimes others haveitches Let's make it a little bit slower.

你看这个写作起航 我把它稍微跟大家复制一下 我这个写作起航不错啊 然后呢 行云写作如行云流水 这个词也不错啊 然后呢 阅读书写 这个也还可以 语文教育让心塑造这一般哈 文字魔法师 我觉得这还行吧 点燃孩子创作激情 这句话不错 文字之光照亮孩子写成长道路 我觉得这句话完整不错啊 一字一句 这个还可以啊 一字一句写书写孩子辉煌未来 这个不错 文字翅膀助力孩子展翅高飞 语言艺术 后面就有点扯啊 为孩子描绘精彩人生 培养写作让孩子的学业更加立成楼啊 打造写作高手为孩子书写成功篇章 哎 我觉得这个饿食这个词啊 它虽然有点土 但这种刚好是属于家长喜欢的 对不对啊 打造写作高手为孩子书写成功篇章啊 这个虽然土 但家长应该是喜欢的啊 我们再看一下哈 孩子腾飞文在飞扬语文奇迹文字翅膀阅读书写写作大师 我的这第三吧 它比较直接 好前面再看啊 一生所爱 文字翅膀助孩子高飞 对吧 你看啊 起码哎 你是能得到一些词的 这些词还是有些不错的 对吧 然后你就不断不断的附用不断不断换角度去写 你总是能够测出来一个啊 这个就是通过数学跟逻辑通过这种这什么这个叫呃穷举的方式哎对吧 数学里面有个通常叫穷举法对吧 你写那么一千个词让他回答一千遍总有那么几个词是OK的买吗 总有几个词是能够推出来的哎 这个就是核心金句亮点用车的纸笔去写非常适合好吧啊 我们再往下讲 好了哈 那么这个就是简洁的四要数哈 首先第一告诉大家是谁第二什么特点第三什么价值第四你需要一个亮眼的金句其实这里面四段话就是为了将这个亮眼的金句把它亮出来亮出来之后就对了好吧 那么 就讲的快一点哈 账号背景图呢啊这个东西其实还是要讲一下但他不是很重要啊就是做背景图这个东西呢就是呃第一哈他其实就是为了体验真实比方说你是一个医生啊你在账号背景图里面放一些这个呃你穿这个医疗大褂啊这个在什么呃什么医疗的什么各种各样的分享会下会里面拍照的照片包括像一些啊比如说我当时做了一个职场教育号哈我当做教学什么阿泽聊职场啊这账号已经注销了你搜不到的然后呢为了做一个职场教育号哈我当做了教学什么阿泽聊职场啊这账号已经注销了你搜不到的然后呢为了做一个职场教育号哈我当 展示我在这个名气业界的名气我放了一个我当时线下演讲然后呢我站C位的一张图然后这张图呢后面都是大概有二三十个大学生他的气场就很足啊所以这种就很符合我的认识定位 包括第二种的突出利益就是如果说你想引流比方说想引流到私域像托布花他就很直接的啊直接在这个背景图里面放上警大字关注加私信即可领取密集啊 嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯 包括包括這本書的這個什麼樣子放出來這叫權威證明包括拿到什麼獎啊有什麼名人合影之類的最後一種啊你可以放自己自拍啊但這個自拍呢 呃像我哈我放這個自拍是專門我這個人像的自拍啊為什麼呢因為 我的頭像是一個ai生成的嘛對吧我的頭像是ai生成的然後呢 其實ai生成的圖雖然好但他畢竟跟真人還是有點差距但是我又不想露臉 那麼這個時候呢我就放了一張就是我戴了口罩我覺得長得還行啊拍的還行那張照片同時我的背景是一個 當時買了很多積木的一個合照就一堆積木的一個合照然後這樣照片呢 真人出鏡放出來之後呢是為了提升黏性對吧你也可以放一些你的這個比較有意思的生活照對吧跟孩子跟家庭的合照都可以 主要就是為了提升你人性化的一面拍高粉絲的黏性 好吧我選的原因就是嘛 因為我的頭像是ai 所以我希望通過背景去提高我的黏性但我又不希望我的頭像做真人 因為我真人頭像放這種就很普 放這種就很普對不對很樸素但是如果說我的背景圖放這個就還有點意思 但是如果說我頭像放我的這個真人的這個圖就會比較樸素就會比較樸素好吧 好了 那麼 這個是關於好的背景圖哈這個東西講的比較快大家自己回去看 最後一個什麼呢最後一個是 你需要最關鍵很重要哈 最後講這東西其實就是兩句話但是你要營造好自己的歷史筆記 我說了 你的報款筆記來臨之前這個時候很重要就是你的第一條報款筆記來臨之前很重要這個時間為什麼 因為 這些之前店的內容 你如果發的好並且他用戶他最後報款筆記來了 他看你的賬號他就有東西了 其實可以看 對你這關注率就會往上走但如果你人生第一條筆記就爆了其實那條的漲粉率是不高的 我跟大家說一句實在話你們知道嗎我就是屬於那種人生第一條筆記就是我第一個賬號第二筆就爆了的那種 你們看到我現在這個筆記的平次不是說我刪過的 我真的就是第一條就三千在我真的是第一條就三四千個在對吧不是我吹牛逼但是那第一條三四千個在給我漲的份好像我記得沒記錯應該只漲了三百 只漲了三百個粉絲 三千個在但我只漲了三百個粉絲這個數據 是我遠低於我現在兩到三個在一個份的 是遠低於我現在的爆款筆記三到五個在一個份的 為什麼早期是十個在二十個在一個份因為很簡單 我當時已經將我的頭像什麼那些我都已經設計好了但是就是因為我沒有歷史筆記 用戶看完就會懷疑我後面能不能持續生產出類似的內容 他們對我的關注率就馬上減半折損一半了 所以我一般建議大家 因為有爆款筆記之前你一定需要有那麼十到十條東西先墊著 這個就是歷史筆記歷史筆記的數據它可以不好它真的可以不好 但是你的封面視覺內容一定要統一統一到 你這一條跟你最新爆款那一條是大差不差的 同時賬號一定不能空一定要統一的歷史筆記墊著並且是垂直的門類對吧 色調統一文字風格統一語言風格有統一的歷史筆記內容指機電 我說了並且這個歷史筆記你必須是同一個門類同一個賽道的你不能前面的十條裡面你發了一條積木的火但你前面的實在裡面 兩條探店兩條旅遊兩條家庭的合照還有一條什麼一條你上上雅思托夫班的什麼照片 是不行的是不行的這種還等於你能把它們全部刪掉一定要是統一的類似的內容的歷史筆記基點 並且 文字風格語言風格是同一的同一的明白嗎啊 然後另外 同時當你發到二十條內容以後你就可以置頂了 當你發了大於二十條內容之後就可以置頂了置頂的東西置頂兩條第一條是你最爆款的筆記 用戶會點擊置頂看你最爆款最受歡迎的筆記一般來講最爆款最受歡迎的就是在大多數人認為 乾貨跟價值最高的 這種東西你們很客觀嘛你就這樣最爆款置頂就好了啊然後第二第二很重要第二條置頂一定是你最利人設的視頻 什麼是利人設的視頻很簡單就是講故事 或者說是你的願景你的情懷你做這事情的意義啊是什麼那麼你們看我的置頂筆記就很典型對吧我給你們看哈 我先打開我的小黃書主頁 點擊我的主頁這裡面手裡的兩條就是我置頂的兩條這一條啊這一條是一點一萬讚長的一個筆記 是我目前當時做到裡面就是數據最好的一條我放過來就讓大家看完就覺得嗯這東西還是不錯的還是不錯的啊 讓他們收獲的概率最大 啊 有哪些在拍案上的街景產品有哪些在設計上甚至能超越樂高的寶藏品牌先跟大家介紹四個國產 對吧這就是這一條這條已經是公認數據最好的了那我就放過來好那麼歷史的封面不同要重新發嗎 如果可以的話你不用重新發重新發幹嘛呢你你把你點擊編輯點擊編輯之後呢直接修改修改封面就行了修改封面哈修改封面好那麼第二條 第二條置頂我發的是一個數據比較 一般的只有600個在啊屬於我這裡面中等偏上不是最好的數據 為什麼我放個600在原因很簡單這一條是為了抬高漲粉率的這一條是為了抬高漲粉率的前面我做的是清單的清單的推薦但我這一條 講什麼呢我這一條講的是我做這事情的意義然後這條你們需要看完我向大家看完哈 你好這也是經過日記這是我做的第五十天 感謝各位的太愛了啊 平台的支持 馬上一萬分 為什麼改不了這個機會想和大家是不是改不了封面嗎第一個問題你是不是咋了手條 周永明經常推國產積木的博主評論區會有人經常問你恰到多少飯這樣為國產積木說話你良心大大的壞 錢確實沒恰到但是買積木拍視頻自己倒是貼了好幾萬 坦白的講就算我這個賬號粉絲再增長下去到了十萬幾十甚至上百萬幾乎也恰不了多少飯某國產積木的品牌負責人跟我講 他說就算比我粉絲多那麼 幾倍幾十倍甚至上百倍的知名大號他們也都是以產品質量合作為主我們作為博主 愛繪畫怎麼立人設我一個國產積木都能夠立人設你愛繪畫不能立人設嗎啊你愛繪畫 你也可以說你做愛繪畫不是為了錢啊是為了什麼是為了普及AI幫助普通人更快的掌握AI希望幫助大家不要懼怕AI 你這個人設價值是不是就上來了我一個賣貨的博主都能立人設 啊你愛繪畫還能立人設嗎真的是吃的其實是品牌推廣的預算你先把這個看完好了 算了多少來一定要看完的利潤但是國產積木的利潤大家可以隨便去任何購物的平均去搜索樂高的單個零件價格在於八毛到一塊 多數關閉的金融的價格只能到樂高的十分之一都在一毛左右都是走量生產銷售賺取微博利潤 從廠家的角度上考慮這點微博的利潤給博主還不如攢一攢拿去買ip 版權一旦品牌給出了ip版權的授權費用相當於就花了大量的錢去拓展市場剩下的錢還要做研發生產銷售的成本 更不會有廣告預算給我們這些博主的一分錢都沒有當然會有小可愛說 那你拿了吃壞的產品套裝可以去某一賣掉積木這個東西的價值他就是在平台的六歲上 我拿到吃壞商品為了拍視頻拼都拼好了還怎麼專手賣掉同時越是大的套裝拼起來越花時間越佔地方 所以最終 水平的家裡房子的面積 第二個問題我是怎麼看待國產金木的未來我有一個不同的觀點可以放出來跟大家探討 我認為現在志願觀覽金木發展的並不是拼搭手感和版權 除了工藝的迭代升級2022年之後生產的國產金木套組主要是國產一線品牌或者使用至高的四年間生產的套裝 拼搭手感都能接近樂高的90% 我曾經找了20個人忙 特高的私領件跟樂高領件這裡面18個人給我的回答是感受不出任何區別只有兩個人明確選擇樂高的版權就更不是志願了說一句可能很多人不認同甚至會生氣的話我認為現在國產金木的IP版權比樂高還多 你可以在國產金木裡面找到各式各樣五花八門的版權如果你喜歡超跑國產金木拿下了帕加尼奧迪二二八 你們先看我有點著急我上廁所了 五分鐘五分鐘 手裝汽車等 其實 如果你喜歡電影電視劇武林外傳愛情工藝等經典電視劇幾乎被關閉經過拿了個便剛上映的大片關的金木可是一個都不會出國 如果你喜歡動漫的哈嘍kitty火影忍者櫻桃小丸子蠟筆小青你只要叫得出名字的日本動漫或者國產動漫我敢說幾乎都在國產金木手裡 你喜歡流行文化你用的表情包插畫頭像都能夠做成過程 說白了ip版權這個事情本質上就是錢的事 對於潮汕老闆來講 坐下來講個爹的事而我認為制約國產金物發展的其實是拼搭體驗跟品牌溢價 因為利潤有限從成本控制的考慮國產金木從拿下一個版權到生產一個套裝立項生產銷售的週期一般不會超過三個月 生產的產品套裝最重要的要求一定是懷孕度要高樣子要好看要精緻這樣才能賣得出去搭建的樣子足夠好看 剩下就是調整步驟分幾個零件包C2這個軟件全自動導出說明書就能夠生產銷售 所以國產金木在結構上往往有很多不合理的拼搭方式說明書製作的也很粗糙 所以很多小夥伴購買國產金木的體驗經常就是你洗滋滋的買了個大套裝覺得自己佔了個大便宜打開之後看了半天說明書愣是看不懂 印刷的顏色也不是很匹配但是沒辦法只能硬著躲避開始拼 好不容易拼到了一半發現結構上不合理要我拼不上去要問金木一碰就散掉 你認為是自己的問題到處搜索原因 最後 咨詢了一些積木圈裡面的玩家大哥玩家大哥嘆了口氣和你說國產都這樣拿出了一瓶焦水給到 作為對比樂高的idc列從評選出來玩家設計的moc套裝到最終上市銷售週期一般在12個月 這12個月幹嘛呢前6個月好幾個專業的樂高設計師調整moc做的不合理的結構選擇更加合理的拼搭方式 或者乾脆不差錢直接開幕 後面三個月是巧分包分包零件 現在的時候除了按照步驟分好大包的編號之外甚至還要按照零件的規格分為小包讓用戶尋找的體驗更加的好 最後再用三個月的時間預售宣傳才到上市銷售 經過了這12個月的精細打磨才真正到西端客戶手裡用戶的體驗當然不一樣 到處就會有人說了還是樂高好貴有貴的道理 但我在這有個不同的觀點我認為樂高不是因為好才貴而是因為貴才好 樂高平均的零件單價比國產金務貴十倍 因為我們假設有多個十倍有了足夠厚的利潤才能覆蓋得起這麼長的研發設計生產的週期跟成本 因為作品打磨了足夠久所以用戶的體驗也會更好 當然我們可以合理假設如果某天有國產金務品牌也能達到樂高的利潤規模 我認為他做的不會比樂高差甚至會更好會有這樣的一天嗎一定會有的國產金務這種話實在會開放 現在我們看到總組發言 其實我們現在已經看到了有拼其家企未及這樣的國產品牌除了會拿版權之外 也會花更多的精力放在產品的結構質量拼搭體驗跟玩法趣味欣賞 開始有意識傳遞出這個品牌價值給到客戶培養認可自己品牌調情的中式粉絲 而使國產商品追求的事情我們經歷的太多早一點的比如手機你看我把這個視頻的你應該沒有人會在用摸機啊 你看這是個寫作手法 我把國產金務 這個事兒啊他覺醒上升到國家啊國家高度層面 近一點的比如新能源汽車以前只會加價不可一世的豐田本田現在都已經開始降價促銷送ipad 並不是某個品牌某個商品某個人的功能 背後都是中國國裡的崛起國產金務可以崛起嗎一定可以的 這不是可能而是歷史的必然第三個問題國產金務能超越樂高嗎 我這兩天去的深圳會談中 新的一個國產金務玩具展別誤會展會上沒有長腿模特兒漂亮小姐姐就一群戴著眼睛頭髮系數或者拉他的朝廠大哥 就有人過去他們就問朝廠口音有如出一轍的話向你介紹你知不知道我們品牌不知道沒關係我們是中國金務啦 當你和國產金務品牌有過接觸你就會發現這個行業裡的每一個人都充滿了信任 無論是銷售研發事業家生產車的那幾層工人他們都會有種使命感 他們手中的這一份 事業不是某個金務品牌也不是某個玩具公司而是統一都覺得期待著的是中國金務中國金務能超越樂高嗎 就流量地球二種免許才是我信我的孩子會行我孩子的孩子會行最後一箱中國金務點個讚 我現在跟你們說句實在哈哈 我覺得上次彭小寶看完之後他他他微信私信我這個老師哎你這個 你說你置頂說你不賺錢 啊但是你朋友說天天說你賺錢你到底賺不賺錢啊他當時有這樣的一個疑問我這麼跟你講 你們關注我是叫我叫洛家啊但是呢我在公寓的女生叫積木日記 那麼我為什麼要發一個這樣的一個視頻為什麼要說我自己不賺錢很簡單就是為了利人壽要有人說最後總是要上價值對啊你可能覺得最後總是要上價值是很套路 但我跟你們講實際他的收益 我們就打開我的小紅書後台好不好啊文大實在的去看他的收益是什麼樣的 好啊 我跟你們講 我這麼多筆記裡面我只有一條我只有一條筆記是能夠單換的就是一個在一個粉一個在一個甚至一個在能長兩個分是哪一條的就是我置頂那一條 看到沒有 多數的筆記是什麼你看點贊90長粉33啊然後呢點在28長粉8然後呢你看啊有一些啊 點贊1000長粉295 是不基本上三到五個在一個分三到五個在一個分啊這已經是我目前是一個成型的經過主之後三到五個站場一個分但是我只有那一條置頂的筆記 嗯 嗯 我翻一下 看到沒有 就這一條600個在長800個分600個在長800個分 並且這個數據他的統計還是不完整的這個數據統計的是不完整的 他為什麼是能做到600個在長800個分是1比1.2 1.3的一個單反單換很簡單就一件事 當我的賬號你們是能夠感受到的對不對當我的用戶來到我的這個主頁他看到我的內容 首先先看了一下我大多數的一個平均比較看先看一下我的主頁好他講的是跟積木相關的內容 然後這個時候看我的主頁置頂先看的是我最爆的那一條下一步他覺得好啊這個人推薦的東西還可以但是你們知道嗎 如果一個人發了東西他都是太過於統一的比方說很多 很多人做推薦他推薦了推薦的越到後面他越像個機器人 用戶很奇怪的他希望的東西有用但他又不希望的東西只是有用他希望更高層面的對你的認可是你是一個活生生的一個人 如何認可你是一個活生生的一個人就是你現在站出來告訴他我其實有故事我其實有夢想我其實有願景 那麼我這個積木的賬號我總不能告訴他我的故事過去的成長的這個這個曲折故事對不對 那我肯定告訴他的是我的願景和夢想那麼為什麼我要寫這一條國產積木能超越樂高嗎 因為這一條東西他能夠上架只能夠把我的願景和夢想告訴給他們這一條一發出來 當時那一天他數據不好可能就一兩百個在但是我就馬上漲了三四百個粉絲我知道就賺了 因為很多用戶是在我的在我的什麼在我的主頁猶豫但是現在你告訴我其實你是一個很有意思的一個人 你是一個有夢想有堅持一個人那麼這個時候我被你 弄到了我會關注你明白了嗎而且就是這一份感動 反而能夠讓你跟一群積木博主一群類似的博主這裡面突出的出來 你是一個能夠讓我感覺到你是一個活生生有溫度的這個人你給我的價值夢想讓我感受到你是一個人的時候 他會更加願意關注你 明白了嗎我這一段說的是比較的籠統但是我希望大家好好去理解啊 你可以認為啊不然吧不是賣情懷 但是你可以 賣情懷真的挺香的真的挺香的有用的東西好吧 我們這我們的課程不探討他的東西是好還是壞我們只告訴你這東西有用 我現在實打實告訴你賣情懷對立人設有用你做還是不做這個東西你們自己去考慮好吧 我作為老師只能給你們建議只能給你們我覺得是正確的道路但你們做還是不做你們自己決定同樣的 這一類的內容除了像我這樣上價值之外還有能夠什麼樣 等一下稍等我找一下我的xmine 好首先哈 這是第一種叫我做這個賬號的意義那麼第二種是什麼呢你的成長經歷在社會上摸爬滾打的經歷 忠誠大事你幹哪些別人不敢幹的稀罕事 你們有看過 一個一種視頻嗎 叫什麼叫做一個不服輸的女生的十年 你看這種類似的視頻嗎 什麼一個不服輸的男生的十年一個不服輸的一個普通女孩的十年有看過嗎有看過的課一有看過嗎看過的課一啊有沒有 有看過對不對 你會發現 當這個內容對吧好多對不對他們為什麼這麼做呢他們為什麼這麼做你們現在告訴我答案是什麼他們為什麼做這個事情 好吧 你知道當時這個視頻開始火了之後哈其實到現在為止他也是火了 很多什麼美妝的英語的母音博主甚至數碼博主啊甚至還有些ppt博主他都會做一個一個不服輸巴拉巴拉的十年 他們為什麼幹這個事啊 都是在賣考研課什麼不是不是的很多美妝啊很多各種當禮物他們都在做這個事他們都在做這個事 他們為什麼 為什麼去幹這個事呢好吧我剛剛講了這麼多 為什麼他們要做一個我的十年這樣的視頻啊評論區能不能說 你能不能說一下哈 你會發現很多賬號它的置頂就是我的十年一個普通女生的十年他們為什麼幹這樣的事啊 現在你們應該懂了吧現在你應該懂了吧 有沒有啊他們為什麼要做一個我的十年啊 讓人覺得很厲害他學習啊 不是的啊厲害可能也是一個方面吧 其實最重要什麼最重要就是讓用戶覺得你是一個人你是一個人你知道嗎 當一個美妝博主他的粉絲他的數據都很薄啊他的每一條筆都很好 其實你會發現他彷彿他就應該高高在上他彷彿他就應該厲害 但現在他反過頭來告訴你其實當年我也貧困過當年我也是個很貧窮的博主當年我也很普通 這個時候他是不是馬上就拉高拉低了跟你的距離感 他會變得更加的形象變得更加親民 更像一個普通人 好 那麼 我們現在哈 另外是什麼 包括還有另外一種哈這種就是比較獨特的東西真的很牛皮哈這個真的很牛皮哈 這是一個清華的一個博主啊這是一個清華美術學院的一個博主叫胡子爸爸他做了一件事 45歲去留學倫敦的皇家藝術學院然後帶著孩子去國外去讀那個 啊去學美術藝術 去學藝術那麼 這種就是這種什麼這種就是很典型的別人幹了一些別人不敢幹的稀缺事並且在40多歲的這種偏中年的一個年齡 幹了一個什麼幹了一個很離譜的一個事他也是為了拉近人設而且是他第一條視頻 他這條視頻獲得了5000多個在第一條裸發5000個在很牛逼很牛逼啊你們自己去看一下 而另外的什麼呢另外的是這是一個北大的一個博主教語文的啊 他其實從小到大啊他成績都很好啊但他說了啊他想成績很差哎這條視頻裡面說了是他想成績很差 是媽媽啊靠了這個99%媽媽教育我然後我逆襲上了美大啊 這種東西鬼話啊我了解這個博主這個博主從小到大成績都非常好就沒有成績不好的那一刻啊但他為什麼寫這一段狗血的故事呢 就是為了利人設啊 某種意義上用反差感博眼球這個這個東西呢 個人不喜歡這麼說啊我覺得呢這樣的評論顯得太過於業餘了啊但是我覺得你這麼說他也沒錯只是呢我們現在要通過客觀的方式去評價 這個用反差感博眼球他的東西的意義是什麼這也是為什麼我要上這麼一節課我希望大家現在用的是一個偏系統性的方式去思考 他們為什麼幹這個事很簡單因為能夠抬高長粉率就核心的一個詞能夠抬高長粉率 利下了他更加像人的一個人生他的整個角色讓他整個人設變得更加豐滿然後讓他長粉率變得更高 好了你賣了嗎 那麼 以上就是我們今天課程的所有內容啊還不錯啊一個小的四十分鐘講完了啊我們以後爭取就這麼一個節奏好吧那麼今天晚上內容先到這啊 大家如果覺得 學到了在評論區敲一波溜溜好吧 那麼今天感謝大家的參與啊那我們後天再上課吧拜拜拜拜啊早點休息再見",

    "data": " Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. It's very easy to get stuck. Many bloggers I know, like the one in Yasheng, they do it with their passion. They don't need to say how many fans they have. Maybe they get stuck with one or two thousand fans. They don't know what to post. At the same time, they feel very confused. So in the Mungya period, everyone just needs to sort out their own positioning. Including the one we just mentioned, your online mode, your content, your clear track record, and your confirmed users. That's when it's okay. I'm sure after 21 days of learning, you will be able to get over 80% of the people. Now we are entering the second stage, which is the exploration period. Usually, the exploration period is between 0 and 20,000 fans. What are you doing in this stage? You are initially verifying the market. You are initially interacting with the market and establishing your own network. Including the awareness of the users' preferences. What content do they like? What should I do with the cover? What should I write about the title? The users will be willing to click on it, right? At this stage, you will constantly try and wait to find the content that you are more advantageous about. You know which content is better, which content is better. You can easily make your own content. Users will enjoy it. Right? So, in this exploration period of 0 to 20,000 fans, you must create your own content. So, do you remember what we asked you to do before? We planned our own content selection series, right? Then I told you to make dynamic adjustments. In fact, the adjustment stage is our exploration period. You have to keep doing content in different directions. Then you have to look at it. Which content is your advantage? Then you copy it and do it in three. Make this your B, your When your exploration period goes smoothly, you will enter the growth period. So, this is the core competitiveness. I mean, if it goes smoothly, if you are in the exploration period, it's not so smooth. Your time cycle may be a little longer. Then at the same time, some people may be stuck in this exploration period. So we will also see in the novel, no matter if there are a lot of bloggers, right? He grows very slow. He may be 10,000 fans a few months ago, half a year ago. You see after half a year, he still hasn't broken 20,000 fans, right? Then he is actually in the exploration period. He didn't find the points we just talked about. Then he will be stuck in this stage. So if it goes smoothly, he will go through the growth period. In the growth period, you will have this obvious data growth. It may be from 50,000 to 100,000. But this data is only for reference. Everyone probably knows what this means. Because this is an average value. It must be different. The situation of the track is different. For example, some tracks, it is impossible to reach 1 million points at all. right? Some tracks may not reach 50,000 points at all. There will be some small and medium tracks. So you can use this to compare to see which period you are in now. Then it's OK. Then let's take a look at this growth period. The growth period is to produce some burst funds. Need to produce some burst funds. Why? It's at this stage. It's the accumulation of our previous accumulation. The post-production is not issued, right? So at this stage, there should be some preliminary results. Because you actually have a sense of the user and a sense of the network. In fact, at this stage, you need to polish it more precisely to grasp the needs of the user. For example, at this stage, you have to make some predictions. I know what kind of content is sent out. Users will like to see it. I know if this content is sent out, it can be popular. I know what kind of quantity it can reach if this content is sent out. Right? At the same time, because of your basic knowledge, you have already established the basis. You have already published the basic. Right? In fact, you have already mastered the rules and the system of this set of content. Then you just want to establish a difference. Because if you haven't considered establishing a difference at this stage, then it will be difficult for you to break through the limit of this growth period. Because we have been telling you before, that is, this track, including the entire Internet, the new media platform, it is relatively twisted. There are constantly new people coming in. Right? If you don't have this kind of difference, no memory, it is very likely that these fans will soon forget you. He turned his head to another person. Because the audience always needs the latest content. So at this stage, we will have to consider the initial establishment of our differences. Just like what we told you in the first lesson. Right? In the second lesson, I said that the part of content creation is not required in the initial stage. It doesn't matter if it's not in the initial stage, but you have to do some difference-making things as much as possible when you reach this growth stage. That is, we said that the nine palaces of creation, everyone still remembers, right? You can refer to our nine palaces of creation to do an upgrade. Then there is our outbreak period. Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? In that case, it is the period of 200,000 to 500,000 fans. In general, the outbreak period is the process of your fans growing rapidly. Everyone should know that in this process, the number of fans is not growing rapidly. It is possible that you have done it for three months, but only 10,000 fans have grown. But you may be in the fourth month, 50,000, or 100,000 fans have been raised all at once. There is such a possibility. Because doing content creation is a process of post-production. That is, you have put a lot of content in front of you, 用户点进来看了你的主页,对吧? 内容非常丰富,也有很多内容符合我的需求, 那我就会关注它。 但是你如果作为一个信号, 用户它是没有那种确定性的, 所以它就不太那么容易转粉。 所以其实它本身就是一个积累的过程。 那在爆发期的时候, 你的内容风格调性可能会逐渐趋于稳定, 然后同时也会积累到一定数量的铁粉。 那这个时候需要去做的就是不断的去放大你的差异化, 然后更丰满更立体的人设。 所以你会看到那些就是活得比较久的那种IP, 比如说我以前是做微博的, 然后后面发现小文书火了, 我又做小文书, 我又做抖音,对吧? 这种IP它能跨越这种时间周期, 大家还记得哈? 是因为什么? 是因为它有IP有人设,对吧? 它有足够的差异化, 它有很多的铁粉, 所以它其实是有新的平台出来, 还带着粉丝迁移到新的平台就OK了,对吧? 而且你会发现大凡是没有这些东西的, 这些博主它都消失在了这个历史的长河当中。 就是比如说这个每个平台都会有很多很多的博主, 可能过一段时间它就消失在历史了,对吧? 嗯。 所以这个是爆发期。 那爆发期过了以后就进入到了成熟期, 成熟期的话就是已经有相对稳定的风格了, 同时沉淀了有比较多有黏性的铁粉。 但是另一方面呢, 就是用户它的新鲜感是上市了, 因为你做了很久了, 一直都在发那些内容,对吧? 它可能就是用户的新鲜感会上市, 同时可能就会发现了一些新鲜感, 同时可能就会发现了一些新鲜感, 同时可能就会发现了一些新鲜感, 同时可能就会发现了一些新鲜感, 然后就会伴随着有一些掉粉。 前面会不会有掉粉呢? 有,但是总体来说, 它的增长是大于这个下降的,对吧? 那在成熟期有可能就会这个下降大于你的增长, 也就是你的长粉改不上掉粉。 这个也是一个必经阶段, 大家可以看到, 所以就是博主他其实还是需要就是, 有适度的一些突破和转型。 包括, In the past, those who posted a lot of funny videos on TikTok, they would also get a lot of hate comments. Like Duoyu and Maomao, they got a lot of hate comments. And then, they did a live broadcast, because the cleaning lady in the epidemic cooperated with them and let them enter the second phase. So, in fact, when the period is mature, it's best to make some early arrangements. You might see that the period of my decline is coming, so I have to take the initiative to find a new growth curve. This is a stage of growth for the small book blogger. Or it should be said that it is a stage of growth for the IAP. We know about this stage, so we can actually know what stage we are in right now. What is my focus? At the same time, I don't have to worry about what I haven't done yet, because I know that it is my goal to achieve in the next cycle. So, we will do it in stages, one stage after another. And then, didn't I just tell you about the different stages? In fact, every stage will encounter a bottleneck. You can't break through, so you are stuck here. You can't get into the next stage. So, if you are stuck in this place, you can't move much or the speed is too slow, we call it a bottleneck. So, what are the performance of the bottleneck? The first performance of the bottleneck is that the growth is too slow. What is this slow? This slow is not about the time when you just started the previous period, the slow growth. The slow growth is normal when you just started the previous period. This slow growth is about the follow-up. For example, your growth rate is obviously lower than the previous one. For example, my growth rate in September is obviously worse than in August. That's what I mean. So, in this period, if you encounter this bottleneck, what are the possible problems? The first one is that your positioning and personality may not be clear. Growth is actually strongly related to positioning and personality. Why do others pay attention to you? For example, if you are a mess, you share everything. It's hard for you to grow up. So, on the surface, growth is just a number. In fact, behind the scenes, you need to think about why others pay attention to you. The core will go back to whether our positioning and personality is clear. The account difference is not obvious. Is your content consistent? So, in fact, the user's concern for you is the certainty. If at some stage, your growth rate is slow, you can look back and see what caused it. The second one is that there is little interaction. What does it mean by little interaction? It means that your fans are very sticky. You may post a post, but basically no one is interacting with you. This means that there is little interaction. Then, it may be that your content is not bought. The user does not know what to do to interact with you. There is another situation. Is the user's stickyness in front of you good? If you have some sweetness, they will interact with you. So, in this situation, you need to think about these two aspects. The third one is that there is no search. You may encounter this. There are some content I post, and there are quite a lot of small eyes. But why is it that there is less like and search? Right? Maybe there is no search because your content is not enough. If there is less like and search, it is actually what we said before. Your content is not enough. You do not understand the needs of the users. So, you did not hit the point. They will not give you a thumbs up. Then, there is less transformation. Less transformation means that the positioning and content are too far from the market needs. It is the track you made. Maybe you did not think clearly about how to transform in advance. Then, you just know to do the content with a head. Do it, do it, do it. But you still cannot transform. Because it is too far from the market. The users do not know how to transform the product you have. Right? And maybe the product you made or the content you made will not make the users think about the product they need. So, this is usually what you will encounter when you transform the product. So, when we talked about the class on the parallel, we will also let you use this model of the loophole with millions of prices, right? To sort out your parallel products. Then, there is less output. Less output means that there is no new motivation recently. The main thing is that the feedback is relatively low. Maybe it is because it has been released recently, and there are no likes, no comments, no attention, right? Maybe there is no motivation to follow up. But you have to think about it. When you send a note, and it can give you, for example, tens of thousands of dollars, how can you not have the output? Right? So, when the feedback is relatively low, this may happen. It will break the roots, or something like that. But in the early stage, I still have something to say to you. In the early stage, you have to be able to stand the loneliness. In the early stage, it is impossible to have positive feedback as soon as you do it. Because this is a business. If you want to start a business, you can start it today, and you will earn a lot tomorrow. It is not realistic, right? So, I think in the early stage, you still have to be able to stand the loneliness. So, in the parallel stage, more or less, we will definitely feel anxious. Because no matter what the problem is, it may affect your whole content, and your IP, it is quite a big impact. So, it is inevitable, it will bring us some anxiety. This kind of anxiety is actually what I just said. This kind of timely feedback causes your data anxiety. Actually, there is this, I told you before, it is actually better to change the line of action. It is more anxious to change the line of action. If your recent data is not good, it will directly affect your advertising, directly affect your income. This kind of anxiety will actually be a little bigger. In fact, the active line of action will be much better. So, don't put the egg in one basket. Because indeed, many bloggers, many bloggers have this data anxiety. Let me show you. Let me show you. These are all your previous students. This one on the left is a blogger with about 20,000 fans. This one on the right is a blogger with about 600,000 fans. Their anxiety is almost the same. So, when they encounter these bottlenecks, they will also come to me to talk. Like, do some psychological massage, or something like that. So, I also understand more about most of the psychological cards, and what they are all about. And then, I also specially posted a post. This is a blogger who has been doing this for a long time. Look at him. He has been doing this for more than three years. A blogger like this. And then he wrote a post. He wrote it in the early morning. Some of the thoughts of being a blogger for three years at 1 a.m. You can take a look. I won't read it to you. But I will read it to you. And then, when you sit down, you will find that he has lost his desire to share. That is the card point I just mentioned. The card point with less output. And then he feels unhappy. This is actually when he encounters a bottleneck. So, everyone just look at this matter more broadly. You will encounter more or less. It is impossible for you to say that you are not anxious at all. It is impossible. So, this is a process of cultivation. It is possible to teach. It is possible to be anxious. But do not continue to be anxious. I can allow myself to be anxious. But do not go beyond how long. In fact, for myself, I am a highly sensitive person. So, I used to be the kind of person who is particularly easy to be anxious. And then I will be in that anxiety. Maybe I will be in a state of state of mind for a whole day. I can't do anything. It may last for another two days. But then I used a lot of methods. And then I can identify my own anxiety emotions in the moment. And then I will think of some ways to solve it. You may be anxious for a while. You can be anxious. You still have to do what you should do, right? For example, you can read a book. And then write down your own emotions or something. You can try to use more methods. Anyway, I think anxiety is okay. But it is not necessary to continue to be anxious. It is true that it is already very serious. It will affect your life. I just think it is not necessary. Okay. So, I just told you about some of the things that we may encounter. I want to ask everyone, are you worried about your period? If you are worried, give me a 1. If you are not worried, give me a 2. Let me see how many students are left. Are you worried about your period? Yes. Or are you worried about your picot? What about the occasionally flow of money? Why? Tell me how are you trying to eat? The Pittans don't eat anything together. I see there is a student who eats something as such on a period. So, did you eat too much because your colleagues made you on the period instead of the time when your 교육 soup is ready and I want to cover your tummy a little? Did shebringen the student who入 flame That was said just already, You'll be worried after you've passed the exploration period. I understand a lot of things, but there's still a gap in my mind. Are you sure? I'm sure. So this is a process of self-practicing, of learning to be a practitioner. In life, you'll definitely encounter various things. Except for the anxiety caused by doing this, there will definitely be many other things that will make you anxious. So I think you still have to learn how to deal with anxiety. About data anxiety, I want to share a little bit with you. There's a saying that goes, there's no open period without a calm period in life. I have a special feeling about this. Every time I encounter some low-level issues, I will grow a lot of new things. There are new strengths, new ideas, new methods. Anyway, there are a lot of things that grow out of the crisis. So I really want to share this with you. There's no open period without a calm period in life. Okay, so we know about data anxiety. We know we're in data anxiety. We know we're in a calm period. So we actually have to find out where the source of data anxiety is, right? Otherwise, you can't solve it. That is, you have to solve why I'm anxious. Why am I anxious? On the surface, it's because of the data. But what's behind the data? What does the data mean? Usually, there are several sources of data anxiety on this platform. I've listed some of them for you. You can slowly go through them later. The first one is that you have a vague self-identity. In this case, it's because you're anxious. You're anxious because you're anxious. You're anxious because you're anxious. You're anxious because you're anxious. You're anxious because you're anxious. You're anxious because you're anxious. You're anxious because you're unpredictable. You're anxious about what's going to happen next. You're anxious because there is a level of anxiety. You might go for it, right? You might go for it, right? Or maybe more angry because you strange it. I'm anxious because I'm anxious anyway. This also can be a strategic knell, right? Also because you have one side to track what you want to create, and you use it to monitor personal needs and the needs of your customers. So you're going to find a balance between expressions and market needs. you may know what the users want to hear. You can talk to the users and tell them what they like to hear. But at this point, you may not be happy. So the interaction with the outside world has blurred your self-knowledge. Are you still doing what you like? For example, I just showed you this case. He found that the content he was doing gradually may not be what he likes. He said he was posting on Xiaohongzhu at midnight, but he was so happy. He found the passion and desire to express himself. So in this case, you may not be happy. But you may have some. I have received a lot of information from this blog. Or I just follow my own expression, and no one will watch it. Then I will still be anxious because of the data difference. Or I know too well what my users want. Then I will tell them what they want to see, what they like to see. But is this what I want to express? Not necessarily. So at this point, there will be some pull. All the anxiety comes from not being confident. So I will not be happy. All the anxiety comes from not being confident. When you are confident, you will not have so many worries and anxiety. So in this case, first of all, you have to agree. You have to agree with the content of your output. At the same time, you have to monitor the needs of the entire market or the users. But the premise is that you have to be happy with it. If you feel like you are being forced to do something, to do something that is in line with the needs of the users, you will definitely be unhappy. So this is the first point. The second point is that the market perception is more vague. Generally, people who live in their own world may express their own thoughts and feelings completely according to their own ideas. Then I will not go to the market or the users. In this case, there will also be problems. You may receive less feedback on the transformation. Because there is no maintenance at the user demand level. So there may be less feedback on the transformation. Then there will be anxiety. Then everyone knows the root, right? Then let's take a look at this. If you encounter data anxiety, what will your performance be like? It's like we jump out of the market and look at ourselves from a third-party perspective. Are we in anxiety? What is the performance of this anxiety? Why do these things happen? The first one is that happiness and sadness are completely determined by data content. If the content data is good, it's happy. If it's not good, the whole person's mood is very high. This is completely in this kind of data anxiety. Everyone try not to care too much about this data. I have encountered this, including myself. After the data is sent out, I will brush it every two minutes. I will look at the data and see if it is good or not. No need to send it out. What should I do? If it's not good, I'll post it the next day. If it's completely in this data, and your happiness and sadness are determined by data content, it will be more popular. You will feel that if you keep it like this, it will take a lot of your energy. So people with weak mental strength will be very painful to do this. The second one is to do what you do. Like completing a job. What kind of data will this be? It's like trying to completely separate work and life. I'm thinking about sharing my work. My life is not in the frame. In this case, you will seem to be playing a role. Because what you display on this platform is not the real you. It's just a very small part of you. So you may become a tool person for others. Because you don't have the ability to be a person. You don't have the sense of reality and three-dimensional. So you will find that those good bloggers don't completely separate life and work. Right? They just share on these platforms. Hey, I had a silly thing today. I'm in a relationship today. I'm married today. Something like this. It's not completely separated. Then the third one is to be expressed by data. Dare not express yourself. In order to pay too much attention to the users' preferences. The content that I want to express is getting farther and farther away from me. More and more lost. Maybe you really want to do a certain type of content. But because the data is not good, I gave up. What I want to tell you here is that there are some deep content. There are some deep content. He will definitely encounter bad data. Because he is more in depth. Most people may not understand. So he must be deep. He is very small. But it doesn't mean he has no value. Because there are always those who can reach the same level of your thoughts. Or people who can understand and understand. And I think your thoughts are very high. And then I'm willing to trust you and follow you. Right? So if you really want to do some of your favorite content. I still I really encourage you to do it. Just don't be kidnapped by this data. I'm sharing it with you. In fact, it's all me. I've been in touch with these bloggers. I'm going to encounter some problems. Although I'm telling you now. Maybe it's early in the morning. But I don't know when you'll meet. Right? If you meet one day, you'll look back. The fourth is that you dare not try. Dare not be late. This is like you are doing a certain type of content now. It's all done in the comfort zone. It's also very comfortable. It's also very simple. Then you actually dare not be late. Because you're afraid of being late. What if the data is not good? Right? The data is not as good as the previous data. So in this case, it will be a step ahead. The fifth is that there is no output inspiration. Lack of creativity. There is no more content inspiration. The author is not satisfied with the content. This is the content that should be expanded. Expand your own communication. Then the eye contact. Expand these. Let this energy flow. Let knowledge flow. Don't be self-conceited. So there are a lot of bloggers. Especially the whole-time bloggers. There will be this kind of situation. Because he has no social media. No work. Being a blogger is his whole job. He is bored at home creating content every day. Really. I think this kind of situation is really very easy to encounter. So you have to go out more. Go out more. Get in touch with more people. Then there will be more mental conflicts. Will this kind of thought flow up? Then the sixth is that you can't help but compare with the same track. Then deny yourself. This will appear. This is the first. What will this kind of thing appear? So when you look for a target account, In fact, it is breaking this point. Many people may not understand. He came up and found it. He started with a four-to-two-thousand-pounds. Three to five hundred thousand pounds of these bloggers to target. Then look at it. People do so well. I'm not compared to anyone. Then you will be in a state of denying yourself. In such an emotion. I'm doing this. I can't even reach the toes of others. Forget it. But in fact. It is possible that this blogger. His starting point is even worse than yours. Right? Just don't use your own starting point. To compare the term of others. The seventh type. What is the seventh kind? The seventh kind is to imitate. Various types of money. Lost their own characteristics. I think this is what everyone is in the analysis. I just analyzed some of the money. Then I will apply it. In the process of application. We still have to go back to this. The bottom logic. Think clearly. I hate those. How to copy someone's manuscript on the market. How to wash the manuscript. I hate that kind of. Why? Because you copy, copy, copy. You must be lost in yourself. You don't know what you want to express. So I never let everyone. I have never let anyone borrow someone's manuscript. Right? I never let anyone imitate someone's content. Don't do that. Because it will limit your thoughts. You can learn about someone's structure. Learn about someone's method. Learn how to catch the user. Learn how to do user guidance. Learn how to pre-match these retweets. But you just don't. Don't imitate this content. Right? OK. This is a summary of some data anxiety. Then I will share with you. What can we do in the face of data anxiety? I think there are actually three choices. The first is to force yourself to win in the fierce competition. Some people are like this. To be honest, it's really like this. This kind of person is usually the kind of person who has a higher demand for himself. It's more of a perfectionist. Anyway, I'm a little like this. But I'm much better in the back. It's okay in the short term. But in the long term, I actually feel more tired. More different. So this kind of first class force yourself to win in the competition. It's just that the data keeps repeating itself. And then stick to the end. This kind of anti-anxiety ability is very high. It's just that I don't recommend people to become this kind of person. And then the second kind is to keep yourself quiet and keep yourself. What does this mean? I'm going to compare myself to others appropriately. This comparison is to keep myself motivated. At the same time, this comparison is not because of its comparison. The purpose is not to make yourself anxious. Right? It's actually to make everyone find their own direction of effort. And then look back and see what I'm going to do. Then I'll slowly improve. Right? I'm a day-to-day person. Keep my own passion. And then do some short-term. Maybe not too much feedback. But it's a reason to make yourself comfortable. I think this kind of way is better. It's just that it's more long-term. It's a combination of our... There's a saying. It's called the sense of leniency. The sense of leniency. And then the third kind. The third kind. I think this is also a bit difficult. The third kind is to keep yourself quiet and be yourself for a longer time. Have you noticed that there are people like that in life? He lives very self-aware. He knows himself very well. Live very self-aware. He doesn't care much about what others think. How others evaluate others. How others look at others. He has his own kind of evaluation system. He has a more stable self-evaluation system. He is not easily disturbed by the outside world. This kind of person is usually very strong in the heart. I... I... I usually only see people who have been in the business for a long time. And then experience a lot of alone. And then those who have a calm mind. So... So this is also relatively rare. This kind of person is actually completely in the personal beauty of the self. You will find that no matter how much he lives, many people are very envious of his state. Right? Just feel that he is full of energy. Because he is also very self-absorbed. Right? I don't care how you look at me. I am happy and comfortable myself. Right? I think this is also OK. This kind of person actually really understands the uniqueness of his IP. He has his own evaluation system. He actually doesn't really pay much attention to the outside world. I have seen such a blogger. And he also does a pretty good job. Just focus on becoming a better self. I think the first and third are actually more difficult. So I recommend you to choose the second one. Just make yourself comfortable and grow. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. I am ready for out An enormous level of encouragement and support from my hyper nerd, chegouա�üelinem p sorte Would you like to off-ے just pose this question for me? OK. Ó verbatim ¿Cómo sería las tiroides? So, yes, fødigst esse face  citámus Vi muitos B Fors Prepared consent the needleEL 那 其实更多的还是要从自我出发, 就是只有自己能拯救自己。 那我这里可以给大家几个比较好用的心法, 第一个叫用内容使命破除焦虑, 就是我自己是对这个比较有感触的, 就是有些人他可能真的就是没有那么那么在意前, 就是钱也不能让他去做自己那些不喜欢的事情或者是怎么样, 就是不能让他坚持下去, 但是他是有使命感的, 我就是想要去做一件我觉得很有意义很伟大的事情, 所以如果是这种情况的话, 那其实就是让你热爱的曾经拯救过你的东西去帮助更多的人, 影响更多的人成为更好的人, 达到向晚的生活, 这就构成了你的影响力, 就是是有一些人, 在这样去做的, 就是我是真的会有自己的这个方向和目标的, 而且我是那种能量满满真的是想去影响别人的那种人, 他肯定多半是会有这种情况, 就是我是有我自己的内容使命的, 不然我可能也坚持不下去, 我觉得这个就是我存在的意义, 那想要让个人IP进入政训化, 其实之前我们也讲了很多, 对吧, 想让你的个人IP进入政训化, 首先就是去梳理你的这些经历, 包括我当时给大家说的定位, 对吧, 然后去写出你的内容, 书写你的故事, 然后第三步吸引了用户, 吸引用户之后, 他们可能又会对你更多东西感兴趣, 然后你又去梳理, 又去输出, 对吧, 不断的这样去过, 那其实动起来, 动起来, 是会破除掉大部分的焦虑, 就是与其用那个时间拿来焦虑, 还不如动起来, 就是不断的去跑这个壁滑, 跑起来自然就没有那么焦虑了, 那最后, 最后给大家分享一些保持灵气的小技巧吧, 也就是大家不要把这个事情想得那么痛苦, 就是我以前就是写那个长篇大论的时候, 我老痛苦了, 我写篇文章可能要一两周, 就写很久很久, 然后后面我总算找到了, 就是让自己没有那么痛苦的, 可能一天两天就写出来了, 就是也不用那么拖拖拉拉, 紧到写不出来, 就是我觉得核心还是, 就是不要那么痛苦, 不要那么痛苦, 然后保持灵气, 然后给大家几个小技巧, 第一个是不闭塞的身材内容, 什么意思, 就是这种不闭塞, 就是你可以跟外界有这种知识交流, 交换或者是能量流动, 比如说我去看书, 然后我去跟别人交流, 这个都叫不闭塞, 就是我是打开的, 很开放式的, 就是不是自己一个人闷头在那想逼着自己, 今天一定要写, 写几篇, 然后明天要写几篇, 累不累, 对吧, 然后第二个就是多与同频人交流, 刚刚也说了, 第三个是不停止体验和探索, 其实很多的灵感都来自于, 生活就是当你的这个生活状态比较闭塞的时候, 其实你是很难有一些灵感的, 对吧, 所以就是不要停止体验和探索, 然后提升对生活细节的一些感知度, 比如像很多博主做了一定的时期, 对吧, 就是出去, 就是我们想象中的聚会是不是就好好大好吃饭, 对吧, 但是对于博主来说, 可能就是尤其是很多探店博主, 对吧, 那可能去, 去评价人家的东西好不好吃, 去拍好照片, 写好文案, 就是人家的工作呀, 对吧, 那他就是要去做这件事情, 然后还要去随时去抓取, 就是从生活当中去抓取这个灵感, 然后去写出这些内容, 对吧, 就是他必须要有对生活细节的这种感知度, 然后就是保持看书这些方式去输入, 就是看书啊, 听课啊, 反正都好, 相信大家都是, 就是很上进的人才会来听咱们这个课, 所以当你们真的也遇到其他就是不能解决的一些问题的时候, 肯定也是会用这个学习的态度和方法去解决这些问题。 那换个思路, 一切都将不同, 这个也是最后几句话想给大家去说的, 就是金句金朗吧, 算是。 第一个金句金朗是什么? 就是不要只看单篇笔记的点赞收藏数据, 也要关注曝光量, 曝光量就是什么? 就是我们的那个小眼睛, 因为每一个浏览背后都是一个真实的观众, 也许他就会被你影响, 就是哪怕你只有200个小眼睛, 那说明有200个人看了你写的内容, 对不对? 所以其实这个也是在给你一个展示自己的, 这个机会啊, 就是大家不要去纠结说啊, 我这个一直现在卡在这个里面, 就是很多时候我们其实去换个思路, 很多问题就一个人而解了。 第二个, 第二个金句金朗, 换个方式实现自我价值, 事业不再单一, 同时低成本的探索自己的内心所爱, 有觉知的活着, 过上自己喜欢又能赚钱的日子。 这句话我觉得可能对于趴趴干比较适用, 因为他现在是在这个小红书上面去探索的这个阶段, 我觉得这句话可能对你比较实用, 就是你现在就是在低成本的去探索呀, 探索自己喜欢的, 自己想做的, 那我觉得不管这个事情最后怎么样, 其实它对于你来说都是一笔财富。 然后第三个金句金朗, 用书写的方式记录生活和成长, 呈现真实的自我, 在这个过程当中找到热爱, 找到自己, 让自媒体成为自我成长最好的阵地。 就是你想你会在一个平台上记录下自己所有的生活和成长, 你的一些感悟, 对吧? 它展现的是你这个阶段的整个的历程, 所以我觉得这件事情本身来说还是挺有意义的, 就是选择用文字视频, 或者是什么把这些记录下来, 我觉得等你以后回过头来看, 也会觉得这是一段有价值的时期。 好,持续做,慢慢做,直到被看见。 这个也是我特别想要去跟大家分享的, 就是不要着急, 真的持续做,慢慢做, 直到被看见。 你要相信你总有一天会被看到的,对吧? 试金子总会发光的。 然后第二句, 太用力的人生跑不远。 所以大家去做这个事情也不用想得那么难, 那么焦虑,对吧? 它只是你生活中的一个部分, 希望大家平常心放轻松, 好好地享受生活。 太用力的人生跑不远, 这句话我也是非常有感悟分享给大家。 好,那我们分享的部分就到这里了, 然后我们来看第二个部分, 颁奖仪式。 第二个部分, 想要给大家先看一下咱们整体的这个节目, 积分排名。 之前我们在开课的时候就给大家讲了, 就给大家讲了我们的积分标准, 然后这一次是这三位同学, 以总积分排名前三, 是获得了咱们本期的优秀学员, 分别是第一名是细写, 他的累计积分是30分, 第二名是木颜, 他的累计积分是28分, 然后第三名是, 他的累计积分是26分。 这三位同学其实都是, 大家会知道他们基本上都没有怎么去过课, 对吧? 然后作业也是按时写的, 然后很多次作业也会被评为优秀, 说明他们实是在很认真对待这次学习的, 所以祝贺这三位同学。 那接下来的话, 我们就请这三位同学来给我们分享一下, 来做一个这个获奖感言, 好吧? 来,第一位同学是有请细细。 细细我看一下他在不在。 细细不在的话, 好像在飞机上, 我们就, 我们就先下一位同学吧。 下一位同学的话是沐妍。 沐妍她是比较爱专业, 爱学习的, 就是她执行力也比较强, 就是她之前也经常会问我一些问题, 然后大家都知道她在这个课程期间就已经完成了变现, 最后我也祝愿这个沐妍, 这个商业设计师也能够借势小红书再上一个台阶。 那现在把话筒递给沐妍, 沐妍来给大家去做一个获奖感言。 沐妍开麦吧。 谢谢老师, 谢谢主教, 然后大家一起努力。 好了。 不用这么简单吧。 要不要让我们来做一个沐妍的沐妍? 要不要让我们来做一个沐妍的沐妍? 要不要让我们来做一个沐妍的沐妍? 要不要让我们来做一个沐妍的沐妍? 要不要让我们来做一个沐妍的沐妍? 要不要让费凡来替你发言? 好啊,老师好,同学们好。 我觉得我跟着沐妍挺荣耀的。 我刚才在她发言之前我就已经给她鼓掌了。 确实沐妍她学习很积极, 但是还是离不开老师的这种专业度, 和平时给我们的一些很好的建议啊,课程。 当然我是作为一个学员, 我觉得我一点都不够格。 主要是有沐妍这么优秀的学员, 所以有她顶着,我平时就挺惭愧,挺惭愧。 平时你都没进步吗? 我在听,但是因为我平时确实杂事情比较多, 断断续续吧。 但是我回头我也会把这些课程呢, 再反复的再听几遍,回放。 嗯。 哦。 嗯。 沐妍,说说自己的学习吧。 学习感悟啊,没有很激动吗? 得奖了。 学习感悟,其实我觉得最后三期课讲得很实用, 因为前面可能更多的就是技法嘛,数, 但是后面三期它更多是方向的一些问题, 心态的问题,我觉得挺有感悟的。 然后,嗯,有一个点我觉得可以跟大家再同频一下, 就是我觉得老师讲的产品结构的那个课, 可以值得大家多听一下, 因为其实商品企划这一块在不管是做品牌也好, 做很多也好, 它其实是一个含金量很高的, 一般人都做不了。 但我觉得老师讲的还是很深入的, 还是很,就是,怎么说呢, 就是蛮深刻的,质量蛮高的, 大家可以多听一下, 我觉得会对大家的帮助非常大。 嗯,大概就这些了,谢谢。 OK, 好,那我们祝贺张明言同学啊。 我们下面有请下一位同学, 帕帕甘同学。 帕帕甘同学就是上课很积极哈, 然后,就是,看起来他年龄比较小, 然后也每天就乐呵呵了啊, 挺挺热爱生活的一小伙子啊, 就是,所以最具潜力奖颁给他。 那下面有请张明言同学。 帕帕甘同学,你帕帕甘来发言。 感觉就昨天分享环节吧, 该说的都说了。 然后,还是怎么说呢? 就表达一下你这个激动的心情。 感谢那个方舍和那个康康助教, 也感谢各位同学。 从各位同学这里确实学到了很多 特别优秀的品质, 然后总觉得自己还有很多 就要向各位讯息和承担的地方。 然后在接下来的日子里, 可能更多的就是,怎么说呢? 就还是一样的,就不忘初心嘛。 就既然都决定了要做小伙子, 肯定是保持学习,然后持续分享嘛。 就永远不要丧失被别人看到的这份勇气就行了。 然后基本上就是这么多吧。 好的,谢谢。 好,不要丧失被别人看到的勇气啊, 我觉得这句话非常的好。 就是我们选择去, 去做小伙子, 我们选择自己去站出来做分享, 去发光发热, 就是为了让别人看到,对吧? 好,那我们再有请下一位同学。 下一位同学, 他算是我们本期的一个插班生。 就是他找到我的时候, 就我们这个课已经开了嘛, 然后他也是加入进来, 但是他其实自己还是比较自觉的, 就自己一直在学,在写作业。 就是基本上现在可能好像 是听到第四课还是第五课了啊, 自己还是进度拉得比较快啊, 也是经常也会抓了我问问题啊, 就比较勤学好问的。 包括之前帕帕刚刚有说, 这个肉肉同学坚持日更小红书有激励到他啊, 那所以我们这个最佳新人奖, 颁给了这个肉肉同学。 那下面有请肉肉同学来给大家分享一下, 自己此刻的心情, 以及这个未来的一些规划啊啥的, 可以聊一聊啊。 包括自己的一些学习感受啊什么的, 想要跟大家分享的都可以去说啊。 那肉肉开麦吧。 好的,能听到我的声音啊? 可以可以。 好的,各位同学,各位朋友, 大家晚上好。 有点紧张啊。 没有没有,没有紧张, 因为刚刚就是嗓子有点哑, 然后其实我觉得第一个啊, 就是我觉得遇到方思是在正确的时间, 然后遇到她, 因为就是我不是直接去上方思的课, 然后是我妹跟我买的这个课, 她跟方思的前任时的, 然后呢, 就是我学这个课的时候啊, 我正好处于一个非常迷茫的时期, 就是我日更啊, 我的流量都非常的不好, 是我也不知道怎么办, 也不知道从哪里入手, 也不知道哪里出了问题, 但是这几天就是听方思的课啊, 我觉得真的受益非常的多, 让我学习到了非常多, 这是我之前看过的, 到了盲点, 然后这个是第一点啊, 然后第二点我觉得就是, 这是很重要很重要的一点, 就是拿到课程之前, 一定一定要先调整好自己的心态和状态, 就你一定要给自己定目标, 我的目标是什么呢? 就是每天坚持学习, 在相对短的时间内把课程全部学完, 那这样子我就会有更多的时间去实操, 遇到问题也可以更及时的去跟老师们进行沟通, 因为像我之前的话, 也去学习过一些, 其他的课程, 但是呢, 就是学得懒懒散散, 他们也没有设计像方思这样子的作业呀, 也没有跟得这么紧啊, 然后就很容易学一节课, 后面全部就荒废了, 就没学了, 所以我觉得调整好心态是非常重要的, 然后第三个的话就是, 一定一定要好好写作业, 就像我昨天说的那样, 这个作业是可以直接拿来后面用的, 然后它相当于是我们后面做小红书的一个稿行吧, 好好写作业, 然后第四个的话, 都是有问题一定要及时的去问老师, 老师的目的是为了让我们有所结果, 一定不要去怕麻烦老师, 我相信就是我们的老师都是很愿意我们去问他们的问题的, 然后我觉得还有一句话吧, 就是没有任何事情能够难倒一个自律要强又渴望成功的女人, 勇敢的人先享受世界, 我觉得不管是分享还是去做小红书, 我们都是需要勇气的, 所以说勇敢的人先享受世界, 最后的话跟大家分享两个特别好用的记录笔记的APP, 一个是幕布, 就是那个幕是那个台前幕后的那个幕, 布的话就是我们穿的衣服这个布, 然后第二个的话就是iNote, 一个悬浮的一个记笔记的一个小工具, i就是我的那个i, note就是那个笔记的那个英语啊, 我觉得这两个APP记笔记非常方便, 我们可以边听方子的课, 然后就直接可以边记笔记了, 然后这个就是我最近的一些嗯感想吧, 然后还有就最后一点啊, 我一直都相信心想事成, 只要我们想去做一件事情, 我们就一定能做到, 然后谢谢大家的聆听。 好,非常非常优秀, 非常自律的肉肉同学啊, 我也我也相信哈, 所以你看我这个证书上也写了, 相信你定能在小红书拿到满意的结果啊, 就是我觉得我觉得只要一个人他真的想把这个事情做成, 一定能做出来, 如果他没有做成一定是他不够想, 因为他只要够想他一定会想出各种各样的方法, 去突破当前所遇到的困境啊, 所以也也给大家一起共勉啊, 希望咱们这个同学结束以后哈, 就课程结束以后不要方会啊, 荒废啊, 虽然没有老师天天来鞭策你们啊, 这个作业写了吗, 课听完了吗啊, 但是最后一句话哈, 挣钱还需要什么鸡汤啊, 同学们挣钱还需要什么鸡汤, 给我努力搞啊, 是不是啊, 好那今天优秀的同学就分享到这里啊, 我想要给大家说的都说了啊, 就是嗯接下来的话就是这个课程结束以后, 我会把大家拉到那个大群里面啊, 那个大群之前是一个付费社群, 然后也是咱们这一期同学的福利啊, 就是会拉到那个群里面, 大家可以去跟之前的学长学姐, 去学习啊, 同时待会儿那个助教老师也会发起一个, 就为了督促大家, 就是接下来不要去荒废掉了, 也会督促大家去参加这个榜样计划啊, 大家就踊跃的报名啊, 就是打铁要趁热啊, 打铁要趁热, 就是一定要自己给自己定下来一个目标, 就是我们当时, 我当时做的那个榜样计划的时候, 也是希望说, 大家可以去学习啊, 希望大家能够用这个活动, 去给自己定目标, 然后督促自己啊, 去完成这个能启动的这个阶段啊, 也希望大家就是能够在这个实践当中, 就是尽快的步入正轨啊, 那我想要说的就这么多啊, 然后接下来就是那个, 大家去找那个助教报名啊, 那个助教要补充一下吗? 嗯, 康康老师你要补充一下吗? 我没有什么要补充的, 就是大家冲呀! 好, 那我们那个合影, 康康你来, 你来截那个, 截屏, 我们就当做造了一个像啊, 就是大家留作纪念, 想起过去曾经你还用了一个月, 很热血的在学习小红书啊, 当你小红书拿到结果的时候, 也欢迎大家来给老师报喜啊, 就是我一定会给你们发上红包鼓励你们啊, 就是大家拿到结果了, 不要忘了来给我报喜, 分享一下你的喜悦啊, 好, 那我们这个截图这个咋整了康康?

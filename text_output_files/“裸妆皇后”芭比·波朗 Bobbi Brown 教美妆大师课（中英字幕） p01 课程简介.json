Her hair was this beautiful beehive and she was very much into the look of the 60s. Definitely part Jackie Kennedy, part Marilyn Monroe, part Twiggy. She looked so glamorous, so stunning. I never ever thought in a million years I could look as glamorous as her. When I was 15 years old and I told my mom I loved makeup, she said, my friend owns a makeup store, let's go. I said great. So I came in and she said would you like a makeover? I said I'd love a makeover. And I sat there and I watched her do my makeup and I never felt uglier in my life. She changed the color of my skin because it was too yellow. She contoured my nose and said it was too big. She drew over my lips, said they were too small and my eyes were too small and she showed me how to paint in a lid. When I got done, I remember looking in the mirror. I don't remember crying but I remember saying oh my god I look awful. I went home, I washed my face, I looked in the mirror, I said I look much better. I think makeup is an individual way of making yourself feel better about how you look. Pretty good. You look gorge. Thanks. I don't believe in following the exact same rules on everyone. Everyone's different. What's beautiful to one isn't always beautiful to someone else, but I've always found beauty in interesting faces. I really do love helping people and makeup is a really powerful tool. My beauty philosophy is really simple. Beauty is what you like to look at, it's what makes you feel good and to me beauty, especially in a face, is someone that is nice, happy and authentic. To me, being authentic makes people beautiful and we are all different. Contacts check. Sorry! MS.ド. имеет do in do we need a poor situation at this time yes, madam from dumb and haid and I think celebrating the differences is what's interesting. And I find all women beautiful. And I also believe that the right makeup, the right exercise, anyone could be a better version of themselves. 007 007 Hey, what makes you so sure I went to prep school? You look stupid and rich. Actually, I'm smart and poor. Uh-uh. I'm smart and poor. What makes you so smart? I wouldn't go for coffee with you. Yeah, well, I wouldn't ask you. Well, that's what makes you stupid. When I was a teenager, I went to the movies and saw Love Story and saw Ally McGraw, hair parted in the middle. I think I still do the same. And her makeup was, like, oh, my God. Oh, so natural. I don't even know if she was wearing it, but she had thick eyebrows. You couldn't really see the eye shadow. There was, might have been a little brown. I started just to realize I couldn't change who I was, and I just needed to find a way to feel good in my skin. And that's when I kind of looked at myself and said, oh, I could be pretty, too. So I graduated high school. I went to college. I designed my own major, theatrical makeup and photography. And then I moved to New York in the 80s, and I started a freelance makeup career. I'll never forget one of the covers I got hired in the beginning was Jerry Hall on the cover of British Cosmo. I was petrified. I did Jerry's makeup not very well. She couldn't have been kinder. She said it's beautiful, and then she redid her whole face. And I watched her, and it was, like, oh, my God. I watched her, and it was remarkable. There was no way I could have ever repeated it because I didn't have that talent to paint the face. But then I realized that she looked better when she washed her face after the shoot. Makeup should not be a mask. Makeup should not change the way you look. You don't wear foundation to change the color of your skin. You don't contour your nose. There's nothing wrong with your nose. You don't overline your lips. Makeup should enhance who you are. This class is for every person who wants to understand and learn how to put on their makeup like a professional makeup artist. I'm going to make it simple. It's like cooking. If you don't understand the simple techniques about cooking, it's not easy. In this class, you'll learn to choose a foundation that looks like your skin, enhance your look with bronzer and blush, play up your eyes and eyebrows, use makeup, and make yourself feel more confident at work, apply the perfect smokey eye, transition your makeup from day to night, and correct common makeup mistakes. No matter what color skin you have, what color eyes you have, what color hair you have, the techniques are what's important. Learn the techniques and you could adapt it to yourself. This class isn't about specific brands, but I will focus on the products I think you should use and give you some of my favorite makeup recommendations. I hope this class encourages you to find confidence beyond how you look, just to be confident in yourself. I hope that some of the stories I share with you will help you just feel better in your skin and learn that you're actually pretty good. I'm Bobbi Brown, and this is my MasterClass.",

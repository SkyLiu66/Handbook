Throw away profit and greed, and there won't be any thieves. These three are superficial and aren't enough to keep us at the center of the circle, so we must also embrace simplicity, put others first, desire little. This chapter is largely a continuation of chapter 18. One thing to remember is that the original text of the Tao Te Ching probably wasn't divided into chapters, so it can be helpful to look at chapters 18 and 19 as one whole. Since we have already covered 18 pretty extensively, and since 19 goes pretty much along the same lines, we'll keep this video a bit shorter and just take a minute to reiterate some of the same themes. Knowledge alone often becomes a pitfall to those who use it. Trying to be kind or good for the wrong reasons is not as beneficial as adopting a true, outward focused perspective, where we see others' needs clearly and make them equal with the world. We are not the only ones with this. We are the ones who are constantly pursuing profit and gain, which leads to inequality and resentment, which leads to pride, selfishness, and crime. If we can learn to cast off these attitudes and follow our intuition, we can be open to harmony with the higher order of the universe, which changes us, instead of just changing our behavior. Trying to act rightly will only lead to superficial changes. In order to truly act rightly, we need to become changed by coming into harmony with a force higher and greater than ourselves. Then we will act rightly, not because we are trying hard to, but because we are trying to and we are not trying to. We are not trying to change our behavior. We are not trying to change the world. We are not trying to change the world. We are not trying to change the world. We are not trying to change the world. We are not trying to change the world. We are not trying to change the world. But as a natural result of coming more in harmony with Tao, and by so doing, becoming one with all things. If you have questions or thoughts about this, let me know, and I will see you all tomorrow for chapter 20. Thanks for watching. Peace and blessings.",

In meditation, go deep in the heart. In dealing with others, be gentle and kind. In speech, be true. In ruling, be just. In daily life, be competent. In action, be aware of the time and the season. No fight, no blame. Now, this is probably not the first time you've been told to be like water, and it probably won't be the last. Water has a lot of the qualities prescribed by Taoism and indeed much of Eastern philosophy. Water can trickle as a stream or it can crash as a wave, but it always does its work by going with the flow of the land, by utilizing the environment around it, and by not striving to make things into that which they are not. The chapter mentions that water flows in places men reject. This is also sometimes translated as water flows in places that men reject. This is also sometimes translated as water flows in places men reject. This is also sometimes translated as water flows in places men reject. This is also sometimes translated as water flows into low places. Water follows the pull of gravity. It doesn't mind being lower than everybody else. Similarly, a master doesn't mind being seen as lower or less important. In fact, he chooses these places. He is meditative, gentle, honest, fair, and kind. He is competent in what he does, but he does not assert his dominance. Although his skill may be great, he knows when is the time to employ it and when it is not. He understands that there is a time and a season for everything. He doesn't blame others. He doesn't blame others. He doesn't blame others. He doesn't pick fights. He does his thing, and he isn't concerned about the result. If we can learn to emulate these qualities, we will find that we, like water, can accomplish much while striving very little. Thanks for watching, and I'll see you all tomorrow for chapter 9.",

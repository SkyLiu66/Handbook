Everyone knows that the soft and yielding overcomes the rigid and hard, but few can put this knowledge into practice. Therefore, the Master says, only he who is the lowest servant of the kingdom is worthy to become its ruler. He who is willing to tackle the most unpleasant tasks is the best ruler in the world. True sayings seem contradictory. Be like water, my friend. We all know the Bruce Lee quote, but it's much easier to recite the quote than it is to put it into practice. We usually like to cast ourselves in the anime protagonist role, as the character who overcomes impossible odds through sheer grit and determination. If things went our way, the entire world would be a canvas on which we'd paint our life's work, shaping and changing the world to suit our needs. Water does the opposite. Lao Tzu praises the attributes of water through multiple chapters of the Dao De Jing. Water does not resist change. When a stone falls into it, it moves out of the way and lets the stone pass. When it's cold outside, water freezes. When it gets very hot, it vaporizes. It's partially the changeability of water that allows it to support life on our planet. It allows itself to change states in order to condense, move around the earth, and fall into places where it's needed. Water isn't picky. It gives life to all people and all creatures, regardless of rank, nationality, or origin. It is very much like the Dao in this way. The Dao nourishes and supports all who seek it. Like water, it does not seek recognition or glory, yet it takes care of all things. The changeability and adaptability of water does not stop it from being strong, however. Water is one of the principal forces for shaping the world as we know it. Through erosion, water can eventually overcome entire mountains, carve out valleys, or make beautiful works of art. The crazy thing about water, though, is that it shapes and changes the world by first yielding to it. Raindrops erode rocks over time, but they do this by yielding to wind and gravity. Water generates no motion in and of itself. It is acted upon by universal forces, and through these forces does its work. When water carves out a valley, it is by running along the natural water. Water is the only natural path as dictated by gravity. It changes the land by first yielding to it. Human beings, unlike water, have the ability to generate motion, to act, rather than only to be acted upon. However, in all our acting, we would do well to remember the example of water, to temper our action with patience and softness. Only when we do this will we be able to act optimally. We've talked a lot about water on the channel already, so I'll link some other videos in the description that you can go to if you want more on that. And as always, thank you for watching, and I will see you tomorrow for chapter 79. Peace and blessings.",

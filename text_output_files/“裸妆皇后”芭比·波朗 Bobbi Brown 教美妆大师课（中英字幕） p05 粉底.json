    "data": " The reason we wear foundation is really simple. Foundation is used to even out your skin tone. And for those women that are lucky enough to already have an even skin tone, you don't need foundation everywhere. The other thing about foundation is it has to be the right color for your skin, it has to be the right formula for your skin, and some women, if they have drier skin, will need the right moisturizer. Other women that have oilier skin will need a powder. It varies from woman to woman. What works on one day might not work the next day. So I suggest that women that wear foundation have a few different variations and know what to do to make the foundation look like you're not wearing foundation. Skin should look like skin. And by the way, the only way to know if the foundation is the right color, is to apply it on the side of your face. If it disappears, it's the right color. The right foundation is like having the right undergarments. Your outfits won't look good if you don't have the right undergarments. Your makeup won't look good if you don't have the right foundation. The models that you see represent different skin color, different ages. There are so many variations, there is no way we could have gotten everybody. But I think that we chose the model so it'll be easy to relate to, and understand different skin colors. The techniques work for everybody. The colors, it really depends what's right for you. I'm hoping to give you all the rules to adapt things to your face. You have to adapt because skin changes, our age changes, and just day to day changes. I will be showing you with the foundation, not only how to pick the right formula, how to pick the right shade, but how to create a foundation that is the right shade for you. How to cover up the little pesky spots on your face. How to use anything from a pencil, to a cream, to a stick, to a liquid, to a tinted moisturizer. But also really important, I'm going to show you how you can make yourself not look tired. Corrector, concealer, under the eyes to brighten up is honestly the secret that women need to know because you just feel and look so much better. So knowing concealer, knowing corrector, knowing foundation, any woman could be their own makeup artist to make themselves look beautiful. Foundation 101. Everyone has to wear whatever works for their skin. Everyone has different textures, different color skin, and what works for your friend doesn't always work for you. The most important thing when you're choosing a foundation is texture. You have to make sure that the skin is smooth, not dry, not oily. So we're starting with cream. An eye cream that's a little bit hydrating, goes under the eyes, and the trick, the smudge. You don't need a lot. A little bit, but what this does is makes sure that the concealer doesn't get into the lines and just sits perfectly under the skin. If there's any extra cream left, put it on your lips. Because most people don't put moisturizer on their lips. They put lip balm, and lip balm sits on your lips, moisturizer absorbs. Then for your skin, you want it not too dewy and not too dry. So you don't need a lot, but just a little bit of moisturizer. And by the way, the right moisturizer just hydrates your skin, gives you that lift you're looking for. And sometimes you don't really even need foundation everywhere. And if you have oily skin, make sure it's an oil-free formula. That's the pre-step. Then, when choosing your foundation, so much depends on how you like to see yourself. I am someone that I like to not see foundation. I like foundation to even out the skin, but not look like you're wearing it. And the trick is to find the right color and the right texture, and make sure your application is impeccable, and make sure you are in the right light. Daylight is the best. So first thing is color. Choosing a foundation First you look at the color, then you look at the texture. You make sure that the color is not lighter than your skin, it's not oranger than your skin, but it really does have to match your skin. Whether you're fair, whether you're dark, you want to make sure that it's got the right tone that blends in. Most of the time, a yellow tone blends into people's skin. Second is texture. You have to make sure the foundation is the right texture for your skin. There's nothing worse than someone who's got very dry skin that uses a foundation that's powder and just sits on the skin. It's aging, it's not pretty. So how do you find the right color? You have to test it. I don't know how people buy foundation for the first time in a closed package they haven't tried. So you have to test it. And honestly, you look at it on the skin. If it disappears in the skin, when you gently put it, it's the right color. Also pay attention to skin on the body, because often women's faces are a different color than their body. This is an example of one that's too light. There's a big difference. I am someone that loves freckles. I always love a woman with freckles. I don't cover it up, but what I do is when I look at the face, I even out any kind of redness, and also, if there's any kind of blemishes, Molly was nice enough to come in with one today. And I am someone that uses my fingers more than I use a brush. Now this is just a complexion pencil that you could use on your skin, under your eyes. It's readily available, but again, you've got to make sure that it's the right color. And I'm really only putting it where I need it. Now a very important thing is that most women have a different color forehead than the rest of their face. And you'll notice, when I do blend it in, it's a pretty light coat. It covers the redness, and that's what the yellow in the foundation does, but it does not cover the freckles. And luckily, it covers the blemishes, or blemish. I love this formula because it's a little bit sheer, so you see the freckles. It does cover the redness. Now you could use your fingers, which I do a lot. You could use a sponge, and I prefer the disposable sponges. You use them once, and then they go. And then also, a foundation brush is such a great way to put it on, and even it out. And as I'm putting it on, a good makeup artist looks and sees what's happening, that all the red is covered. And I'm going to add a concealer afterwards, so I'm not applying the foundation where the concealer is. . . . . . . . . . . . in front of a very strong light, you have to really pay attention. You have to look in the monitor, and you just have to make sure it's naturally covered, especially since whoever thought of and developed HDTV, not the easiest, most flattering light for makeup, great for a football game. I'm not sure about makeup, so you really have to know what you're doing. So then the forehead, which is a little bit of a darker color. And by the way, having a couple colors is okay because different times of the year, you need different things. And when you do your makeup in the morning, this step, when the color's right and the formula's right, you're gonna start to see that the color's right. Should literally take 60 seconds, not more than that. So right now to apply the makeup, I'm using a complexion pencil. I am using a foundation brush that could be also used for putting on moisturizer. And I also am using a sponge, a disposable sponge, and probably the most important, the fingers. And I'm using a sponge to apply the foundation. And I'm using a sponge to apply the foundation. And the great thing is if you see a little bit of a stubborn red spot, you can just add a little bit more on top. So after foundation, I'm gonna add some concealer. Now concealer is one shade lighter than your foundation. Your foundation evens out your skin. Concealer conceals dark circles. It can lift under the eyes. It could make you not look tired. And you can wear concealer without foundation, but you cannot wear foundation without concealer. You can go makeup free and not wear either, but the right foundation, the right concealer, just makes you look less tired, healthier, prettier skin, and looks great in photographs. When choosing formulas, you have a lot of choices. You could use a liquid, you could use a cream, you could use a powder, you could use a pencil. I'm choosing a pencil for Molly because there's very little to really fix on Molly, just to enhance. So it's the most natural way to wear foundation. She could also choose to wear a tinted moisturizer, but tinted moisturizer is sheer, so you would still need a pencil just to do spots. And I am someone who is always on the go. I do my makeup in a car. I literally love things. I literally love things that I don't have to open and close and make it harder for me than it has to. So I love using the pencils. So when you're happy with your foundation, then you do your concealer and corrector. And if you need to touch up a little bit more on the foundation afterwards, you'll know, because it does take a second for it to settle into your skin. So under the eyes. Now, again, Molly has a little bit of redness. She's not that dark under her eyes. She's not that bright. She's not that dark. She's not that dark. So, but this is a color that's one shade lighter. And I could see the redness. Now, if you notice, I put it on. I use my finger to pat. I'm not tugging. I'm patting. And I'm making sure that the concealer doesn't go on your face. Okay. And then I just go with my finger to make sure that it is going into the skin. And I just gently pat it down. And then I use my finger to really get into my skin. And then when I use my fingers, it really goes into the skin. But do you see the difference on Molly with and without? One of my tricks also is I love to use it for people that are deep on the inside, because it really does open up the whole inside and most of them have oil in them or it wouldn't have a slip on your skin, we'll have your eyeshadow creased during the day and we'll have your mascara smear and no one wants that. Look up for a second. So the trick is, and a lot of women do this wrong, is to go up close to the lashes, cover up the redness, go on the inner corner, and before you blend it in, by the way, that's how you know if it's the right color. If it is lifting the darkness, it's the right color. So this is what it looks like before I blend it in. And again, this is studio lighting, so you have to go a little bit heavier, but it's the right color. Then you take your finger and you gently pat it in. And as your skin gets darker, if you're someone that tans in the summer, you are going to need a darker color of this, which is why a woman should have a couple different colors because she could wear it on her skin, under her eyes, correcting any blemishes, and it's quick and it's easy. And just know that when you put foundation on, you give it a minute. It absorbs into your skin, and if for some reason it's not absorbed into your skin, it's either the wrong color, or often your skin is probably drier from the inside out. A lot of women don't realize if the day after a really fun party, you might have eaten and drank things that are not really considered beauty food, and guess what? You have to take a little extra attention to fix it. So stop your makeup if it's not working. Go drink a water. Hydrate yourself. Put a little touch of oil on your skin if your skin is really dry, and that will make a big difference. And then depending on your skin, if your skin is oily, you've got to put a little powder on top of it, and if your skin is dry, you could skip it. I don't use powder because my skin is normally on the dry side. Because we did moisturizer, we're under the lights, I'm going to show you how to choose a powder that just kind of sets it in place. And again, you don't need a lot. I'm not putting it on with a puff. I'm just going to put a little powder that's going to take the shine away. Powder on top of the concealer and the foundation will pretty much lock it in place. But the important thing is to choose a powder that is not translucent, because translucent is not invisible. It's just a little bit of a layer of powder. And then you're going to put a little powder on top of it. And then you're going to put a little powder on top of it. And then you're going to put a little powder on top of it. And it's not going to be invisible, it makes your skin ashy, but choose a powder that really matches the skin. And again, when you put it on, it's got to look right. It can't look dry. It can't look dry. I am using a brush that is cut to a point because it fits right under the eyes, it fits around the nose, but it's still big enough to use all over on the skin. all over on the face. And it looks absolutely perfect on Molly because it's not powdery. And then another trick, another makeup artist trick, and because the way the brush is cut like this, you just go right on the eyelids, and then guess what? When you do your eye makeup, you won't need an eyeshadow base. My whole goal for makeup is to use makeup that's quick, easy, and I like to use multi-use products. I don't like to have a lot. I like things really simple. And most women are overwhelmed, and they just don't need so many things. So when I am done with concealer, foundation, and powder if needed, I want the woman, my model, myself, to look better than I did a minute ago. If you don't look better, something's wrong. So to recap what I used, two moisturizers, one under the eye, one on the skin. I used three pencils, one for under the eye, one for her darker forehead, and another one for her skin. I used a foundation brush and a sponge to even it out, and my fingers. I also used a little bit of skin tone correct powder with brushes that are cut to a point, one for the whole face, one for under the eyes, and around the nose. You really only need one, and I would go with the smaller one. And the trick is, she looks better than she did a few minutes ago without the makeup. She looks good either way. I am someone that actually likes the way people look without makeup, especially foundation. I am someone that actually likes the way people look without makeup, especially foundation. But when you are wearing foundation, you've got to make sure that the foundation you're putting on your skin makes your skin look better. You can't just put it on your face. Foundation for black skin is definitely different than foundation for lighter skin. The rules are the same, meaning formula and the color has to be right for the skin. Some differences are a lot of women with darker skin have discoloration in their skin. Sometimes they have three or more tones. Often there's women that have a different color face than their body. So there's a few things you need to know to be able to do it. So there's a few things you need to know to be able to do it. So there's a few things you need to know to be able to do it. Mostly what you need to know is that you have to look, and then you have to use your brain and your fingers to figure out how to correct things. I learned a lot from all of my years being on set with makeup artists. But what I really want people to know is you've got to make sure that when the foundation is done, they look like they're not wearing any makeup. So for oilier skin, we're going to use a moisturizer that doesn't have any oil. There are a lot of oil-free moisturizers on the market. And you want one that just hydrates the skin, makes it smooth, but it doesn't stay on the skin like an oily moisturizer would. Put it under the eyes, on the lips. And that's how I prep a face for foundation. Many people don't use a brush for a moisturizer. I like using a foundation brush for moisturizer. I find it's easier. It's easier in application. And it also, I think, just feels good. So I even on myself, I use my fingers sometimes, but I often use a brush. So now we're going to choose the color. There are so many colors of foundations. The good news now, there's many lines that have 30, even 40 different colors. So no matter what your color is, there is a color for you. But again, the only way to know if it's going to work is to try it on the side of the face if it blends in. So I am going to show you a couple options and why it's often so difficult. Here's one color. And here is another color. Now, before I rub it in, if you notice, one of them is a little more yellow, and that is way too light. The one that actually works has a little bit more of this skin color, which looking at it, it's just got a little bit more warmth. So not yellow, a little more orange and bronzy. But when I'm looking at her face, I want to make sure that when I put it on her face, I don't have to make up her body. So it is on the side of the face and blending in. So I will take that off. And by the way, you can take off foundation or any mistakes you make with the moisturizer. The right moisturizer for your skin, actually, is a great makeup remover in a pinch. OK. So you could use a pencil. You could use a cream. You could use a powder. You could use many different things. Where the pencil that I use a lot is great for spots. But when you really want to even out the skin, a good cream formula that is basically a stick or it could be poured into a compact is what I recommend. So this is the cream formula. And the color that blends in perfectly, I am going to apply with a brush. And I always start on the cheek because as I'm putting it on, I see that it's blending in. And what's great about this color, if there's a little bit of darkness around the mouth, you could just use this color to kind of brighten it a little bit. So it's almost like the color is correcting and brightening the darker areas. And often people or makeup artists or women will choose a color that they might think is the right color, but it's not. So it's really tricky to make sure that you're finding the right one. And I love when your foundation does most of the work for you, meaning it evens out the skin, makes it look beautiful, covers the darkness. But I'm going to show you how we can correct afterwards anything that's not perfect. This is really important. On her skin, her chest and her arms, I'm going to be using a little bit of a brush. And I'm going to use a little bit of a brush to make sure that I'm not going to be using a brush that's too thick. I'm going to use a brush that's too thin. You can even pull this up a little bit. If you don't have a brush like this one, you can just use a brush of however much you want and it's amazing. With my 3D pen, I only need one color for this side. I'm going to draw in on my upper cheek. And then as you can see, in my neck, the lower accessories are this color. Her neck is a little yellower, so I'm going to show you with bronzer And her skin is really good. It's really healthy. You could tell she's very healthy. There are some dark spots which we will even out. And then we will also add her concealer corrector. So for concealing, this is something that you have to make sure you have the right color. Because there is nothing worse than someone that wears too light of concealer and it looks ashy because a lot of women of color, a lot of black women, if the tones are not right, they look ashy. Same thing with Latin women, deeper skin tones. It's got to make sure that there's no ashiness. So under her eyes. I'm going to go. To a concealer brush. A concealer brush, by the way, is could be many different things. I'm using this flat one that's pointed. And I'm just using one that is one shade lighter. And the right concealer. Will correct. Okay. So I'm going to go ahead and blend it in. And anything with a little bit of a peachiness to it will literally get rid of any kind of purple under the eyes. And again, I'm going on the inner corner to open it up. Taking my hand to gently Pat. So it's blended in, but not. That it hasn't gone away. Just on the darkest. Pop parts if necessary. So for Andrea, her skin is beautiful. She's a little bit of combination skin, a little bit on the oily side. So we chose to use an oil free moisturizer. And. There really isn't any issues with being ashy. But. I can feel that. But see the difference in the two sides. And once we put a powder on her face and really blended together, it will be perfect. But this gives her a bright look. And this gives her a deeper look. Okay. And it's going on. So smooth. Because we put a little bit of the moisturizer. On it. So it's going on. and I love brushes that have two sides one that you could put a concealer on and the other that you can really use it for powder and anytime you do concealer corrector and foundation you need to give it at least 60 seconds if not a few minutes of time to absorb into the skin so it really becomes more natural looking so while while that is happening I'm going to use a little bit of a complexion stick in the right color to try to get rid of any spots that the foundation didn't cover and this has a little bit of red to it which is why it's working so well on the darker spots you can see how it's working so well on the lighter spots you can see how it's working so well on the lighter spots the stick is the same color as the foundation and what I love about it it's denser and formula so it just gets right on those pieces that didn't get covered by the foundation and even though we've gone for an even all-over look still looks natural her skin looks like skin to take the shine off but really have it part of the skin I'm gonna use a powder a little bit of brown very lightly just on the parts that there's a little bit of shine and by the way what this does it keeps the foundation on longer this is a brush that's a powder brush and because it's cut to a point it's the perfect brush to go around the nose to go under the eyes to even go across the eyes and especially women that have oilier skin that's going to take the shine away for Andrea I'm going to go a little bit more on the lower part of the nose to get that shine off and then I'm going to go a little bit more on the lower part of the nose to get that shine off and then I'm going to go a little bit lighter with powder under the eyes and this is really important when you do the powder after you've done corrector or concealer make sure it's smooth because when you put the powder on it's going to lock in place voila look how even she looks voila look how even she looks",

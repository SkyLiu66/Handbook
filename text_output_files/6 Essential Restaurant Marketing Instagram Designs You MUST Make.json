So then that way, you can engage with your customers, you can bring value to them, and you can stay top of mind. Ultimately, this gives you more sales. And that's the reason why you should start taking notes. Let's start with point number one. Design creatives you should create our campaign assets. What are those they're basically different events, different flavors, different items, anything that allows you to create a campaign about so then that way people have something fresh to talk about. For example, McDonald's and Travis Scott did a campaign together a collaboration together and they created a new campaign. This stands out from the original content, the usual content of just simply cheeseburgers, fries, and all that. Now, they have something new, something novel, something to actually bring in their old customers. And another reason to bring in the younger generation that actually likes Travis Scott. So that's a prime example of what a campaign looks like. And for you as a restaurant owner, think about different campaigns that you want to run, whether it be creating burgers and poutine fries on National Burger Day, or whether to create a new type of chocolate for National Chocolate Day. These are all great areas where you can create campaigns. And so that's the reason why you should start cooking food.

It means information in graphic terms. Usually this is done when there's a lot of words, complex ideas, put it in a visual digestible format. And as you can see here, this is something that we've created for our infographic. And now this is a little bit more sophisticated. And once again, this is created by Penji. As you can see, quality is there, super affordable and very timely. So definitely check them out. Now in a restaurant context, how would you be able to utilize infographics while creating something like how Chipotle did with the hierarchy of needs, making it more relevant and engaging to share it with their customers. And as a customer, when I see something like this, I'm much more engaged because it's funny and it's also very relevant to me. And at the same time, it makes sharing it to my friends very easy. I would just see this image, I'll be like having a little chuckle and giggle and I'll send it to Jason. Right? Same thing with Cactus Club. They did an amazing job making and inputting humor into a pie chart. So then that way it's something different aside from just signature photos of their items over and over again. This type of infographic, not only is much more engaging, but also much more shareable. So then that way you can reach much more customers. The fourth design assets are carousels. What are carousels? Carousels are different slides within Instagram. So then that way you can actually tell a lot more information to your customers with each of these slides. The beautiful thing about carousels is the fact that the more people that slides on it, the more engagement Instagram sees of you and your customers are having. And in turn, it shows your feed to even more customers out there. So that says a lot about why carousels are so important because it allows you to be able to reach a lot of people. On the second hand, carousels are important because it also allows you to educate your customers. A lot of brands and restaurants use carousels to educate their customers. Why do we want to educate our customers? Because it builds trust. How do we build trust? Because when you are educating your customers, when your customers are learning something, they would feel thankful and they would feel like, Oh wow, this restaurant knows what they're talking about. And the upselling topic. And I know you're going to go forward but youloott<|en|>입! As you put a traditional online app there is youloottie Gobierno style. talking about. And there is going to be a lot of trust that's being built. And like what I always say, trust is the only factor why someone will ever buy from you. So that's the reason why when you collectively give out content of value, and content that is funny content that is engaging your customers trust in your brand built as well. And most likely they'll always come back to you again and again. The fifth type of design asset for your restaurant are ads. What are ads as you know, Instagram is now becoming more of a pay to play game. What does that mean? It means that if you start paying Instagram to run advertisements, then your posts and the stuff you create would get into the eyeballs of your customers. But if you stop paying, then they limit your reachability. And that's the reason why a lot of people are jumping into ads and apps are very, very affordable on Instagram and on Facebook. So that's the reason why if you're creating design assets, definitely create them. So then that way, if it's an ad, it's going to be a lot more affordable. And that's the reason why if you're creating ads, you're going to be able to get more people to use your ads. So that's the reason why you're going to be able to get more people to use your ads. So that's the reason why you're going to format. And you would want to always test out different types of assets and different types of designs in order for you to know what is going to work with your customers. And that's how we are able to scale our restaurant by testing out multiple different design assets. The sixth type of restaurant marketing design assets you need to create our Instagram stories. Now if you still think that restaurant and Instagram stories are a thing of the past, or that it's only a fad, then really think again, because there are more than 500 million active users that are on Instagram stories every single day. One out of four Gen Z's tell us that they would actually look at stories to decide what to buy and what to eat.

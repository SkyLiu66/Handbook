It's going to be so much fun, as you can probably see from the title. We are going to be talking about Bookstagram today and I'm so excited. So I did a little question box a few days ago on my Instagram asking if anybody had any requests for video ideas on my YouTube channel, like book videos. And I had a couple people request a book photo behind the scenes and then I had someone request book photography tutorials. And then I posted on my story the response and I asked if people would want to see that and they said yes. It's very majority voted that they wanted to see that. So that's what we're going to be doing today. I am so excited. I've been really excited. I've been really excited. I've been really excited. I've been really excited. I've been really excited. I've been really excited. I've been really excited. I've been really excited. I've been really excited. I've been really excited. I've been really excited. I've been really excited. I've been really excited. I've been really excited. I've been really excited. I've been really excited. Now, ultimately, I am really excited for my Ask Sam. I read all of the questions and it was such a wonderful story, like, man, this book is pretty awesome, and I wish I could have listened earlier and not had chosen to read it, because it was just so leading. I feel that framing was the best it squat back to tell people, wake up mujeres last in the 50s, pulling virtually all these stepped up roughly increasing any more of this boom and all thisucha. There are a lot of great stories that I heard about that. I did we go in about 20,000 times just to give aniu- same like aesthetic, the same way I take the photos. I follow so many like cute Instagrammers. I'm obsessed with them. They post such cute things and I get so much inspo from them. So I will do that and then I will take the photos. So a lot of times if I'm just taking a photo of a book, I will use my bed and I have like this perfect dreams blanket and my comforter and this other comforter and I will just set it there and take a photo. And one tip that I have is to like angle the phone up or angle it like this. Just the angle of the photo really changes how the photo is going to look. So as you can see probably from the clips, like if the book is like this, I'm trying to angle it with the book and not like this. You know what I mean? I'm trying to keep it at a good angle. And also when I have like the four book stacks sitting there, I want to be above it because if you're like at an angle, it kind of just looks weird. So I try to be like straight above the photos so I can get just like a flat lay. You know what I mean? I do take some photos with my Kindle. Like if I read an ARC or I read a book on my Kindle, that I don't own and want to take a picture of and I will edit the cover onto my Kindle. I use Photoshop, but I know there's an app you can use for this, but I just couldn't figure it out. And I have like a semi-knowledge of Photoshop in order to do that. So I just edit on Photoshop and I will also show you me doing that. After I like take the photos, I will go through all of them and like hard to my favorite ones and then I'll import them into Lightroom. So I use J.T. Marie's presets. I'm pretty sure she doesn't sell them anymore. My vibe is more like, warm pinky tones. So I'll use the same preset on every single photo that I post, which I think creates an aesthetic on your feet if you use the same preset. So",

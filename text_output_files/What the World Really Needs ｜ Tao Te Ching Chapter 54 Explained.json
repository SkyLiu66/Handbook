Maintain the community, te becomes extensive. Maintain the country, te becomes public. Maintain the world, te becomes omnipresent. Therefore, through self, contemplate self. Through family, contemplate family. Through community, contemplate community. Through country, contemplate country. Through world, contemplate world. How do I know the world? Like this. When people set out to try and do good, they often start right away by rolling up their sleeves with dreams of change. Changing the world. This is a serious mistake. Note the order prescribed in this chapter of the Tao Te Ching for dealing with te, or virtue. First comes the self. Before we are bothered with the virtue of anyone or anything else, we first need to be concerned with the virtue of the self. We take full responsibility for our own self. We work to bring our own self as in line with Tao as possible. If we skip this step and head straight for the others, disaster is sure to follow. We simply cannot rely on the self to do good. We cannot rely on the self to do good. We cannot reliably affect lasting positive change on anyone or anything without first being in harmony with Tao ourselves. If we are not in line with Tao, our efforts to benefit the world are pointless, often even harmful. However, as we draw closer to Tao and come into harmony with it, we become changed by it. As this occurs, we will become natural embodiments of te, or virtue. We will do good things not because we are trying to, but as a natural result of who we are. Because of this, our virtue will never be the same. We will become natural embodiments of the self. We will never become natural embodiments of the self. We will never become natural embodiments of the self. naturally have positive effects on those around us. As more and more individuals do this, families, communities, nations, and eventually the world will abound in Tei. This is not the result of any person's righteous crusade, but of millions and billions of individuals coming into harmony with Dao on their own personal journeys. Will this ever happen to the world? To be honest, I don't know. I guess the point I'm trying to get across here is that the best thing that we can do to try and change the world is to come into harmony with Dao ourselves to the greatest degree we possibly can. Only by doing this will we be able to positively affect our families, then our communities, all the way up to the world. In all my study of history and human behavior, I am becoming more and more convinced that no government, no laws, no institution can solve the problems caused by a deficiency of Tei among the people they govern. It's kind of like how they say you can't exercise enough to compensate for a bad diet. I don't think that you can govern enough to compensate for a populist's tendency to choose greed, ambition, pride, and fear over oneness and harmony. Any system that tries to do so will not succeed. Now remember, at the end of the day, I'm not a political scientist. I'm not a professional anything, really. I'm just a guy with a computer that likes Daoism. If you also have a computer and also like Daoism, I think that you would also like my Discord. Every time I put one of these videos out breaking down a chapter of the Tao Te Ching, I open up a thread, for discussion about the chapter. It's a great place to learn, get different perspectives, and find other cool people who are passionate about philosophy. And as always, thanks for watching, and I will see you all tomorrow for chapter 55. Peace and blessings.",

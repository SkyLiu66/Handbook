    "data": " all right in this video guys i'm going to share with you how to go ahead and buy a monetized youtube channel on this website called accsmarket.com so i'm going to pretend like i want to buy a monetized channel and all you have to do is to follow up with me now basically guys quickly right here the first thing you want to do is to sign up for an account and then the next thing you want to do is you want to add some money to your balance like i said follow up with me now the reason being that is if you scroll right here to the end and we go on to escrow service let's move down to the next tab while screen that to the top you can see right here that for you to actually go ahead let's go for youtube to buy youtube channel you need to pay what is called a service fee right here so a buyer pays seven percent service fee so the first thing you want to do is to add money to your account right here to your balance right here and then into your account so that you can use that to pay for your service fee so you can decide to add like ten dollars or five dollars or any amount so let's say ten dollars and then you can decide what um payment method you want to use for me most times i just use crypto but you have any of this payment method you could easily use and then click on to pay and then you can the whole process is so easy from then so once you have money right here on your account that you can use for your service fee like i showed you right here then you want to go ahead and click on the payment button and start looking for channels to buy now for youtube channel you want to make sure you tick on to youtube and also um quickly you want to make sure you click on to verify listing any monetization enable um verify identity and then you click on to search but something that i also do is i also look for subject now i'm not going to do that in this video so i'm just going to click on to search and this is going to search for these videos these channels based on all of these um search filters that are placed in writing here so going down below you can see all of the channels right here now one mistake people think probably it's not your fault is when you see premium it means like they are the best and that is not true actually people pay to put their their channels in front of you so it's not like they are the best channels right there and so making you to negate other people's channel that doesn't have the premium it's what this means is that these people paid this website to actually glaciate their website right here so it doesn't really mean that they are the best channel right there so now the the one thing you need to consider is what type of channel you want so it all depends so i'm just going to go through like let's say i want to create a channel on tutorial based videos that is niche so i'm going to actually look for review out to educational videos and the rest right there so um one thing that i actually look for channels like i said i'm going to be pretending like i want to buy a channel is i want to make sure that the subscribers is more than 1200 subscribers so this this looks like my typical type of channel so i'm going to take this to the next tab um this right here looks like my typical it has the subscriber account but it's under the niche nature so i'm going to leave that right here so we see um this is not it's nowhere near our threshold it has 1000 subscribers and we want 1200 subscribers at most at least sorry so we are not going to do anything to this and it's not also in our niche so we keep on screwing to look for something okay this looks like something we would want and this also so let's just use this to be for example probably just add this fourth one for example and that is how i go about so i look at this channel now looking at this channel i look at um the attached image it has 4000 hours it is monetized all right and also lastly it has no copyright issue so this seems like a good channel to buy and i want to make sure i look at the description monetized channel in nft and crypto niche no strike no copyright the channel is clean and the rest of that right there and what you want to do right here is simply click on to this right here so the link of the channel go on to youtube and see that channel for yourself while this is loading i'll just go on to the second one we actually looked at that for so we go on go on to the attached image yes it's monetized no copyright issue and it has 4 000 hours and the subs are complete so we could decide to also look through this one so i'm going to go on to the next step for this and i'll check this just the last one we're going to check right here so right here you could see this is money was monetized march 13 that is it is monetized it has a subscribe button and then you can see that it has a subscribe button and a subscriber it has a subscriber it has the hours right there so cancel this let's go through other screenshots probably other screenshots and unnecessarily just take this to the next up so moving on um let me cancel this right here so we're going to be using these three one um two and also three they are still loading so this is the first one the nft wolf right here so what i actually do check is go into the about section straight up and make sure that it's it's not a new channel so you could see november 2022 that is like um december january february march april and we're at me so five months ago so this seems pretty okay i'll go on to the videos and look out for the type of videos they are creating sometimes i also actually watch these videos and what i actually do while watching the video is i want to check if it is human voice speaking that is something i just want for my own channel and you should do that also um so you can do that i'm not going to play this video for copyright sake and the rest too i'm going to let that for you but basically check the about section make sure it's a little bit old channel around two months three months is fine and make sure the videos are getting some views and probably also human voice on the video so this is the first one so for this i would fairly say based on what we've seen that we can go ahead and buy this video and i'm going to go ahead and buy this video and channel but then let's just go to the second right here and then we go on to the about section like i said 23rd uh 23 january i think that is far enough and then we go on to the videos um these are just tutorial videos and math videos type of stuff probably yes i would also want to buy this type of channel depending on my niche also so i'll go to the about section of this i'm not going to actually buy this type of channel and i'm going to tell you one reason straight off it is because these are vlog videos and i probably i would looking at the videos looks like it is created yeah but basically because i'm looking for a tutorial based i'm really i may not actually buy this channel but then you see basically how everything looks so let's say we want to buy this channel we just simply click on to buy this channel we'll click on to um the bitcoin or any payment method like transfer bank transfer paper you see they have a lot right here and then you're just simply fixing your email address now this email address you are fixing right here is going to be the email address that you are going to attach your youtube channel to so make sure it's a clean email address now take a look at the whole process of buying channel on this platform now first thing first you pay your service fee the second thing is that the seller of the channel assigned the escrow agent as manager and then after seven days the seller assigned the escrow agent as the primary owner of that channel and then once that is done the escrow agent will verify everything on that channel remove all the information that is left for when you decrease this tracking number as I said that this is our target of purchase of this channel we'll remove some of the energy there and you see other managers including the seller and then notify you as the buyer to pay the seller so once you pay the seller and the seller confirms it then the escrow agent will transfer ownership to you so it's very safe on this platform right there but basically this is the whole process of buying a channel but i also have one thing for you for those of you that could be scared or you do not want to go all through the whole process of buying channels or going to this website and reeks in buying

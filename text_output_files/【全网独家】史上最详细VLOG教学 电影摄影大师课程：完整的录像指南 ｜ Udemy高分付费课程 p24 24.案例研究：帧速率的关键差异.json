    "data": " Our eyes, yes the eyes in our head, most closely see to 24 frames per second. This is normal life speed with the natural motion blur of your eye. If you look at your hand and you do this, you're going to see that there's a slight motion blur that your eye is actually seeing. Now if I'm shooting at 24 frames per second on my camera or my phone, there's going to be a similar motion blur if we have the shutter speed at the proper level. And so the frame rate really has to do with the way it looks is in comparison to what your eye normally sees. Hopefully that's making sense. This causes a similar motion blur that's similar in detail to moving objects that our eye sees. So films choose to shoot 24 as their standard. Standard style of frame rate because it creates that pleasing look that your eye is naturally used to. This is a soft, a little surreal and 24 has this really cool film-esque appearance. Now on the other hand, 30 frames per second. I'll try not to get too technical here, but this has more of a realistic broadcast TV home movie kind of almost fake feeling. Yeah, you know news stations, old VHS. Yeah, you know news stations, old VHS. Camcorders for home movies. They have this kind of like weird fake non-real feeling and you see a news anchor and he looks very plasticky. That's because they're shooting all at 30 frames per second. And even though that's only 6 frames per second faster than 24. It really does change the look. So I personally don't recommend ever shooting at 30 frames per second. There's not really a need unless you're really going for that stylistic choice for a specific purpose. Stick to 24. Next up is 60 frames a second. Okay, this is almost doubling the normal speed of life at 24 frames a second. 60 you're doubling the frame rate, which is perfect for action. It has this very like high definition look because it's picking up twice as many pictures per second or frames per second. But it can feel a little plasticky if it's for a talking interview. Okay, so the way and the reason you would use that if you wanted to. Slow down that footage in post-production for a slow motion like montage or cutaway shots, which we'll talk about. But it just gives it a much different feeling when you have that frame rate. Okay, because you're doubling what you would normally see. And lastly 120 and 240 frames a second. You're rarely going to shoot like this, but this is really cool for really epic slow motion. Dramatic style footage. That's when you would want to use a really high frame rate of 120 to 240. So hopefully that gives you a kind of idea for when and where to use what kind of frame rate. Now what I'm going to do is switch over my camera from 24 to 30 and to 60. So you guys can see the aesthetic difference. All right, so now we're at 30 frames a second. It'll be a slight difference, a slight little change. And there's a lawnmower outside. So. I apologize. I'm hoping it doesn't pick up too much on the mic. But yeah, right now we're at 29.97 frames per second, which is 30 frames per second. And yeah, you can kind of see the difference. Now let's go to 60 frames per second or in some cases 59.94 frames per second. And so now that's a pretty big difference because we're doubling our frame rate. And if I wanted to now I can slow this down in post-production like this. So you can see it creates a much very dramatic style of effect. So you won't want to use 60 frames when you're filming someone because it kind of has a little bit of a plastic look. So if we pop back over to 24 frames a second. So as you can see, it's a much more natural look and feel at 24 frames a second. But I'm hoping that this gives you guys a really, really solid understanding of how to use your camera. Settings without any of the extra fluff or stuff that you really don't need to know. But this will really get you off the ground and able to shoot in any scenario with whatever kind of camera you're shooting with. So now in the next lecture, we're going to do a learning exercise where you guys are going to be able to apply these actual understandings and techniques to your own shoot and project. So I will see you guys in the next learning exercise.",

So now that you guys have seen, it's pretty interesting how different environments reflect sound in different ways, how the settings on the camera or whatever you're using to record, how that changes the sonics as well, and kind of, you know, an overall view of shadowing me on how to choose your locations. Now I want to actually record a voiceover that we're going to use later in this course for you guys so you can see how I would actually go about doing that. So let's do it. I'm going to actually grab this camera in the back and we're going to get started. All right, perfect. So we have this other camera here. And right now I'm going to scroll over to the audio settings. And yeah, right now, as you can see, it's set to manual. Now, if we go into that setting, we can see our record levels. And when I'm speaking right now, it's hitting just below negative 12. And negative 12 is really the sweet spot where you want to be getting the majority of your audio peaking at or just above that region. You never want it to get to zero because that's when it starts distorting. So for this shotgun specifically in this scenario, the manual setting is actually set pretty a little bit low. So we're going to turn that up. What I do is just select it, scroll the wheel up. And now you can see where it's pretty much peaking just about or right below the negative 12, which is perfect. Now, what I want to show you guys is the difference in sound quality. If we take a listen to me talking and then when I stop talking. OK, you hear a little bit of the room tone, a little bit of the atmosphere. But if I were to change it to automatic, let's see what that sounds like. Now we're on auto. And so we can see what. The you know, we can see what the recording situation and what the recording quality sounds like. So while I'm talking, it sounds fine. But when I stop talking. The camera is doing its best to boost the levels to what it thinks that I want to record. Right. So the auto is great for different scenarios where you don't really have the capability of changing settings. Let's say you're at a concert. And it's quiet and there's people that you're interviewing and talking to. And then you're recording the live audio of the concert coming through the speakers. That's going to be a big fluctuation. That situation you may want to do auto unless you're going to be, you know, changing your settings. But it's just good to know that when you have a sit down interview or you're sitting down recording your own video, you want to set that audio recording setting to manual so that you can get the audio recording. So that you can get the audio recording. So that you can get the audio recording. So that you can get the audio recording. So that you can get the crisp audio that's hitting at the right amount of input for your voice. And then when you stop speaking, it's not trying to fluctuate the amount of input to maintain that amount of sound that's coming in.",

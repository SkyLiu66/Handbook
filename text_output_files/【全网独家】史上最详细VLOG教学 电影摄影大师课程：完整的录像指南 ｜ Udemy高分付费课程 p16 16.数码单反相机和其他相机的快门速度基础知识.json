And I have a cow because I have kind of a funny way of explaining it because I think shutter speed is a little bit harder of a principle to understand, but I want to really give you guys an example that will help you always remember it. So the basis is, is the slower our shutter speed, generally you'll see it one 50th of a second, 100th of a second, 200th of a second, the slower it is, the more blurry our image is going to be in terms of motion, not in terms of sharpness or blurriness when it comes to the quality of your lens. That's a different kind of sharpness that's picking up on how crisp certain parts of the images are without movement. Shutter speed is adjusting the blurriness of movement and of brightness of the image. Okay. So if we take this cow example, let's imagine that you have barn doors on a barn and you have cows and these cows in this scenario will be photons of light. All the light in this scenario that's hitting the sensor of the lens. The aperture is going to be adjusting how wide the, um, the opening is on the lens. Okay. The wider the aperture, the more light. The more cows are going to be able to get into that barn and fill that barn. And the shutter speed is how quickly those barn doors are opening and closing. The shutter is literally opening and closing inside your camera, unless it's a mirrorless camera. It's slightly different, but there's still ways to adjust, uh, for the shutter speed by they do it electronically, but that opening and closing is literally happening in your camera to adjust how much light for how long is hitting that sensor. So a faster shutter speed is going like this. There's not too many cows, not too much light being able to expose that frame. If it's going like this, I'm going to have a lot of light photon cows getting into your sensor and brightening your image, right? The higher the number, the less cows getting into the camera, the less bright the image, the lower the number, the slower it's opening and closing. The more those cows can, these freaking, the more those cows can come in, but the more of. Uh, blurry movement is going to be in your image. And I'll demonstrate this, uh, with my camera so you guys can see, but a good rule of thumb is if you're doing something that's action oriented, a hundredth of a second and above is going to give you crisp movement with motion. A hundredth and below is going to give you a much more softer, uh, look with motion blur. Now you want your shutter speed to really double your frame rate. All. Feature films use this kind of golden rule to mimic the natural motion blur that our eyes have. Every time we're doing that, we're naturally creating a more sin of what we call a cinematic image because the closer we mimic the eye with depth of field and with motion blur, just the better of image looks and the way that feature films have learned how to do that. And it's kind of an industry standard that if you start doing it with your camera, you'll create that kind of cool, soft looking cinematic look is doubling your shutter speed. It doubles the frame rate that you're shooting at. So if you're shooting at 24 frames a second, ideally your shutter speed is anywhere from 50 to a 60th of a second. Okay. And if your frame rate is shooting at 60 frames per second, and we'll get into frame rates, so don't worry. You want your shutter speed to be around a hundred. And. 20th for a similar natural looking motion blur. Okay. All feature films use this guideline and this creates a motion blur that's aesthetically pleasing. So with the information that we just covered, here's an example of different shutter speeds. Now we have three different images here of the same exact object that shot at different shutter speeds. Now, can you guess what this image here on the farthest left, what shutter speed that is, would that be a higher low shutter speed? Okay. Yes, it would be a high shutter speed. So this was shot at 150th of a second. You see how it's not capturing any blur because the opening and closing of the lens is so fast that when it exposed the image, it captured the moment so quickly that there was no motion blur. Now something in the middle, this is one 30th of a second, and you can see a slight blur because in that one 30th of a second, and the camera really is counting. One 30th of a second, that pinwheel moved that amount of time in that short amount of one 30th in a second. If I go boop and that's one 500th of a second, the pinwheel thing is not going to be able to move very far before it gets exposed for. So I think now that's probably starting to make sense. And for this last one, obviously this is a very slow shutter speed. This is one fourth of a second. So now I'm going to demonstrate on my camera.",

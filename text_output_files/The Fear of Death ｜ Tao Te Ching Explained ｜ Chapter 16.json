To return to the source is to recover what is permanent. Knowing what is permanent, enlightenment. Not knowing what is permanent, disaster. Knowing what is permanent opens the mind. Open mind, open heart. Open heart, magnanimity. Magnanimity, a virtue of queens and kings. A true queen or king lives in accord with nature. To live in accord with nature is to find the Tao. Following the Tao makes death harmless. The fear of death is about the most natural fear in the world. After all, we human beings are physical creatures with bodies and brains that are completely concerned with preserving our physical safety. The primary objective of the body and brain is to keep themselves alive, so it makes sense to keep them alive. It makes sense that we would naturally resist the idea of death. However, like many of our body's natural instincts, our aversion to our own mortality causes us a lot of unnecessary discomfort and suffering. At the end of the day, life and death is just another of the many cycles that are part of the world we live in. Actually, there are very few things in our lives that are not subject to this law of cycles. Most things we experience tend to undergo some sort of oscillation or cycle, rather than remaining constant and unchanged. Rather than one long stretch of unchanging weather conditions and one holiday that repeats over and over again, we experience the passage of years through the rhythmic novelty of seasons, each new in relation to the last, but repetitive over the course of a year. We experience cycles in our feelings as well. Rather than experiencing constant excitement or interest about our work, relationships, or hobbies, our enthusiasm toward pretty much everything in our lives tends to wax and wane. We move back and forth between quote-unquote hard times and quote-unquote good times. Our economies are subject to boom and bust cycles that make repetitive patterns throughout history. Likewise, the existence of all things is subject to cycles. Things are born and then eventually die and return to their native states. Almost nothing lasts forever. The only constant, unchanging things in the universe are the Tao, or higher power or order of the universe, and the cycle of change itself. It is a useful exercise to ponder or meditate on the cyclical nature of life and death. All things come from dust and return to dust. Pretty much nothing is exempt. And really, when you think about it, would you even want to live forever? I think for a lot of us, it's a very simple question. We don't have to live forever. We don't have to live forever. We don't have to live forever. This idea is really kind of exhausting. In preparing to make this video, I came across some people expressing the opinion, I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of suffering. Well, this is also a pretty natural conclusion to come to, and I certainly wouldn't blame anybody for being afraid to suffer. Again, what could be more natural or human? However, I do think that there are a couple of things worth addressing about this viewpoint. In chapter 13, we already discussed that much of our suffering in this life comes from having a body, as indicated in this passage. What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body which I call myself. If I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me? Having a body causes suffering because pain, hunger, disease, and even things like social rejection cause our brains to feel threatened for survival. Therefore, if suffering is only suffering because of the potential harm to our body, then the fear of death and suffering are really just different sides of the same coin. I do want to also amend what we talked about in chapter 13 video by saying that suffering comes not only from having a body, but also from having a body. Suffering comes from experiencing the having of a self. Said a different way, suffering comes from experiencing ourselves as separate from the great oneness of the universe and all things. If we truly experienced ourselves as being one with everything around us, and we were at peace with the eventual decay and expiration of our physical bodies, then theoretically we would have no reason to suffer. Therefore, death is frightening because we see it as an end to the physical body and an end to the thing which we call our self. Suffering is frightening because of our fear that it will lead to the end of our physical body or the thing which we call self. Therefore, the fear of suffering is only an extension of our fear of death. When we fear suffering, we fear the experience of being afraid of death, or the end of self, even though we may not be completely conscious of this fear. All suffering is merely the perception of threat to either our physicality or to our self. If we can let go of this illusion of self, our suffering ends, at least theoretically. It's just too bad that there is no chapter in the Tao Te Ching that covers letting go of the self. Oh wait a second, there is, and we've covered it already in chapter 13. In order to break this down, I'm going to re-read the excerpt from chapter 13 that we referred to earlier, but I'm going to tack on the rest of the passage with it. What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body which I call myself. If I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me? Therefore, he who would administer the kingdom, honoring it as he honors his own person, may be employed to govern it. And he who would administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be entrusted with it. In the chapter 13 video, we define true love as the ability to take someone else as a part of yourself, to conflate their needs and best interests with your own needs and best interests. Reaching a state where one has this degree of love for all things is the state of oneness, where the illusion of self begins to disappear. Now I do want to clarify a couple of things about this though. First of all, I do want to establish that it is not reasonable to beat yourself up if you're not currently in this state, which let's be honest, you probably aren't. I certainly know I'm not. After all, separation is the great illusion of this life. Our perception of separation is literally baked into our culture, our upbringing, even our biology. This means that learning to find this state of oneness, or true love for all things, is an endeavor that will likely last a lifetime or maybe even more. You can't force this to happen either. You have to learn it, and learning takes time. The next thing I want to say is that it is not my opinion that the transcending of all suffering is possible in this life. Now things do get a little controversial when we try to decide what a good person is, but let's say for the purpose of this video that if our goal is to attain oneness with all things, and that the process of doing this involves learning disinterested love for all things, and if disinterested love causes a person to speak, think, and act benevolently, which it often does, then we can establish a sort of tentative framework for a good person, if I can be so black and white as to call it that. With this tentative framework in mind, I'll just say this. In my observation, the best people I have known throughout history and in my personal life, that is to say, those people who were and are possessed with the highest degree of love and compassion for others, are the ones who are most likely to be the most successful in their lives. If you're not one of those people, then you are not the best person. If you're not one of those people, then you are not the best person. If you're not the best person, then you are not the best person. If you're not the best person. If you're not the best person, then you are the best person. By attaining higher degrees of oneness, acceptance, and disinterested love, a person can learn to experience suffering in a different way. They can learn to appreciate it for what it is, and can bear it cheerfully and peacefully. Certainly to such a person, death itself is nothing to be feared whatsoever. I do hope this video was helpful, and please just keep in mind that this is all just my opinion. And with that, I will see you all tomorrow for chapter 17. Thanks for watching. Peace and blessings.",

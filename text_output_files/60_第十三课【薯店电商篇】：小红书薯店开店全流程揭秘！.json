声音画面还有我的人像都正常吗? 我今天又是个小头出现了。 今天又是个小小头出现了。 正常对吧?嗯,好,可以叫一下其他朋友们进来了哈。 那个助教老师通知一下大家,通知一下大家开始讲了哈。 好好好,我们开始上课了,朋友们抓紧进来。 好,发在群里面,发在群里面。 好,今天的那个内容我先预告一下啊,就是。 嗯。 嗯,如果说你们之前没有干过电商的话,第一次听,可能会觉得那个有点难,但实际上不难,就是操作两下就熟了。 我自己算下来哈,就如果说,因为我们之前教大家一直都是个人IP向的,如果说你自己个人IP都能干好,你干这个电商我觉得是降维打击。 因为说实话,就咱们干那个IP还是原创对吧,还是原创,要真人出镜这个那个的,要写文案。 你像现在你干电商,这个真的就是巨简单,因为相当于就是不用原创。 嗯,我忘了,可以抄,可以光明正大的抄,只是说有点技巧的情绪,就是去抄。 所以说如果大家那个原来是干过个人IP的,再去做一个电商号,或者是后面要转型到电商,对你的难度其实是降低的哈。 所以今天讲的内容呢,是关于一些开店的流程的,然后我们大家进来的怎么样了,我们刷一波888,我们就开始吧。 内容还挺多的哈,大家刷一波888,我们就开始。 好的。 嗯。 好嘞,然后我们就来开了哈。 嗯,今天听课的同学们,你们,你们那个,问问哈,你们,你们做个人IP的扣1,然后做,将来想,想做那个电商的扣2,如果两个都想做的话,扣1和2。 做个人IP的扣1,做电商的扣2,都想做的扣1和2,大部分都是,都想做是吧,因为确实这个是风口啊,如果你们都想做,我觉得蛮好的。 因为这个个人IP它有周期,就是比如说。 我们今天招完了一波训练营,开营了。 那么,呃,下一波可能就两个以后,但,对吧,那中间这段时间呢,除了交付干啥呢,对不对,大家就可以做个自己的号码,可以做个自己的号。 好,我们就来正式开始讲了哈,今天咱们算是那个训练营的第13课,然后同时我们魂馆的四档也可以来听哈。 那这个就是关于小网术开店的全流程,呃,这个内容我们大概是要讲三节,是一节可是肯定讲不完的,因为电商这个板块还是比较大的哈,我们就来今天先开始讲一些,呃,前置的东西。 我跟大家备课的时候是按照那个逻辑去备课,啊,就按照大家接受一个新事物的一个逻辑去备课哈,所以我们讲的是,呃,是有潜入深的。 那我先说一下鼠店,大家现在知不知道鼠店,首先这个鼠店这个词对你来说陌不陌生,呃,如果你知道鼠店的话扣一,不知道鼠店的话扣二。 知道了是吧,已经知道了,好,那么鼠店它的作用是什么呢?鼠店说白了就是个小商店,对吧,就是个挂在你的那个,挂在你账号上的一个小商店。 那么它如果对于卖货的人来说,啊,你经营你鼠店的逻辑叫电商逻辑。 啊,如果你是卖货的,你经营你的鼠店就完全按照电商逻辑来讲,就是说我就是为了卖产品,然后赚利润。 嗯,好,这是这整个电商的哈,如果说,呃,对于卖课的同学来说,啊,对于我们这种个人IP项目的同学来说,那么鼠店对你的作用就是知识付费逻辑。 它上面呢就是用来挂一个低价引流课,或者是直接挂证券。 证券证客的大家直接去我那个小说的主页上去看,那个里面我就挂了两个产品,一个是我们训练营的那个正价产品,一个是那个九块九的引流产品。 对吧,那我挂它的目的是干嘛呢? 这是为了在我的笔记里面把它挂上,然后通过笔记直接直接去转化竞争有效客户,对吧? 所以这是两个逻辑哈,对于卖货的人来说,大家按电商逻辑,呃,对于卖客人来说,你直接挂一个你的课就完了。 好,那我们今天重点讲的是哪一项的呢?我们重点讲的是电商这个板块的,也就是说我们要卖货是怎么卖? 啊,卖货是怎么卖?尤其我们今天重点讲的是电商逻辑板块下的无货源,因为电商是这个样子哈,你挂货对不对? 那有的同学他有自己的货,那么你们就不叫无货源了,你们叫纯电商,也就是卖自己的产品。 那么无货源是什么呢?就是我卖别人的产品。 所以这个本质差别在这儿哈,是看你卖自己的产品还是卖别人产品。 这个就是呃,我们今天电商板块的一个内容。 那电商板块我们今天主要讲的就是你卖别人的货,对吧?开属电卖别人的货,这个就叫无货源电商。 说白了就这个意思,对吧?无货源电商,就我不押货嘛。 那什么是无货源呢?我跟大家再科普一下。 那无货源,其实说白了就是说,我从其他的平台去找那个货,我自己不进货,不押货,不囤货,不投钱。 我就是挂一个链接,你下单了,然后我悄悄的从第三方平台去给你发货,然后赚一个差价。 这个就是无货源,它赚钱的本质。 然后我跟大家仔细的去演示一下,今天我刚刚录的一段视频,我是拿了两个类目去做举例。 你们看完之后,你们大概就知道啊,这个无货源,到底它是一个赚钱,赚到什么程度。 就我自己今天在做的时候,我在想,哎呀,真的那个那个,我要是团队人才多一点,是不是还可以再搞个新业务。 确实很赚钱,确实很赚钱啊。 就它做好了之后,是比如果说你是个小IP啊,你甚至赚电商的钱是要大过你的收入的啊。 它可能不一定让你能够干过。 那种大IP,但它是有可能是比那种小IP要赚钱的。 大家来听一下啊,你们听听看有没有声音。 这个是我录的一个视频啊。 大家看一下有声音吗? 选了连一群这个品牌,连一群夏天比较多嘛。 打完连一群之后,点商品,然后点销量,就代表什么呢? 对吧,有声音,好,我把这个放大哈,我放大。 我放大,然后大家再看哈。 好。 然后来,接下来跟大家举个例子啊。 比如说我们选的连一群这个品类,对吧,连一群夏天比较多嘛。 打完连一群之后,然后点商品,然后点销量,就代表什么呢? 在这个连一群在整个小红书上,对吧,销量排名前几的一些单品。 你看这个裙子,对吧,卖了两万,这个卖了一万,这个卖了一万,这个卖了一万。 那我们就看看啊,到底五货元是怎么赚钱的。 比如说我看中了是这条,对吧,假设我上了这条链接,那么你看看啊,它卖了多少分? 两,九千多单,对吧,然后卖的价格是八十九块九。 好,那我们去别的平台上搜一下,你就知道了。 怎么做啊,先截图,截完图,我们打开平息这个软件。 好,打开这个软件之后,点这个小相机,看到了吗? 然后选择图片,就选择你刚刚截的那个图就可以了,它就会自动定位,自动定位出来之后点销量。 也就相当于这个就是那个按图搜款嘛,就任何一个平台你都可以这样嘛,就是你在路边看到什么好看的了,你截个图,你截就是。 直接搜,按图片搜它就可以出来,对吧。 那好,这个是不是出来了? 那我们看一下哈,在小红书上同一个品,同一个品,同一个模特,对吧。 然后卖多少钱?八十九块九,好。 实际上在平息上拿货价是多少?二十六块八毛九,这就是他们在拿货的价,二十六块八毛九,好。 然后我们看一下哈,那怎么赚钱呢?是不是,你看,是不是就是换个平台,仅仅就是换个平台而已,它就从八十九块九到二十六块八毛九,好吧。 我们算一下,八十九块九减去二十六块八毛九。 这是一个单品的价格,一个单品的差价它能赚的利润,对吧,是不是六十三块,对吧。 那么如果我在小红书上,如果我在小红书上,看一下它卖了多少单,这个小红书上嘛,它卖了九千二百四十四,好。 乘以九千二百四十四,乘以九千二百四十四,看一下。 这个钱数,花张就是如果我卖这个绿色连衣裙在小红书上卖爆了之后,我的肠胃流量,对吧,给我的这个瓶打爆了之后,我能带来的一个营收。 那么就是我的利润,单品的利润。 乘以我的销量,对不对,我单品的利润越高,我的差价越高,我卖的越多,销量越高,我最后赚的钱也越多,对吧。 所以你看,就是换了个平台嘛,八十九块九,二十六块八毛九,就是一个差价,再乘以销量,就完了,对吧,就是一个五十八万,好。 这个就是我们拿连衣裙举个例子,好。 好,刚刚那个视频是我给大家去演示了一下,大家能不能get到,这个方法上课是不是很爽,就是我不用现场给你来回切换,我直接录好,然后这样的话又能看文稿。 然后又能看这个视频,然后又能看这个东西。 好,有同学问了非常好的一个问题,叫什么? 刚刚有同学问一个非常好的问题,我来解答一下。 有同学问,说,李雪问,老师有个疑问,为啥别人不去拼机计价单呢,这么透明? 好,这个问题有没有人能回答出来? 为什么别人不去拼机计价单呢,这么透明? 有人能回答出来吗? 这个东西我告诉大家。 理由是什么啊? 就是商业,商业的本质就是信息差,商业的本质就是信息差。 因为折叠中国,知道吧? 就是,就是折叠,就比如说你去你家门口,你去你家门口的商场里,商场里边,好,它一个连衣裙是不是要卖到三百多? 那有一天是不是你在逛商场的时候,或者是在看电影看完之后,吃完饭之后,顺便逛了个商场,然后逛了商场就觉得这个连衣裙好好看啊,上身一世,说哇,真不错。 然后就, 二九九你就直接买了就回家了,对吧? 但是呢? 但是呢? 难道这个东西它就只二九九吗? 它不能搜图,然后再去别的地方拿货源,然后再去找吗? 但是我告诉大家,很多根本就不知道怎么找,对不对? 根本就不知道怎么找,所以这个是核心问题,因为信息,信息是有信息差的,就比如说我看一个,我看一个那个手机壳,比如说一个透明手机壳,我在那个晚上睡觉前我刷那个小红书,我顺带就看到了,然后它就卖十九块钱或者卖二十块钱。 对我来说,我就是二十块钱我就买了,我觉得还行,我就买了,我没有必要自己再去全网比价,再去到处去找,而且有的时候一些客户他并不知道怎么找,明白了吧? 很多人他就不用评计,甚至你说评计评多多,他不知道,他也不知道有拍图搜款这个功能,他也不知道怎么去找爆款,所以这个就是本质差别,无货源赚的就是信息差,并不是所有的都是公开透明的,就是你知道的他不知道,说白了就是你知道的他不知道。 有些客户甚至觉得呢,他在评计新买,或者他觉得评计箱有的图太low了,对不对?那可能在小红书上我们那个好的标题或者好的封面,然后让他觉得,哎,这儿还挺不错的,下单挺爽的,对吧? 所以这个就本质区别啊,就是你自己想想你直接从货源地你去比价,你去拿货,你找到一个靠谱的货源,他只需要通过你的笔记被你种草去下单,所以它是两个逻辑,这个用户在刷你笔记的时候被种草了,他就买了,他并不一定他就要把这个图又截下来,又去全网去找。 有的客户他不想这么麻烦,尤其是小红书上的用户,他并不是为了一个省三块钱,五块钱会全网比价的一个用户,所以这个是本质区别啊,这个就是本质区别。 好,来,我来再跟大家举个例子啊,这个是联谊群,这个是联谊群,我们再来看一个别的,比如说还有一个点,还有一个点,就是为什么他不去,比如说你搜一个同款,你是不是全网能搜到各种各样的同款,那么你知道该在哪下单吗? 你是不是也不知道,就像我啊,我有的时候我搜一个耳环,我在这家店可能, 69块钱,我觉得我就要买了,我一截图我也会搜,我也会搜,当我全网一搜,乱七八糟的什么价位都有,我就不知道该怎么买了,然后我也懒得去到处去对比,对吧? 那我可能就看这个销量还不错,我就在这家店就买了算了,对吧?我也懒得去对比了,所以这个就是一个本质的区别。 那么后面啊,明天我会告诉大家,你怎么去,你怎么去辨别这些市场上的哪些货源是值得你作为源头,源头渠道的,对吧? 那你去搜的时候也是一堆呀,你怎么去看呢? 到时候有不同的那个方法啊,可能有五个方法,到时候我跟大家说一下,比如说你怎么看它的销量,怎么看它的评价,然后怎么判断它这个货源靠不靠谱等等啊,等等各方面的原因,我到时候跟大家下一个课去说。 所以你看,其他的客户他是不知道这些方法的,对吧?所以他不会去判断,那么我们相当于就是掌握了这个信息差,我们自己帮他去判断,所以这个就是一个区别啊。 然后我这个是拿那个,刚刚是拿啥举例子的,然后我们刚刚,我们再举个例子啊,再举个例子。 比如说项链,对吧? 项链,商品销量。 排名前几的哈,这个就是那个项链,再给大家举个别的品类的,比如说项链,对吧? 项链,商品销量,排名前几的哈,这个就是那个项链类目下,在小红书上卖的比较火的一些品类啊,就这些品类,就这些品类。 好,那我们往下看哈,嗯,你看都卖一万多单,一万多单,比如说我想,我觉得这个还蛮好看的,对吧?卖了三万份,那我们看一下,实际上它能赚多少钱呢? 我们截个图,对吧?然后一样的,来这搜一下。 好,点这个,点这个相机,点左下角,然后把你刚刚截的图选中,它就自动识别了,对吧?你看,这个就是在,如果在这个平台拿货,如果在这个平台拿货,它是多少钱,对吧?在这个平台拿货,它是多少钱? 啊,看一下,可能这个价格才一块七,啊,才一块七,好,然后我们看一下它卖多少钱?它卖十五块九,对吧?标四十九卖十五块九,那会赚多少钱呢?算一下,算一下。 十五块九,对吧?标四十九卖十五块九,那会赚多少钱呢?算一下,算一下。 十五块九减一块七,十五块九减一块七,好,这是它一个品,要赚十四块钱。 它在小红书上卖了多少单呢?看一下,卖了三万单,对吧?卖了三万嘛,这儿,三万单,好,乘以三万。 好,这是四十六万,啊,这个就是四十二万六千,四十二万六千,这个就是,这个品如果上架到小红书上,被打包之后,对吧?我一个单子赚上个十几块钱,我卖了三万份,那么我最终我就能赚到四十二万块钱。 六,这么多,对吧?所以啊,这个就是整个无货员的打法,就是通过中间商赚差价,这样的模式,同时再加上我们的内容杠杆,把这个品打包,然后通过这个差价再乘以销量,最终就等于你的盈利。好,这个就是无货员的一个打法。 好,这个我说完了哈,你看,这个就是整个无货员打法,然后下一个,呃,我们也会告诉大家,就是你们选品的时候要注意什么?呃,比如说啊,有的带logo的,或者是有的带那个黑标的,对吧?就不能选,或者是, 呃,比如说香奈儿的呀,呃,迪奥的呀,这种,呃,品牌的,那你就不能选,那你选的就是一些没有商,就是无品牌的东西,说白了就是大家都能卖。 说白了,全世界的货可能都是从义乌那拿的,大家就在这,呃,各种平台上,各种地方去卖,有的人在线下卖,有的人在线上卖,有的人在这个平台卖,有的人在那个平台卖,所以大家做无货员选的是这些品类,知道吧? 啊,好,关于怎么,呃,买回来拍图,这个东西我在下一课再去讲哈,我先跟大家说,你们先最开始阶段不用买货。 呃,就是你还没挣钱的时候先不用买货,先用那个素材二次剪辑,然后去做,然后做完了之后等你出单了,比如说我已经赚了三百块钱了,已经有,呃,十个顾客下单了,我赚了三百块钱了,这个时候我再花个几十块钱,我去买一个正,买一个品,回来验一验这个品是不是好的,对吧? 或者是比如说我看了十家店铺,我我看了十家店铺,我觉得都不错,那我们就全部统一下单,下单之后我回来就十家店铺比较一下啊,可能这家店铺是最好的,而这家店铺的那个货和版是对的的,对吧? 我留下他以后我用这家店铺作为我的上游渠道,其他的我就全退回去,对吧?啊,这个就是你赚钱以后你可以去做,然后拍实图呢,我也不建议你开始拍,因为无货员他打法,比如说啊,他不是上一个品,他可能上二十个品,那么你二十个品呢,那都要买回来,都要自己去拍吗? 个人IP那一套了,对吧?个人IP就是说我自己原创,我自己生产,但是无货员的打法,它是铺量的模式,它是铺量大量选品,大量上,然后哪一个出单算哪一个,对吧?有可能你上了十个,其中只有一个报了,那么你以后你就是重点去做这一个,你把那一个再拿回来,然后再好好拍,然后再穿插着来,对吧? 所以这是后面的时候啊,但是一开始你不需要上来,就每一个图都自己拍,不需要,知道吧?你看这些有什么侵权吗?这个这个这个全网都是用的这个图,知道吧?全网都是用这个图,哈,这两张图我就展示了 整个一个是怎么怎么去操作的哈,然后我再让大家看一看,你看小红书上现在已经陆陆续续开始无货员了哈,呃,信号是不是发第一个就发无货员,对对对,是的啊,就是你发就行了,然后你看这个是呃,这两个算,你看啊,这个这个就笔记哈,这个是我跟大家说那个货品怎么去去看的哈,这个是怎么通过笔记带货,就是他自己做完一篇笔记之后配上一个文案,通过内容杠杆把这个流量撬爆了之后,然后就有人通过他这篇笔记直接点下面的购物车去下单 你看这个就是一个奶酪的 你看就是三个图片看到了吧三张图片然后呃售出了一千一千三百多单假设一单的利润是五块那么他这一个卖了就卖了赚了五千好再看这个 这个也是三张图吧也是三张图 啊也是三张图加上几行字然后卖了1.2万好假设他这个利润是五块啊或者是三块对吧那他可能靠这个品 一个 赚了四五万啊但是我跟大家说一点哈就他赚的这四五万不是通过一篇笔记报的大家能明白吗他是挂在他的店铺上他的店铺累积销量 1.3万他有可能是发了十片二十篇笔记达到的这个销量 这个点大家能明白吗不是说一篇一篇笔记挂了一个购物车然后他就这一篇笔记帮他带了1.3万不是的他是反反复复在卖反反复复在卖 这个大家能懂吗就相当于我挂一个我的小课我一篇笔记挂了个小课也不是说我就靠着一篇 笔记把我的所有的小课卖出去我是每次更新作品我都挂每次更新我都挂这个大家能懂吧好然后再看另一个这个是一个睡衣的 对好几条笔记都带同一个产品你看这是一个睡衣的你看就是三四张图四五张图 四五张这个应该是他不是从别的平台来的他可能就属于实拍了就我自己买回来自己实拍的 也不错你看销量2000将近3000将近3800块钱他可能拿货价30 五十块钱的五十块钱的利润乘以一个乘以一个将近多少单3000单那大家可以算一下是多少钱 对吧好然后这几张都是那个图片的哈这张都是图片的 这三个都是图文的形式然后这个呢是视频形式大家再看一下哈这个是视频形式大概是一个15秒好15秒那个视频 过来 来 来 要的 这 这个销量是个6000单销量6000单29块钱我估计拿货价可能也就12块钱左右吧我们假设10块钱就就算少点哈假设差价10块钱 他这一个品也给他带来5万块钱的营收了将近6万块钱的营收好吧这个就是整个一个无货源那个现状就是整个在平台上现在做的人比较少 好吧那无货源适合什么样的人呢啊主要适合 第三类人 啊第一类人就是我们在学院很多很多学院里面就是我们之前交付大家也也很痛苦的一个点就是什么呢我们也教了怎么做流量了也教了这个那个了但是他就一直赚不到钱或者是一直没办法做出成绩原因是在哪呢 原因就是他第一不想露脸第二又没特长 这些人呢他 走那个ip的路他就很难走对不对你像你如果说你本身英语老师啊你就这个老师那个老师那你肯定可以随便做吗但有的同学他第一他不露脸他就不想露脸第二他又没有毫无特长 然后第三他又不想做ip他又做不了知识付费那么他就比较适合去干的是什么呢现在就有个新的办法适合大家去做就是无货源你不想露脸你想比如说看孩子的时候或者上班下班 回到家的时候对吧你就可以去做无货源剪剪视频二次剪辑一下然后快快快去发一下这个就比较快 好就第一类人第一类人第二类人什么呢就是我自己本身你就买买买你本身最买买买就感兴趣你自己没事干的时候都喜欢刷 所以这个对这个东西对你来说是一件你的日常就比如你就喜欢耳丁那你就做一个那个视频类目的对吧你就做个视频类目的 你自己就喜欢买买买对电商本身都感兴趣的人那还适合什么呢就是我自己没货 我自己家没货然后我也不想投钱压货的那么就适合干务会员啊那像我们很多的创始人ip可能他本身自己就是视频主理人呀 是这个服装主理人那他可能不需要去做无货源他直接就做电商就可以了那如果大家没有自己的货你们就只能卖别人的货了吗对吧 那卖别人的货不就是无货源吗所以这个就比较适合这三类人去干哈 卖什么东西是有什么诀窍吗就选自己喜欢的呃我会跟大家推荐几个类目吧推荐几个类目啊然后嗯 关键还是什么呢一个自己喜欢另外一个就是你对这个类目比较熟悉啊比如说你自己就是一个从来呃 从来不怎么买衣服的人你自己就是个从来不怎么买衣服的人然后你做那个那个女装类你是不是就比较比较难因为你就不知道 什么是当下的流行款你就不知道哎今年流行新中式了吗今年流行这个那个的你就没那个感觉 没那个感觉你做起来就稍微有点点难对吧所以尽量就是从自己自己擅长的内幕出发吧另外也可以多多个类目多做哪个做起来算哪个吗 好然后我接下来再往后说哈就为什么要做无货源也就是整个无货源的一个优势好 这个现在大家能看清楚吗这个我的这个思维导图大家能看清吗 能看清吗能看清大家可以截个图哈截个图发在我们的 红人馆的群里面或者是发在我们训练营群里面大家可以打一波哈如果听完有收获的话可以打一波 收获满满好不好 大家可以打在红人馆的群里面然后打一波收获满满打不收获满满回来接着再听调动一下啊打在我们的那个红人馆的或者是训练营的群里面 打在红人馆和训练群里面 调动一下其他没听课的同学哈让他们觉得哎不听浪费了对不对 对不对好那个 啊一一一停一停打了好大家可以打一波然后我们接着往下讲哈 无货源的优势有哪些哈首先第一个就是我们先从整个平台整个小红书的趋势来看 啊小红书趋势第一个就是他消费能力比较强这个大家应该都已经很熟悉了 人群二十到三十五岁然后一二线的高知女性群体对吧 所以也印证了我前面 说的那个点就是这一波人他本身就不不想去比价他就没那个时间去比价 知道吧他不是不是说收割这种嗯买个三五块钱要搞那个要搞钱要搞那个像买菜的时候 搞个几毛钱的这这些群体他不是说是收割的是妈妈群体啊什么的 他的面相用户群体就是这些高知群体高知用户女性群体我之前不跟大家举例子吗董洁的直播间平均的成交额是在3000 一个用户一晚上要在他的直播间花 三块钱这很夸张的对不对所以他会为了一个耳钉19块钱还是12块钱去到处比价吗他不会的对吧他不会的 好这是一个消费能力强所以他不擅长比价那么就是我们的我们去比价对吧我们去做比价那么第二个什么呢就平台基因好 因为平台他要完成种草到拔草的一个全面的站内闭环那么第三个点就是什么呢 平台在大量扶持电商因为我之前说过很多次之前他一直都是扶持的是内容内容内容但他没有电商 先说他就没有这样的这个想说这个这家公司他的盈利就不是很高就没有抖音高所以呢他要做的一个趋势战略就是说我要把电商扶持起来 所以呢他开始往直播间导流他开始往挂车的作品里面去导流他开始给各种店铺的红利不适合你啊就是不不查你这个不查你那个什么也能上架对吧 就是为了平台睁一只眼闭一只眼什么是红利呢什么是红利啊就是开始睁一只眼闭一只眼这个就叫红利什么东西都可丁可卯的都是那种东西 有一是一说一是一的这个时候就已经很难了就是你但凡上一个东西你又要品牌又要资质又要背书啊又要这个你你纳税又要这个什么 各种担保保证金一堆什么证件的齐全的时候他就没有普通人的红利了知道吗红利的意思就是他平台不适合你那么严谁都能做 所以才是红利嘛对吧所以现在就是一个红利期那么第四个原因什么呢就是专业选手少 因为 绝大部分的 人还是在卷抖音还是在卷抖音所以呢整个商家的平台他们大部分会把自己的核心团队力量放在抖音上 所以就导致小红书上的店家是比较少的 小顺电家比较少然后整体的专业选手比较少所以他竞争比较少如果大家想象一下啊如果是某一那帮人不干了 某一那帮人全面不干了一口饭都吃不到了这帮人意识到抖音已经不赚钱的时候他们开始把团队 就全部迁移到某双的时候这个时候正规军来了啊各种挂车的各种操作各种运营团队全上的时候 普通人就没有机会了现在就是因为人家这波人还在别的平台吃那个另一个平台的肠胃流量呢人家还没吃完那波呢对吧所以人家看不上想说这块蛋糕 人家要做到上亿的节目一会人家做到几千呢还看不上小红书呢这个时候小红书上这个小蛋糕是不是咱们就可以先吃起来了 对吧所以这个是比整个平台的一个趋势哈那么接下来我再说第二个点就是 投资成本低投资成本低低他不像某宝对吧你上个品需要你刷单啊什么的第一你不需要刷单 第二你不需要任何的投流第三你不需要任何的压货零投入对吧啊还有什么 保证金极低保证金都不要求你上万了吗这个那个的保证金只需要一千就可以开店了而且前期可以不交 等你要体现的时候啊等你要体现的时候 再去补交或者是你的店铺盈利已经非常高的时候官方要提醒你去补齐你的证件的时候你再去交 所以说他可以说是起电起电几乎零成本这个在全网都没有 全网都没有好吧啊全网都没有所以投资成本低大家可以打一波投资成本低 那评论区大家可以打一波叫投资成本低 好打完之后我们再接着往下走哈好第三个什么呢我会呢优势掉 风险低啊风险低也就是目前整个 我就跟大家说了吗整个平台就在睁一只眼闭一只眼你只要不什么违法乱纪太严重他都不管你的他都不管你的 对吧啊所以平台他是几乎没有违规性罚款顶多他就会判断你什么呢说 你什么什么什么啊你违规了你要提醒一下你对吧提醒一下你 他不会说给你罚款什么直接给你关店直接给你扣押金直接给你罚款这个那个的没有 他顶多就是给你后台谈个消息说你一个产品被下架了因为哪哪哪哪哪不合规然后那个过大过度宣传了或者是啊用了别人的logo了这个那个的对吧 他可能只会这样子嗯啊所以说他是没有任何罚款的啊没有任何的罚款的你只要就是在正常的这个合法范围内经营 没有太大幺蛾子的情况下都不管你都不管你啊另外一个什么呢就回款周期短啊回款周期比较短替加期这个用户他收获之后七天你就可以去提现了 了所以他回款周期是很短的很快你就可以开始周这个资金的周转啊这是第三个点号叫风险低来大家打下第三个叫风险低风险低好第四个 大家打一波啊风险低然后我们再说第四个 啊第四个叫什么呢运营难度低 运营难度低就是我刚开头就说了个人ip再去做电商的时候是降维打击因为对我们来说 从一个选题到一个文案到一个标题到一个封面到我们所有的视频 全部是自己原创但是做电商的做做那个什么无货源的你是不需要做原创的 你是几乎不需要原创的你原创你就已经是啊要给你竖个大木格了啊你不原创是很正常的对吧 所以他就是笔记的素材搬运再加上二次剪辑啊各种混减呀还有用一些剪辑手法去规避平台的审核呀 等等这种去操作的你几乎不需要原创甚至标题都可以用照我们那种什么柔和法对吧你可以素材用a的然后呢 那个标题用个c的对吧然后揉一揉揉成你的一片 啊因为这种因为这种电商类的他说白了他不像个人ip有有明确的这种ip属性在里边他其实就是卖货的卖卖货的对吧所以他没有那么强的那种对你原创的要求度 好这个就是我们整个无货源的一个优势哈 就笔记搬运二次剪辑不需要原创以及风险低投资成本低还有这个平台的基因好 好那么我们在做无货源的时候需要哪些环节呢啊如果做无货源的话 你是不是整个从一个链路来链路上来讲的话需要这些环节对吧第一 你要做无货源首先要开店对不对好开完店了是不是要选品了我要上哪个品啊上这个手机壳还是这个手机壳我是不要选了好第二步叫选品选品之后要干嘛 要上架对吧就第三步上完架要干嘛呢是不是就要开始发笔记了发笔记的时候通过笔记去挂车 发笔记 发笔记然后挂车对吧然后挂完车之后 有了效 有了这个曝光了有人在你店铺下单了是不是你就要开始对接商家去进行售后了这个就是我们的一个全流程 那我接下来就会围绕这个全流程 就跟大家去讲今天我们重点讲怎么开店以怎么上架然后下次上课我们可能要讲怎么去选品选品很重要以及怎么发笔记 怎么做原创或者委员创的笔记对吧然后再可能再再有节课跟大家讲怎么去 跟商家去谈单子呀怎么跟商家去售后呀乱七八糟一些收尾工作好这个就是我们的整体的逻辑哈 个人ip 我们当时说过吧个人ip和无货源是两个号吗没有什么影响呀两个号呀不在同一个号里你不能说同同时我是个个人ip交做自媒体的同时我那个店铺里 同时我的那个号上还今天卖个牙刷明天卖个那个吧不行哈电商号就是电商号ip号就是ip号两个号明白了吧 好嗯然后我们接下来说了哈整个无货源电商需要哪些环节我们紧急就要来跟大家说了我们先说第一个环节要开店好我来问一下 那我们最好什么时候开店呢现在就可以开呀你开信号之后就可以开店了好呃你们已经开店的口译还没有开店的口号我看一下 都还没开吗 都还没开好来让你看一下哈好我们来说一下开店的流程这个开店流程来跟大家说一下整个整个怎么弄哈 哎哎哎 我来把它点开好这个时候会清晰一点不哎这个上课是不是很爽又可以看到我又可以看到又可以看到后面 好来跟大家说一下哈 啊小红书店铺它其实整个大类来分就分两类一个是个人店一个企业店企业店我不建议大家用哈我们用最多还是个人店 然后说一下个人店个人店的话我们身份证如果是你是那个个体店的话就个人店的话身份证注册当天注册当天过啊然后你的小红书面 称就是你的店铺名你的小红书名称就是你的店铺名我来退出一下大家看一下啊如何开鼠店我们先看一下如何开鼠店哈这个大家还会操作了吗这个会操作了吗如何开鼠店 点你的左上角然后看创作中心 创作中心然后点更多服务然后点开通店铺看到了没有创作中心点进去之后更多服务这儿这儿完了之后点开通店铺是不是进行到这个页面了没有要求没有要求就要这个页面了 是不是啊然后再看一下这个页面我放大一点好这个页面就涉及到了不同的类型了好看一下有哪些点好是不是有个人点 个人点你就只需要身份证就可以了还有哪个个体工商户点

Do you remember? When you first registered, did you say something like little sweet potato? Let me see. Thank you. Thank you. I'll have to talk about this later. I'm out of battery. Okay, I'm back. I'm back. I'm back. Okay, now it's just the light. Okay, the computer is charged. Okay, everyone, wait a minute. Let's call another 666. Everyone just waited a moment. I'll talk about it later. Let's call another 666. Let's talk about it later. Okay, I'll talk about it later. Maybe my person will be a little dark. Okay, everyone, do you know that after you open a store, you will have a certain power. For example, you are called Yaya. Then your store will be called Yaya. Right? So everyone should pay attention. You must change your name when you call. Otherwise, you may be called little sweet potato. What 6415926 something. Right? Then you will be a little sweet potato 123456789 store. Do you think people will order in this store? No. So your name must be changed to a professional name. Then to increase your conversion rate. You know, right? For example, if you make a video, you can call it an Aichi video. Right? If you do the same makeup, you can write the same makeup wholesale supply chain. Right? In this case, people will point at you. Is it more likely? Can you order in your store? Can you understand this point? Then I will show you. Look, for example, what is this person called? You see, for example, this person is not called. You see, this person is not called Aichi video. See? Right? So his store is called Aichi Video Shop. Then you see what this person is called. This name is more perfect. What is this called? This is called the same makeup wholesale supply chain. See? His own name is called the same makeup wholesale supply chain. If it were me, I would choose this makeup girl, the same makeup wholesale supply chain, right? Or what is the video source supply chain? As long as your name is not illegal, you can go up and call this name. Then others point at your account, right? You call what what what supply chain. Then you point at your store. You call the same makeup wholesale supply chain. Do you feel great at once? Do you just want to order from this store? You think, oh, you see, the supply chain must be cheap, right? Is it just this feeling? This is the advantage of the name. The advantage of the name is that it can create a name with a conversion rate. Just go and create a conversion rate. So I said the e-commerce account and the personal IP account. It's just two different things. Can you understand this? It feels like the beginning, doesn't it? It feels like a shop that can be very popular, right? Okay, and then this point. I'm here. What is the point you should pay attention to? You have to go to the little red book first. Search for the name. Is there a repetition? For example, you want to call that Aichi Video. Then you have to search in that search box. Search for Aichi Video and then point at a user. After the user is finished, If the whole network has the same name, You have to modify it. Why? Although the little red book number can be the same name, But the store can't be the same name. For example, it's impossible to say that there are two stores in the small red book. It's called the same shop wholesale supply chain at the same time, right? It can only have one. If A has written this name, You can't write it anymore. Can you understand this? If there is already a store called Aichi Video, You can't call it. So when you call your little red book name, You just go to search for Aichi Video. Is there a similar user? If there is, you change the name. If you want to be exactly the same as others, If you want to register a store again, Your store can't be reviewed. Because there is already a store called Aichi Video. Can you understand this point? Can you get it? Then the system will prompt you to modify it. But you have to modify it for seven days. That is, you can only change your name again after seven days. Think about it. If you don't know, You may have a name. Then apply for it. Then the system will prompt you to modify it for seven days. You submit another one. Then the system will prompt you to modify it for seven days. You say, have you been there for half a month? Is it a big deal? So you have to pay attention. When you start naming, We search in advance. Do you know how to search? Do you know how to search? Can you understand how to search? When you usually search for that name, Search for Aichi Video, Then click on the user. If there is a store called exactly the same as yours, You can't do it. Can you understand this point? Can you understand how to search? If you can understand, Call Aichi Video. The store name can be changed. Can be changed. For example, I say Lulu Shizhilu. Right? Lulu Shizhilu. Then I click on the user. You see, After searching, It's exposed here. No, you can't. After you search, Click on the user. This is the same name as you on the whole network. Right? Look, if you register, Try not to be like others. Right? Just to prevent this problem. Okay, this point reminds everyone. Okay, that's about it. Then the other is the individual business. Then there is the individual business. What else? What else? That's the enterprise store. I don't recommend using enterprise stores. Enterprise stores, for example, What kind of ordinary enterprise stores, Enterprise stores, special stores, and joint stores. It requires you to provide all kinds of procedures and resources. It's troublesome. You must know that Business people are like this. Can do small, don't do big. Why? You do a flagship store, You do a mess, What kind of store? Okay, A fight, a check. First of all, these people go to the cover. No one will care about you if you make a fuss. Can you understand? Close the door and tell everyone. It's a little fight, little trouble. This kind of store, No one cares about you. But if you go to the individual store, What kind of enterprise store, This and that, You may be behind. Sometimes you have to make up for what procedures. Let you pay something, What kind of money, Then you have to check it. Then this and that. Maybe you have to do this. Because everything is big. Right? Grab the big one first. Right? So when you can do small, Go to the small, big, small, Do it quietly. Right? So I don't see anyone using enterprise stores. You just use your own store. That's enough. Just what I just said. This is our大概 A process of opening a store. It's a little bit of a process. The entire opening is done like this. That's enough. You just turn it on. Okay. What do you do after you open the store? To go to the setting. There are a lot of attention to be paid at this time. You see, So much of a mystery. Okay, Everyone, Pay attention at this time. I'll click Tell you. There's a lot of content behind this. Let me tell you. The basic facilities of the background. Take a look at the background of a basic facility. Take a look. What's the first thing? You look at the background. You look at the background. You look at the background. Look at the background. There's a lot of content behind it. You see, There's a lot of information behind it. What is the first thing there is a playback What is the first thing You have to listen to the playback After you finish following up today You still have to listen to me I told you there are a lot of operations behind you Everyone listen to it once It must be a cover First you have to set up your store Your store has been registered After registration Is it necessary to set up the settings in your store? So how to set up First you have to pay the guarantee This is the first 1000 yuan You can not pay in advance But I just pay it directly I just pay it directly Right?

Then at this time he will remind you Right? The amount of money should be paid is 1000 Right? Then you can pay it You can not pay Pay it later But I suggest everyone If you want to do it big Still have to pay it Otherwise, it's not convenient to raise the line or something Anyway, 1000 yuan is like this When you cancel the store He will return it to you He is just a deposit Just a deposit All right He didn't say to you Just deducted 1000 yuan and it was gone Know it Do you know how to do this? Do you know how to do it? Let me show you Look, this is my little red book business management background Then click on this fund See? Then click on the store guarantee See? Okay, this is the page of your store guarantee Know it Know how to operate Just fill it up Then it's over Okay, then I'll talk about it again After the deposit is finished We have to choose a payment method What does the payment method mean? If I buy it at your store Does he support me to use Alipay or WeChat? Right? If you want to open it Right? Payment method Alipay and WeChat Open it up Where does Alipay open up? Let's take a look Still this page Point Point what? Point this fund Then point one I'll take a look Where is this? Payment fund Okay, this is the place Point the payment fund Let me show you Let me show you Okay, this is my page Fund Then point the payment fund See? This is my background My background, right? Payment from the Paypal user Payment with settlement money Payment with settlement money from the WeChat payment user Right? This is going to open Right? To highlight Just click on the highlight Click on the highlight Right? This is your platform Okay, I'll jump back and talk about it Okay, Paypal Paypal is when you open it You can open it after you register Why don't you need this? You pay or not The payment method of this payment Can be opened How to open WeChat? WeChat is like this Open the next day Can't open on the same day That is, after you register the shop today Immediately this user You can pay you with the payment fund But we need to be on the next day He can And what does WeChat require? You have to pay the deposit to open Like me at the time I didn't pay the $1,000 deposit Then I can I'm on the shelf On the shelf, my $9.9 class Then others can buy But he can only pay me through the payment method He can't go through WeChat Then I looked at the background WeChat can't pay I said I'll turn this feature on After I turn this feature on Just After I turn this feature on I can go He can use his WeChat to pay the money directly Right? But everyone pays attention to WeChat You have to pay the deposit to open it If you don't pay the $1,000 deposit He won't allow you to pay WeChat Know that So this is to be noted Another point What do you pay attention to Is that you bind the WeChat account WeChat account and bank account He is the same person as your little uncle's ID What does that mean If it's me My little uncle's account The ID is my ID Then when I open the shop The WeChat account and bank account that reflects the WeChat account Must be my account Can't say it's my shop Then I mentioned it to someone else No It must be all of you You open your own shop You leave your money to yourself This is his unification This is what the price requires Must be bound to the same person If you say you use your parents' ID Then you have to bind the WeChat account WeChat account bank account It must be your parents' account It's the same person The same system Can you cover this? Can you understand this payment method? Can you understand the words of the Kui Bo Can you operate your phone? I suggest you use your computer to operate Anyone who wants to do the project Let's get some attitude out of it Use that computer to operate It's a hassle if you use that phone to operate You know You can also use your mobile phone to operate You can also use your mobile phone to enter through Baidu But it's a hassle The phone interface is too small, isn't it? Including you have to go to the store without a member You have to put the goods on one button Do you still have to use the computer? The mobile phone can also be used But it's a hassle It's a hassle, you know It's still convenient for the computer Know not Can you understand We'll talk about this next This is a risk-free Can you understand If you can understand, Kui Bo 1 Can you understand? Kui Bo 1 good everyone Can you understand Still not Can you understand Can you understand Ok Can you understand OK Can you understand Let's talk about this later This guarantee is over The payment method is over Next, let's talk about the risk of transportation The risk of transportation Everyone who has bought something at Taobao knows It will write behind it This what Bring your own transportation risk Or some of them are in the risk of transportation Not in the risk of transportation Then we as girls If you buy something It must be thinking In case I buy a dress I have to return if it doesn't fit So I suggest This is the function of transportation risk Everyone is best to open Especially what you do What kind of video content What shoes What clothes This is possible In the case of a return Then you have to prevent users from going Worrying about not getting off the list Right So you have to put this The function of transportation risk Open it to him I suggest everyone to open it Then how to open it Everyone goes to this after-sales Then click on the transportation fee That's it Let me show you this picture See no After-sales Then click on the transportation fee Then click on the open full-time service That's it I'll show you I'll show you Log in to my background Okay, this is my background See it See it This is my notebook background Then click on the after-sales Then see it After-sales Then click on a transportation fee See it This is the time Because of my own main account I'm doing knowledge payment I don't need transportation risk If you are that physical Right You are selling goods Then you have to point I agree to read Then open the full-time service That's it So what's the benefit of opening transportation risk? It's very clear here Take a closer look The first one is that you can increase your conversion rate That's what I said There will be doubts when you get off the list If you don't have that If you don't have that return or transportation fee Others may not get off the list Right Maybe you think that I have the same product I'll go to the one with transportation risk And make a reservation So you have to open the first point after opening Is to help you increase the conversion rate You can increase it by about 18% I'll zoom in Can you see it clearly Can increase the conversion rate of 18% What else can I do Can help you increase traffic Because there is a return on the product interface There is a transportation risk mark It will show you first in the search For example, at the same time I search for a video Your family is both on this video Then you have transportation risk You will be in the video interface first To show in this product interface Because the platform is also for I want to show that there is a transportation risk It's better to have sales, right? What else can reduce the dispute Right, reduce the dispute Then pay him seven dollars See, pay him seven dollars Okay, then take a look If you have transportation risk What is the interface like below See this Can you see this clearly If you have transportation risk It will write below Proof of ownership and then return return Or package transportation fee See here Then look this way This seems to be impossible to see If you are in the business interface See no If you have transportation risk It will show you first What else If you hang a shopping cart in the live broadcast room Do you see this If you have transportation risk It will mark it This is also useful in the live broadcast room To convert This is the whole The importance of transportation risk So the transportation risk How to get the specific transportation risk What what what There will be detailed introductions later Anyway What is the大概 It will pay the customer seven yuan Then each order He will have a zero point five cents It seems that you can take a look I don't even have you see If you open it Your estimated service fee is zero point one three yuan Every order It means that you sell one You only need to pay a dime You only need to pay a dime You can open this service Its cost is very low Because I just counted it Maybe a profit You may have a profit Assume there is a profit of fifty dollars You just spend a dime Right Put your transfer rate on it It's worth it It's worth it Okay, let's talk about it later Talk about it later The shipping fee is over Then we talk about this later Okay, let's talk about logistics Okay, let's talk about logistics Logistics is very, very important Listen carefully Logistics is that you have to be in this order Select logistics tools Then fill in your delivery address Just fine It doesn't matter where you send it Just fill in your own You see the order Then click on logistics tools See it? You fill it in Your own address Because it must require you to have a delivery address You like me Even if it's a virtual product I also have to have a delivery address You just have to have it anyway You just fill it in Anyway, you don't send it from your own place But you fill in your own He will think you sent it from this location Can you understand If I fill in Beijing's Haidian District The other party will think If he orders from me I sent it from this address But actually I must have sent it from the source This is the order logistics Then fill in the delivery address Let me show you Again, this order Fill in your order Sent a product Really I collect Here Can you see the order Order Then click on the logistics tools See This is what you can add to your address Then another point What to note Recover address is very important Why is the address of the receiver important Everyone thought Why are the Pure order addresses important Any of you can answer the question Why is the position of the cash pulled down very important Think about it Why is the reverse South power digit is very important This is very important. Think about why. Think about why. Is there anyone who can answer? Why is the return address very important? Retail, you must pay attention to it. Don't give the real address. Because the address of the delivery is different. Right. If you return the address If it's written by yourself Then the user When he bought this product He is not satisfied He will return the goods If he calls that What is that? Shunfeng, come and get it. He will directly return it to you. He will follow the return address Directly return to the original So this return is returned to your hand. Returned to your hand You have to return the original Right, so the return address Be sure not to give the real address Then there is a very clever way. Very this A sloppy point Everyone remember how to do it You want to fill in the address But he can't give a real address What do we do at this time? Come on, give us a very sloppy point. Everyone remember Click on the order Click on the logistics tool Then click this This new address, right? Click on the new return address Did you see it at this time? Contact person still writes himself Ah, and then the mobile phone number is also filled in But but your address does not write your own In order to prevent him from being able to directly return We must give him a wrong address Or not give him an address How do we fill Our national region needs to choose a Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan For example, choose China, Hong Kong Right, China, Taiwan At this time He he certainly wouldn't say I sent that package to Taiwan, right? What is the other one called? Detailed address He doesn't have to write his actual address But to write If you need to return the goods Detailed return address must consult customer service Yes, you can keep your mobile number Um, if he wants to call you If he wants to return the goods He may call you well good Uh, did you see this? This is the most important point One is the address Fill in a Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan address Prevent him from sending it back directly Another detailed address column Detailed address column can't be empty, right? Can't be empty He has a signal Can't be empty Then we will tell him Ah, return the goods Detailed return address Please consult customer service At this time If he wants to return the goods He can't send it directly to you He can only ask the customer service How do I send it Please send me an address Then he sent it You understand this point Okay, what's the other point If you have 10,000 orders Like yours If you have 10,000 orders If there are 1,000 customers giving you a return every day You can't send it to everyone There's another way at this time What's it called Use multiple addresses to return goods Different products You go to connect different top-up return locations Ah, what does it mean He has a strategy for creation Then after creating a strategy You can choose a return address Then you can connect the goods Okay, let me show you Let me show you my background For example, here you see the order Then click logistics tools Isn't this my address This is my delivery address, right? Ah, delivery default or return default You can also choose here So at this time I want to add an address Add address is a return address Just like I just said, right I choose one Ah, what do I choose in China I choose a Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, right? China, Hong Kong Then say Please consult me Right Please consult me What what what Something like that Just like the field I just mentioned After filling in, submit What happens after submitting What happens after submitting After submitting You just put that place Co-select as default return This is the operation we just talked about But if I have too much goods For example, I'm getting older I have sent 10,000 pieces One of them needs to be returned Ah, 10% return rate I want to return 1,000 pieces I go to the dog's head one by one I'm so tired of it Then I have to I have to manually connect it directly A return address, right What can we do Look here There is an option called multiple address return Do you see Multiple address return After clicking on a multiple address return We can click on the creation strategy At this time, I created a strategy For example, AA, right AA and then return address I'll fill in a what what what what what Something like that A default return address What about this return address Is what you want from your supplier For example, your video All the pearls All come from this person Then your return address will fill in this person's Then you go to connect your products, right Put all of them Put all of that All your pearl items All related to Understand? Just as long as you're going to his home Have you seen all your products here? All related, right After connecting Click on one Just click on confirmation In this case If the pearl earring user needs to be returned It will all automatically return to that price Right But if you are the one in the necklace What what butterfly necklace This one, that one, right You imported from B Then you put the B's The return address is created again After creation Go to the link again Right Add products Then connect all the things about that necklace Then click on confirm So you don't need to manually return the goods This point is that everyone understands Our first method is to manually return the goods Let him consult you Then you need to communicate with him manually Come and go There is another method What is it called that we just demonstrated? Multiple address return If I open a video store I have five of them in total One is French Then there is one with earrings One is necklace One is bracelet Right There are a few stores Then I created four addresses You see he can have multiple addresses here He can have multiple addresses here Understand? Multiple address return You can create a lot of houses Create four here Create four return addresses Then connect different products At this time The corresponding product return He will automatically return to the corresponding upper Okay Can you all understand what I'm talking about at this time? Can you catch up? K1 Don't understand? K2 Can you catch up? Can you catch up? Right Right Consulting products customers do it themselves But it has the automatic reply function Need you to buy Even if you spend money to buy No need in the early stage In the early stage, you don't need it when you have one or two orders Unless it's reported Unless you have a big store every day You can't get a lot of orders every day You can buy that information service again Okay, that's when we're done with this delivery Is this only Is it called what? The outside industry looks lively The inside industry looks door-to-door Right Why the same person He can't do it Then why can we do it? This is because there are many little twists in the middle This is our shop setting The shop setting in the background One is about how to pay the guarantee One is about payment methods One is about transportation costs The other is about logistics How to fill Okay, this is the whole thing Can you understand About how to set up this shop If you can follow up here Everyone call 666 If you can all follow up You hit one You hit one There's too much dry goods Then send it to our red-hot restaurant group Send it to our red-hot restaurant group Too much dry goods Okay Everyone send it to the red-hot restaurant group Too much dry goods Then come back and listen again Come back and listen again Let's take a break and talk about it later Too much dry goods You haven't finished this yet There's more to come There's more to come I'm afraid you can't absorb it I'll tell you after three lessons If you finish it all at once You're crazy, you know Okay, is this the whole process? Do you remember what we just talked about? The entire no-purchase source Is the entire no-purchase source designed to open stores Selected products Send notes Then add a no-purchase source At this time, the first part of the opening We're done The first part is over Next, we'll talk about the second part It's called no-purchase That is, you have to no-purchase your products How to no-purchase How to no-purchase First of all, we need to use two tools If you use the computer Just use the web version of the red-hot restaurant management backstage That's what I just operated Yeah Yeah, you're the customer Customer service is you Yeah You're in the backstage If someone orders from the red-hot restaurant management backstage If someone orders from the red-hot restaurant management backstage If someone orders from the red-hot restaurant management backstage He'll have someone He'll find you Wait a minute Let me show you my backstage I can't show you Maybe you can't see it It's your backstage Your backstage needs your own management Okay, if you're on the shelf How do you go to the products?

Hard to operate Especially when you have to go to the store a lot You have a cell phone with 100 products You're tired of the car, aren't you?

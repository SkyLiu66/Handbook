    "data": " To be an artist, and particularly to be a writer, what you are doing is a twofold process. And to put it very simply, it's a process of creating, and then it's a process of fixing or of editing. The first thing you do as a writer is you explode. You explode like a bomb explodes. You explode onto the page. The story is an explosion, and you get to the end of it. And once it's done, then you get to walk around it, and you get to look at the shrapnel and the damage it did, and you get to see who died. And you get to see who died. And you get to see how it worked. And that's the point where you get to think about it. You get to think about what works and what doesn't work. For me, once I've finished writing something, whether it's a short story or a novel or a script, what I do, if I can, is I leave it, walk away, do something else, and then maybe a week later, maybe 10 days later, print it out, come back to it, and try and pretend, and pretend like a method actor. Pretend like this is the most important thing in the world to me. Pretend that I've never read it before, and I know nothing about it. And then I read it. And it's very easy. It gets easier the longer it goes, I think, for me, just to pretend that I've never, I don't know anything about this thing. I'm reading it as best I can as a reader. And I do it, print it out, because I have a pen or a pencil with me. And I am not vicious, not cruel, but I'm a reader. And I will make notes in the margin of anything that doesn't work for me as a reader. Some of the time, it's things that I thought I could get away with as a writer. There's that point where you're a writer and you go, well, I don't need to write the whole battle. I can imply that it's happening. And you go, yeah, nobody's going to mind. And then you're sitting there as a reader going, but I was expecting that battle. You've led everything up to this battle, and you don't even realize. Oh, no. So you write the note saying, needs a battle. And you try and pretend that you as a writer and you as a reader are two different people. Because you're going to look at your notes. And you're going to look at the end. And that's what is going to really guide you. That is going to be the primary engine through a second draft, through an edit, through a fix. When you get to the end of your first draft of whatever it is, whether it's a short story, whether it's a novel, then you read it. You read it pretending you've never read it. You've never read it before. You read it with new eyes. And one of the questions that you ask yourself when you get to the end is, OK, what was that about? And that's the most important question that you can ask yourself. Because the difference between what you're going to do in the first draft and the second draft can often be tiny. But it's the most important draft. It's getting there. It's getting there. It's getting there. It's getting there. It's getting there. It's getting to that second draft. And the question, what is this about, is what gets you from the first draft to the second draft. Because what you're then doing is you're going, OK, in which case what I have to do now is buttress what the story is about and eliminate those places where I'm writing stuff that isn't what the story is about. And it gives you just… It's a wonderful, easy yardstick for what stays in and what goes out. It's just the idea of what is my story about. You've now written it. What you thought it was about probably isn't what it's about or it's only part of what it's about. And now it can become very, very obvious that this little bit of plot that you loved actually is just… It's just a little bit of a story. It has nothing to do with what the story is about. And that's good. And you can let it go. You can cut it out. You can save it in a file where you save things that may come in useful later. But it's OK. There is never any heartache at letting that go because you're going, this is what it's about. And by the same token, you're buttressing. You're going, here? I sort of did that thing. This is where I didn't quite know what I was doing, but I seemed to be talking about the theme. So let me go in and make that stronger. Now that I know what this is about, let me go in and just sort of shore up the sides. The process of doing your second draft is a process of making it look like you knew what you were doing all along. You always have to remember. When people tell you that… You always have to remember that something doesn't work for them. That they're right. It doesn't work for them. And that is incredibly important information. You also have to remember that when people tell you what they think is wrong and how you should fix it, that they're almost always wrong. Sometimes they're right. Sometimes they say, hey, this doesn't work, but you could do this. And you go, whoa, thank you. You just… But most of the time, when someone goes, this didn't work for me. Maybe we need this or this. You have to go, right, that doesn't work for you. That's the important information. And you think this or this would fix it. But actually, normally the problem is earlier. Normally the problem is earlier in the text. Sometimes it's something that needs to go away. Sometimes it's something that needs to be written to set something up. It is really important knowing and absolutely accepting in faith when things do not work for people. But do not ever take that as anything more than information that something doesn't work for people. Because if you try and fix things their way, you'll be writing their story. And you have to write yours. How did you come up with the idea of writing a story about a man who was killed by a woman? Long, long ago on Sandman, I wanted it to be colored by a man called Steve Wishart. Steve Wishart. By a man called Steve Whittaker. Steve's now dead. Terrific artist. Really good colorist. He colored V for Vendetta. Steve was a perfectionist. And I gave him the pages of Sandman, black and white pages. And his job was simply to color a few of them in and send them in to show the editor that he could do it. The job was his. All he had to do was send in those pages. And he never did. Steve would show me some of his pages and they were beautiful. And I would say, great, send them in. And he would say, no, no, no, not yet. They're not quite right. They're not perfect. And he was trying to make them perfect. And the people at DC Comics hired a colorist because Steve's pages never came in. . Perfect does not happen in this universe. Perfect is an ideal. Perfection is the goal. Perfection is the mountain that we are heading towards. It's the gleaming crystal city on the hill to which we aspire. But we also have to know that anything we do is going to be perfect. And that is going to contain its share of errors and mistakes. And we cannot be crippled by that. We cannot be afraid of that. If you write something, it can be improved. The problem is you cannot fix a blank piece of paper. You can fix a short story that doesn't work. You can fix dialogue that isn't quite there. You can fix the beginning of something. But you cannot fix nothingness. So you have to be brave. You have to just start. You have to be willing to let the process carry you through. And you have to be willing for it sometimes to land you on the rocks. For it not to work. And the truth is I'm sitting here as an instructor. I'm sitting here as a teacher. I'm not sure I have much more of an idea of what I'm doing now than I did when I started 30-something years ago. I know that if I'm going to write something, some things are going to be better than other things. And I won't necessarily know why. But I do know that I need to have faith in the process. I do know that if I don't write the story, there is no chance that it's going to be one of the good ones, one of the loved ones, one of the ones that win the awards, one of the ones that becomes famous, one of the ones I can read at a public reading that people will love. If I don't write it, it will never be that thing. And if I obsess and worry about the ones that I write, or I look at it and go, Oh, I thought you were going to be better. You were such a lovely idea and you're not really magic. Then that feels like I'm always going to be better. Then that feels like I'm always going to be better. Then that feels like I'm also closing the doors on the ones where I go, I had no idea you were going to be so beautiful.",

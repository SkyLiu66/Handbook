Does this sound familiar? In this video, we will look at 5 habits of interior designers who are successful on Instagram and talk about how you can apply them to your own design business, to grow your audience and get new clients. Welcome, designer! If you are new here, I'm Simona, a trained interior designer with about 15 years in social media and content marketing. On this channel, I teach interior designers and home stagers how to use social media in ways that actually generate revenue, without having to hire a social media manager or without having to become one. Now, if you ask me, Instagram is still the best platform for interior design business owners. And that includes the virtual designers, too. Instagram allows you to create not just an online portfolio of your work, but to connect with potential clients and build long-term relationships that are just necessary in this industry. However, if you want to be successful on Instagram, you can't just rely on posting random pictures and hope for the best. And that's true no matter what your idea of Instagram success looks like. It can be more followers, converting more followers into clients, or getting new networking opportunities. No matter which one it is, you need a strategy to reach your goals. And that's the first thing that successful interior designers have in common. And that's the first thing that successful interior designers have in common.

Without a strategy, your approach just isn't sustainable in the long run. And it also becomes challenging to measure the results and understand what works, which makes it difficult to replicate any success you might have later on. Following a strategy makes it so much easier to set goals and monitor your progress towards achieving them. Plus, it's easier to plan your content ahead and put your Instagram marketing on autopilot, so to speak. There are several things that a solid strategy should include. Starting with knowing who your ideal clients are. Are you looking for short-term rental owners who need guidance on how to make their properties more profitable through interior design? Or maybe you are focusing on growing families who need a well-designed home for their needs. When you have a clear picture of who you are trying to speak to, it's easier to create content that is relevant for them. For instance, a busy mom might prefer a quick reel over a lengthy carousel, while an Airbnb owner might enjoy swiping through a carousel post with easy tips for a season. The data about your ideal clients will help you establish content pillars and create a posting plan that reflects your ideal clients' active times on social media. If that sounds like a lot of work, do watch this video next, where I will walk you through the process of creating your own content plan. Consistent posting is crucial because it has a direct influence on the Instagram algorithm and how often your content gets shown to your followers. In other words, if you only post once in a while, Instagram will be able to get a lot of your followers. So, Instagram will not prioritize your content as much as it would for someone who posts consistently and frequently. Also, the more often people see your content, the more likely they are to remember your brand. Now, not everyone has time to be posting daily, and it's not what I would recommend doing either. My preferred way is to plan your content for at least a month ahead and schedule it all in advance, so that all you need to do on Instagram on a daily basis is to respond to any messages or comments or just engage with your followers.

Now, if you want to make sure that your feed looks well put together, you can use some of the schedulers that I already mentioned, like Planoly and Later, which allow you to plan your grid visually. And if you want to create branded posts or those puzzle-like posts, Canva is perfect for that. But don't make the mistake of thinking that a pretty-looking feed is all you need to get client leads. That would be way too easy. There is one more ingredient that successful designers add to their recipe for Instagram success. It's all about providing value. In other words, the reason why someone should care about your content. Sharing valuable content is a great way how to boost engagement long-term, as it's more likely that people will want to save or engage with your posts when they find them valuable. And as you may know, having a lot of people saving your posts helps to rank higher on Instagram. Now, valuable content might mean different things for different people. For some, it's providing inspiration. For others, it's content. It's not just about the content that's meant to entertain you. Or sharing information or knowledge about a certain topic. Some easy things that you can do is sharing quick design tips, how-to reels, information-packed carousels. You can even host a Q&A where you answer the frequently asked questions. Basically, this is the kind of content that is not supposed to directly sell your services, but rather add credibility and build trust in your business. That being said, there's no reason why you can't or shouldn't add a call to action to your content. You can't just add a call to action to your content. You can't just add a call to action to your content. You can't just add a call to action to your content. You can't just add a call to action to your content. Or a link to your website. It's just that you should focus on providing value first, instead of actively offering your services. There's this unwritten rule in social media marketing that for one promotional post, there should be at least four or five non-promotional posts. And this ties in with my next point, which is… Balancing promotion and keeping selling to a minimum Now, I do agree that promoting your business is important. That's why you are an Instagrammer. However, direct promotion should not be the top priority on your Instagram. In order to convert followers into clients, first you need to gain their trust. And for this, you need to be authentic and relatable, instead of acting like a salesman or saleswoman. Once again, helpful and valuable content is more likely to be engaged with and saved than direct business promotion. A checklist for a kitchen remodel, or how to transition from a kid's bedroom to a space fit for a tween, are both examples of posts that people might find valuable and be likely to save. This, coupled with a subtle call to action, will go down better than if your feed is just one ad for your business after another. It's also an example of soft selling, which is basically a more subtle way to promote your services or products, as opposed to the old school hard selling that just doesn't work that well on social media. By the way, Instagram stories can be a great tool for converting followers into clients, in a not sleazy way. And we have a whole video about that too, if you'd like to learn more. Having a successful Instagram presence is an ongoing process, and although it doesn't happen overnight, it's entirely possible to achieve. Let's recap what we learned today about the habits or things that successful interior designers do on Instagram, and that you can apply to your business as well. Number 1. Have a strategy. Know who your ideal clients are, and align your content with their needs. Number 2. Plan ahead. And keep a regular posting schedule. Use social media schedulers to make the process easier. Number 3. Have a cohesive visual theme to your feed. Choose your posts according to your brand, including the fonts and colors, and stick to one visual style. Number 4. Provide value in your content. Establish yourself as a credible source for interior design knowledge to establish trust. And number 5. Balance promotion, and keep selling to a minimum. Stick to at least 4-5% of your content. And if you're not a professional designer, you can also start with a list of 5 valuable posts for every promotional post. And prioritize soft selling, instead of promoting your design services directly.

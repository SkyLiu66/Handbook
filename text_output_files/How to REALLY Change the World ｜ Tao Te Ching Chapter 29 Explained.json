    "data": " Do you want to rule the world and control it? I don't think it can ever be done. The world is a sacred vessel and it cannot be controlled. You will only make it worse if you try. It may slip through your fingers and disappear. Some are meant to lead and others are meant to follow. Some must always strain and others have an easy time. Some are naturally big and strong and others will always be small. Some will be protected and nurtured and others will meet with destruction. The master accepts things as they are and out of compassion avoids extravagance, excesses and the extremes. We live in a world where activism is sexy. Everybody has something to say about how the world is working and how it should be working and what we need to do to get it there. And before I get too far ahead of myself, I am contractually obligated to clarify that I am not here to call out any particular political group, belief system, ideology or the people that adhere to them. I am also not saying that people are bad. I am not saying that people are bad or evil for wanting to improve the world. Of course that's not the case. However, I also don't think, and I think Lao Tzu agrees with me, that all attempts at bettering the world end up doing as much good as we hope they will. Of course it's a good desire to do good in the world. We go wrong, however, when we make the assumption that we will do this by changing other people or outside circumstances. This is the wrong way to go about trying to do good and it will always lead to negative results. See, the problem is that attempts to do good in the world by changing other things or other people operate on an unethical basis. This is an incorrect assumption. This incorrect assumption is the assumption that those other people or those other things that are out there are the problem. But this is not the case. These other things and other people are not the problem. I am the problem. You are the problem. The most important influence we have on changing the world is changing ourselves. Of course, often the things that we think need changing in the world do not need changing at all. Our human lives cover less than the tiniest sliver of the lifespan of the world, let alone the universe. We see only what presents itself to our eyes, and frankly, we manage to miss even most of that. Therefore, our perspectives are critically limited to the point that our efforts to change things around us often only create more problems. Certainly it is good to try and do good in the world, but this doesn't mean that we need to change everything that seems to us to be wrong. This is where our ability to put aside self-will and listen to our intuition comes in. Some things require our action and others do not. Some circumstances that we mistake for disasters end up having positive results. We are not the only ones who are in this situation. We are the only ones who are in this situation. We are the only ones who are in this situation. We are the only ones who are in this situation. We are the only ones who are in this situation. We should not be too quick to jump to conclusions about what is good and what is bad. We should not be too quick to jump to conclusions about what is good and what is bad. We should not be too quick to jump to conclusions about what is good and what is bad. Another problem with our desire to change things is our tendency to overlook the things that we have the greatest ability to change. For example, I may be seriously concerned about wars or unrest in other states or countries, and so I may attempt to start a society or a fundraiser or post on social media to raise awareness, but all of these things ultimately would be attempts by myself to change a situation far away from me which frankly I know very little about, compared to those who are actually there experiencing it. No matter how much I've read or learned about situations I am not directly involved in, my understanding of them will never be as great as if I were actually experiencing them, and therefore my ability to propose solutions to these problems is greatly diminished. We often would do much better to focus on the good we can do within our own spheres of influence. Our well-intentioned efforts for world change so often shipwreck on the fatal flaw that almost all humans share, the horror and neglect of the obvious. Because of this flaw, we often overlook the most basic and obvious duties in favor of advanced, far-reaching, and supposedly spiritual or humanitarian ones. Should I be so eager to get involved in a conflict halfway across the world if at the same time I'm utterly failing to address conflict in my own home? All the care and concern in the world for mystery people that we have never met becomes pretty hollow if at the same time we gossip about our neighbors, feud with our parents, or neglect the emotional needs of our family members. We tend to think of changing the world as an outside-in job, but it's not. It's an inside-out job. The most important duty we have if we want to improve our lives is to be able to do what we want to do. To improve the world is to improve ourselves. As we do this, our goodness will spread to our inner circles, to our families, to our communities, our countries, and from there to the entire world. But importantly, this is not a campaign of any organized group of people or politicians. This is a movement of billions of individuals, each taking responsibility for themselves and their own personal virtue. This is the only way to create real, lasting change. One author put it this way, The answer to the question, what is wrong, is or should be, I am wrong. Until a man can give that answer, his idealism is only a hobby. If we put first things first and focus on making sure we are the best people we can be, we will find that we gain the power to change the world in meaningful ways, and that most importantly we will do it naturally. If we are living in harmony with Tao and are responsive to intuition, it will become apparent to us where we are most needed. We will not neglect those closest to us in favor of those we have never met. Our ability to create lasting change will increase because we will not be trying to do so. It will be a natural result of the people we have become. Thanks for watching and I will see you all tomorrow for chapter 30. Peace and blessings.",

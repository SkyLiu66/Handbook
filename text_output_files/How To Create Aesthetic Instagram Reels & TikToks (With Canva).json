So when Canva reached out to me to see if I wanted to make a video on how I can highlight their video editing platform, I was pretty excited because I definitely feel like this might be helpful for those of you watching who don't have as much experience in a professional video editing software. And just to make this tutorial a little bit more user-friendly and accessible, I'm not going to use my professional video cameras like I normally do on this channel. I'm just going to use my iPhone and Canva to create an aesthetic Instagram reel. So first you need an idea or topic. So you don't necessarily have to come up with an original idea every single time. Just scroll through these apps, spend a couple minutes scrolling and seeing if there's anything that strikes your interest and something you want to try putting your own spin on. Now for this tutorial, I decided to create sort of like a mini vlog or motivational video that just shows snippets of my routine. I personally really enjoy watching these types of vertical videos whenever I'm scrolling through my feed. I'm going to be using my iPhone and Canva to create an aesthetic Instagram reel. So first you need an idea or topic. So you don't necessarily have to come up with an original video. Just scroll through these apps and see if there's anything that strikes your interest and feed. It's just cool to peer into someone else's life, see what their routine is like. Now lately, I've been trying this new thing where I sleep pretty early and then wake up pretty early at 5 a.m. So I really wanted to share a little bit of snippet of what my 5 to 9 a.m. routine looks like and use that as the topic for this reel. Now when it comes to shooting, I want to share some tips with you that I keep in mind when using my smartphone or iPhone to capture clips. First things first is I lock exposure or I set my exposure before I actually step into frame or capture my clip. It's a dead giveaway, but I'm going to be using this to capture my clips. So I'm going to be using this to capture my clips. So I'm going to be using this to capture my clips. I'm going to be using this to capture my clips. So I'm going to be using this to capture my clips. that a video isn't professional or aesthetic if the exposure is constantly changing or autofocus is hunting. So you'll notice for a lot of these shots, I typically will underexpose it just because I kind of like that moodier aesthetic, but find the exposure that works for the vibe they're going for. Next, you want to make sure you set your phone to shoot in 4k and 30 frames per second. So for Instagram natively in the app, it likes to have 1080 by 1920 as far as the video size. So that's a vertical video. And then also likes to have 30 FPS clips or 30 frames per second. So I will try to shoot my videos in those settings natively in my camera so that I have the best chance at a high quality video in the app itself. Honestly, I feel like people don't use the time-lapse function as often as just like a regular clip or even cinematic mode. But personally, I feel like being able to capture a quick time-lapse with your phone can really add a dynamic element to your videos. Now, the last shooting tip is more gear oriented, but of course, if you're shooting yourself, you're going to need some sort of tripod or some way to hold your phone up so you can record clips. I've been using this mobile tripod that I bought off Amazon that I found out from my friend Zach Kravitz from watching his content. And honestly, shout out to Zach because it's a really cool mobile tripod. But essentially, this tripod is pretty great because it could extend to a pretty tall height. It's pretty travel friendly. It gets pretty compact. This video is not sponsored by Tumtech or the brand of the mobile tripod. Just a big fan of it. And yeah, I think it works really well. So I typically scroll through my Instagram reels feed to find a trending audio, which means that it's going to be a little bit more dynamic. So I'm going to go ahead and there's a song you'll see in the bottom left corner. There's a song name and there's typically like a little arrow that's pointing up if it's a trending song. Now, that's not the only thing that I look at. So when I look and click on the song, I usually try to find songs that are under 10,000 plays. So you'll click on a trending song, but sometimes there'll be, you know, 100,000 plays or even 50,000 plays. Those are songs that are trending. But also a lot of people have already made videos using that song. So I will typically try to find a trending song that's under 10,000 plays and then create my reel using that song. A quick little hack that makes editing a little bit easier for me too, is that once I find the trending song, I will typically screen record on my phone the song itself so that I can airdrop that screen recording to my computer so that I could take the audio of the trending song. Basically, it just helps me edit a little bit quicker because I don't have to try to edit it and hope it matches in the phone once I import it into the app. All right, so I'm on the cam. I'm on the homepage now. We're going to be designing an Instagram reel. So let's go to videos, Instagram reel to get the proper format. And now we have a vertical video format for the edit. It's super easy to trim the clips down. You just click the clip and then there's a little scissor icon here. You press it and then you can just trim the video to whatever needs and then hit done and then it'll reflect in the timeline. I also dragged in the audio file, which is the screen recording that I mentioned earlier. And I've converted that screen recording to an MP4 file that's natively into an MP3 file. I'll link down below a place where you can kind of go from MP4 to MP3. So that way I have just a basically an audio only file, which is the only way Campbell will interpret it. So now if you look under the videos tab, I have clips and then under the audio tabs, I have basically my screen recording that I got earlier. And now we can start cutting the video to this song. More so video editing tip is make sure you change the video clips pretty quickly and you don't lose the attention of the viewer. So honestly, like I don't stay on, you know, once the beat drops or depending on the vibe I'm going for, I don't stay on one clip for longer than maybe one second, one and a half seconds. So they have tons of adjustments that you can actually make within the editor here. So like warmth, tint, brightness, contrast, highlight, shadows, really nice that it offers all these types of features. So we're going to go ahead and just adjust this. I kind of like the cooler tone, bring the brightness up just a tad, shadows just a little bit. I really like the cooler tone. So we're going to keep it there. Now, one of the big reasons why I feel like Canva might make sense for some of you who are kind of getting into video editing would just be because you use Canva for other design needs. Maybe you've made flyers, maybe you've made PowerPoints, but Canva was obviously known first for the design things, and they still are, and they're dabbling into video now, but it's really nice because a lot of their UI on the design side of things have carried over into the video editor. And so we're going to go ahead and grab a font here and make it bold. What's nice is we could just adjust everything from letter spacing, line spacing, the font size. We can just make it really small because I like small fonts. So let's say we add a text here and we want to animate it. It's as simple as clicking the text, hitting animate. Ooh, I like this spread one. So let's use this spread element. Another awesome feature that Canva is rolling. Now is that if you right click this element and do show timing, you can actually adjust when it shows up in the clip, which is really nice that you can make the micro adjustment like that for when your title pops up instead of it just hovering over the entire duration of said clip. So let's say I want to actually have it just come up starting from this point on like one second in or let's say 0.5 seconds in, and I want it to go before the clip ends. We can do that. So basically we adjust the timing. We hit take, play it back, and then it comes in, leave it for the clip ends. As a beginner video editor who may not have access to a bunch of different resources or tools because that's something you really accumulate over years. The fact that you can just access the elements tab on Canva and they have songs, they have videos, they have shapes, they have graphics, they have titles. It's pretty great for someone who's first starting out. Now, obviously, the background remover photos, but there are a lot of times where you might need to remove the background of a video clip. Now, for the purpose of this example, let's say I don't want all the stuff behind my wrist. So we're going to go ahead and use the background remover. Before we do that, I've added in an image here as I grab from the elements tab, grab the photo, drag it beneath the clip right here. So let's go ahead and size this up and then use the background remover. Boom. And as you can see, now we have the image below my wrist with the background removed. And now this is cool because then we can go ahead and maybe drag in some titles here. You can even animate the title, right? And now what we have here is a little background remove clip with the motion graphic title that we can use for social and whatnot. Now of course we would change the text if I was actually using this, not going to use the background remover for my actual reel. So let's go ahead and remove that. So let's go ahead and click the plus sign in between these two clips and you can add a transition. Let's say, let's use the. Dissolve one. What's cool is you can actually set the duration of how long that dissolve transition is. And you can see now that there's a little icon in between these two clips indicating that there's a transition happening, and then you can add as many transitions as you want in between your video clips. So I'm going to fine tune a few more things within the editor and color the rest of my clips. And here is what the finished result looks like. It's pretty simple, but considering I use my phone and an online video editor, I feel like it's pretty sweet. So at the end of the day, if you're watching this and you're wondering if it's actually worth it to invest some time into learning the Canva video editor. I think if you already use the Canva video editor, you're going to be able to use it as a tool. And if you already use Canva and their design tools, and you have familiarity with a lot of their function and UI, I think you will find the video editor to be really seamless, especially if you're trying to just start getting your feet wet with video editing. Video editing is going to be something you're going to have to learn, especially with how much video is coming up on the rise, short form video, long form video, video is just here to stay. So. If you want to get your feet wet with any video editor or any video editing software, you will thank yourself a couple of years down the line when everyone's doing video.

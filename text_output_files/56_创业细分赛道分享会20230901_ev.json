    "data": " Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Today I'm going to share with you how to create a new track for the X-Pen. Why do we have this kind of sharing? First, we found that the X-Pen track was a great opportunity for ordinary people in 2023. Let's look at a case. A broccoli. Let's look at its main page. First, I want to say it's an ordinary person. Why? Because he earned 300,000 yuan in two years through online novels. To be honest, he earned 300,000 yuan in two years in this field. He is not a head of the team. At most, he is a central department. Even if it's such an account, he spent about 8 months in the beginning of this year. He sold classes through live broadcasts. He sold classes in the small red book live broadcast. He transferred 1.21 million yuan. And it was only a live broadcast. So we can see that the X-Pen track is really a big gap for ordinary people. And we also found that so many accounts and IPs have been surveyed. They are really rich in small red books. So we have to do it. And then the second one is that I also brought a dozen students who are doing the X-Pen track. We also surveyed a lot of accounts of this same industry. We will find that they have a lot of common problems. They have a lot of common problems. And these common problems can be moved to the process of our account. So today's sharing is really dry. So everyone is ready to drink water. I believe if you can really understand and understand it, and implement it in the process of your account, it will definitely help you to avoid a lot of detours in this process. Okay, before we start the formal sharing, I want to ask you first. Have you encountered these problems? You can take a look. If you have, you can put the corresponding code in the comments area in our interactive area. Everyone must interact. Your interaction on the one hand gives me feedback. It can make my next sharing more targeted and more focused on your questions. Secondly, everyone is in the process of interaction. It is also a process of participation. Your understanding, including your understanding, can be more profound. Okay, let's take a look at these problems. Have you encountered them? First of all, the first one. I did this thing. There are also many peers doing it. How can I compete with them? Where is my difference? And the second one is, oh, I often have to keep this track, right? It's illegal to do it. It's very annoying. What to do? And the third one. I posted it for a while. I found my notes. Oh, there's a period of time. There are so many of them. It's all your numbers. I feel like the data can't go up. It seems like I can't hold on. What to do? And the fourth one. I feel like my mother is always saying that others also make money through the live broadcast of Little Red Book. I actually want to know. I want to know. I want to do it. But I've always felt like I wasn't ready. No equipment. No drawing. Something like that. I always feel like I need to prepare a lot, right? And then the fifth one. There is information. There are some people who come to you for advice. But it's hard to deal with. Why? Why do you encounter these problems? I see that the little friends have already been in this comment area. There are 135, 145. Basically, first of all, I want to say that these problems are the ones we have investigated. So many peers. Including me. I ran dozens of these customers and students. Almost everyone has encountered these problems. Including ourselves. When I was still filming my mother's account, I would encounter these problems. How do good people solve these problems? I think it's considered from two levels. The first is the new law. The second is the law of law. First of all, the new law is actually very simple. Since everyone has encountered these problems, how do others solve them? Others just can't. No one came up and went all the way. Just move down. Just come up directly. It's all about dealing. You will definitely encounter it in the process. Right? The solution is very simple. Persistence plus continuous review. If you encounter a problem, you can analyze where the problem is. Then solve it. And the second is that some people sent two or three notes. Four or five notes. Ask why the data is not good. Or why there is no deal. Others only have a deal after sending 20 notes. You sent four or five. The amount didn't go up. How could there be a change? So it is. So it's from the bright side to the The solution is actually very simple. It's persistence. Then add the copy and the continuous waiting. You can see the result. This is the new law level. The other one is the next one I'm going to talk about. The law of law. It's divided into four aspects. I'm going to talk about the first one. Is the positioning. The second is the personality. The third is your content and topic selection. The fourth is to consider it from the transformation level. So many customers. We finally found that. Summarize a core point. It's about positioning. The more detailed, the more money you make. The more detailed, the more money you make. So how do you understand this point? Two aspects to understand. Two core points. The first one is. The needs of the user you solve. It must be enough. Just give an example. For example, we just saw that writing a web novel. This one. He went to teach others to write web novels to make money. Then you say. Why don't I teach others to write love letters? Writing love letters. This thing. Compared to making money through writing web novels. It's more obvious. It hurts more, doesn't it? More For example, it's also an improvement in teaching PPT skills. One way is. I teach you how to do it through PPT. To do a paid job. To make money. This is the first one. And the second one. This is. I teach you how to write a report in the workplace. PPT. Which one do you think is more painful? Which one is more difficult? If it's the front. If you're a first. If you think it's a workplace skill. Play two. Come on, everyone. Let's interact. All right. Let me take a look. Give me a little friend to interact with. Come on, let's play. Hey, everyone. Ha, one. Tianyu Zhang Tianyu. It's one. Right? Hey, everyone. It's obvious. Which one hurts more? Right? And then the second one. That's what we're going to do. This track. Or we're going to solve this problem. It's been verified online. Why is it already verified? Don't go to the cannon. No verification. We're going to verify it again. In general, it's a cannon. Right? Someone else has been verified. We've been very general. As long as my method is right. That's OK. No problem. Good. So how do we do it? What's good about the points? A key point is. You you you you call in. Or the one who serves you. You must have a clear border. Actually, you don't want anyone. One person. Someone comes and asks. I'll take it. It's not that we only aim for a small group of people. Then we'll take this one again. 写作赛道的一颗新兰花来举例哈我们打开看一下她的这个网页她聚焦的是哪些点首先第一个哈新手写小说 对吧新手写小说然后啊塑造女主角对吧 好那我们再来看一下哈我给大家分享一下我们在调研的过程当就是去到她的思域去调研得到的结果是 首先她聚焦的人群是年轻的上班族加宝妈而且是小白选手而且她只招收女性学员 她只招女性学员哈因为她说爱自己是女性更懂女性阅读喜好更懂女性的思维模型 然后第二个呢就是她的目标不是说教你去写什么公众号啊不是教你去写简历啊什么职场报告啊我就教你 怎么样通过写网文小说去变现好她只聚焦这几个点 好 那为什么为什么要去做这么细分或者为什么要聚焦的这么就是编辑这么清晰 我来举个例子哈比如说同样是叫写作同样叫写作我们在得道上哈这是一个知识付费公司哈在得道上 去搜一下写作会发现光写作的课程有四个 而且呢他们的课程的作者都是什么都是一些什么大神什么创始人啊 啊什么科学家啊什么专家之类的你说我们一个普通人跟这些人 竞争 竞争的过来吗根本竞争不过来对吧哎所以我们第一个原因就是要去避免和大神竞争啊然后第二个呢就是越细分越专业为什么还举个例子比如同样还是写那个写作别人教你啊你可以说我有个课可以教你写文章啊比如说公众号的文章啊朋友圈的文啊职场写作啊对吧这个课程这第一个然后第二个呢就是我只教女生写网文小说的课你们觉得哪一个人更专业 啊 大家也可以在评论区互动起来哈前者是一后者是二大家可以打一下好吗让我看到大家去怎么去理解这件事情的就如果有一个人今天说哎我教你怎么写文章吧这是第一个然后第二个是我只教女生而且是小白写网络小说去赚钱大家觉得哪一个更专业一些 哎只教女生更只教女生写作更专业对吧哎呀摄影师的真棒 哎对写网络小说因为他切的足够细啊我就感觉哎你好像更专业对吧这个就很好理解了好那接下来这个是我们讲的在写作这个赛道啊这个举的几个例子那我们再看一下其他的赛道吧比如说跨境电商我有一位同学在鹏城我们来点开他的这个主页大家去看一下哈他聚焦在哪个点首先大家看一下 亚马逊亚马逊亚马逊亚马逊 他做跨境电商就是他自己还做跨境电商做的比较好然后他转过来赋能同行哎如果你想做跨境电商我可以教你 所以会发现他没有聚焦说我就教你跨境电商跨境电商有太多平台了对吧他只聚焦在亚马逊这一个平台上包括我们也调研了他还 聚焦在哪些人群哈是有过创业经历的且有一定的就是商业认知而且有一定 这种资金积累的人他不会教起纯小白的小白进来以后他不会接的对吧这是人群上聚焦然后第二个呢就是啊交的目标他只教怎么在亚马逊开店 不会去教什么在你在tiktok上面啊或者其他的跨境电商平台去去做对吧所以这个也是一个细分和聚焦的一个体现 好的第二然后另外一个呢就是pbt创业赛道为大家也看一个案例哈小葵交pbt 大家看到他这个主页啊就是第一眼看过去是什么感受月入多少收入多少收入多少收入多少 很明显他是教大家怎么样通过pbt去赚钱接副业赚钱对不对 好那一样的他教小白怎么做pbt副业赚钱但不会去切职场片pbt的技能提升我不会教你啊怎么样把一场汇报的pbt 做好 这就是关于啊我们讲 这个呢我们我们举的是创业细分的这个赛道的例子其实其他赛道也是一样的哈比如说啊支付费交英语也是一样的道理我们就是如果说哎我只教你英语不聚焦人群很难去说我和那些就是真的很厉害大神去竞争对吧然后这个呢是我们刚讲到的第一个点就是关于定位月细分月赚钱这个点大家看一下这个点我也没有讲清楚有没有什么疑问啊 哈可以在评论区打出来好吧 啊然后没有问题的话我们就进入到第二个核心的点就是关于人设 那啊看了那么多的账号之后呢我们也是和总结出一个核心还要立指导者人设就老师人设 而不是非单纯的分享者那这两个有什么区别为大家举个例子还分享的是什么就是在上面分享我是 获得了什么样的成就我有多厉害 训练记举个例子要知道哈比如说这个呃悠悠情韵教钢琴的啊弹钢琴的一个账号 来大家看一下哈 他的粉丝量六十三点七万不少了吧哪怕是在抖音已经是一个不小的量级了哟好再来看一下他的账号里面都是些什么内容比如说我们看一下这个点赞特别高的笔记哈 啊 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 我们就不看我们就不看完了哈 啊 嗯 然后我们在浏览一下他的所有的笔记几乎所有的笔记都在炫或者说都在展示我有端多专业我有多厉害我有多会弹钢琴但是大家能能感受到这个感受的感受是什么呢 嗯 What kind of transformation does this account go through? Or do you think if you want to learn piano, will you go find him? Will you go find him? Let's take a walk in the comment area, okay? Oh, no, why not Because of two aspects The first one He can play the piano Not necessarily he can teach piano right Then the second one through his account The main page or the notes You can't see it Does he have any service? Does he have any service? right Yes, the meeting room and the meeting room are completely different Two things, right So we can see clearly This is the sharing personality So give everyone an inspiration It's in your notes You don't just talk about how professional you are How good you are How good you are, right You have to reflect your leadership personality What is the leadership personality? I want to show that I am very good at my profession At the same time I can guide you I can teach you to make money Or I can take you how about For example, I I made money through ppt At the same time I can teach you And then at the same time What I have done with someone What did you do to prove it? In fact, this is what we used to tell you In our notes To melt the personality Give a hook to the case Let everyone know you are a teacher What service can you give me Right, I'll give you an example For example, these two typical Uh, this topic What did I do through what uh Monthly number of weeks It also helped some students Through what? Right Earned money Let's take a look at the disassembly of this script Very typical Point out the problem in front And then? Today I will tell you in detail How to use the English-based reading RZ A sentence first Uh, point out the whole topic, right And then he didn't come up and tell you at the beginning What's the first step What's the second step What's the third step But he wants to say first This one can be said to be a practice As an English teacher Lead at least 100 students 100 students Successfully realized the capital reading from zero What do you feel from this sentence Very obscure Not to mention very obscure It's very uh It's obvious Just tell everyone Ah, I'm a teacher And I have a successful case Ah, what service do I have? Right This is actually to Uh, integrate yourself as a guide Secondly, where can we show it Except for us in our notebook case Where else can it be displayed It's in the mud city Ah, for example, why do we have to do it? Why do we have to add it in the mud city For example, I am an English teacher Add a tourist Right Add a what The ip of the mother-in-law Then the introduction It can also be reflected in your introduction Right For example, why do we say You are in your introduction Tell everyone directly What service do you provide For example, I provide ip running service You go and see the mother-in-law Is there any introduction in that introduction Right And then in the notebook case We just said it, right And then the third one is in the comment area This may be us Just before There is no Too many people to consider a point Let me give an example For example, let's take a look at this note He is here Just share how much you do every day How good is it Right No void Then in the comment area Brought a top-notch I have two things to prepare recently The first is the four or six-level list Test salt list Right And you make a note in the comment area Tell everyone what you can do Click on the comment area and you will see it right away This is also a way And then there is another way Is that you are special Give your personal note one side To introduce Give an example This kind of direct sharing of student cases And the notes of customer cases you see It's also a broccoli In his main page He just sent a note My own student Got the achievement of such a note Although the point is not good But the main page of the point can be seen very clearly You have a student Right Love you in teaching others these things It will be very clear Ok This is what I share with you The second point is about how to establish a personality What kind of personality This point Everyone take a look at me Have you made it clear Can interact in the comment area Or about this point Do you have any other confusion and questions Can be called out in the comment area Ok Ok If this point is ok No problem We will enter the third point below It's our core point Go on the content On the content We just choose this topic Right At this point I want to emphasize a point with you What is it To target the pain point of the user Yang point to cut in and out of the front page of the content Why emphasize this Because we will find that we have a lot of That little friend They all think I think this thing is good I think this is professional I think this thing I'm talking about this thing I have a lot of speech How about There is a sentence on the Internet I don't want you to think I want me to think I can't stand on my own To be self-conscious We want to see What do our target users care about Right This point is very important How do we judge a good content I think good content We must be Let users have expectations He is willing to go in Must be expecting something Right How to reflect I think it can be drawn into a few Contrast Curiosity and sense of series and money In fact, this is because it is a business segment So everyone cares most about Is that I can make money with you That's actually the point that users care about Change to another channel For example, the knowledge and pay channel For example, I teach English How to test the ASE What do you care about most In fact, the most concerned is to score I can't test with you Can I improve my score Right Then different channels You have to go to the list Or go to find the most concerned user What is the most painful point Okay, let's take a few examples For example, contrast Let's take a look Don't do Amazon with your new hands I beg you Let's take a look at this note Probably browse Is it white Or you don't want to lose money You have to listen carefully This is definitely a must-see guide If I tell you that Amazon can earn one million a month Do you believe it I believe you should hear this often But I want to tell you a truth This kind of thing doesn't happen to you One million a month Okay, let's take a look If you are interested in the back Can share this article with everyone You can take your time to look at it In fact, we can see it from the title Hey, everyone will say How is this going We have to do it, right? Usually encourage everyone to do it quickly Follow me to do it But people are like a I'm going to make money, but I advise you not to do it You will think it's amazing Everyone is different, right? A sense of contrast Okay, the second one is curiosity Causes everyone's curiosity For example, give an example The point is how much do I earn Give what kind of ambassador to the same industry Or give someone a big truth Yujia teacher who earns 20,000 I want to learn from Yujia to say the truth What kind of big truth is it I feel like you're going to say something It's something that others don't know Right, it triggered my curiosity I want to see what you're talking about Big truth, right? Okay, how does the series feel? Now our main business In fact, through the main business It's mainly to show It's the same harmonious and unified cover design Including the same style of content output We often tell everyone about this Our main business must be as unified as possible Right, it looks professional I'll give you a few more examples later And then the second one is the point that users care about In the entrepreneurial segment track is related to money We have seen so much Some bloggers who are better at this track Or IP Their topics are really 60% Even more than money How to show it In the title and title To show I'll give you an example You see this little Kui taught PPT, right? You can click on it and it's all money All money All money Okay, so how can it be reflected in money? In the entrepreneurial segment track Typical topics What is the profit? Big public? What did I do? What did I do? What is my profit? And then the second is the big story of making money What did I do? How much money did I make? How did I do it? And then there's another one It's not afraid of hard work With me, I made four to five thousand Let's click and have a look at this note I'm not a small shop like this Our industry doesn't just say you just have to make it delicious Most consumer groups are still young now Young people are lazy So we have to promote Will be a sale Have to update fast Can't be alone Have more patterns It's delicious and it's good I have to be happy Now self-reliance is a must at the moment So you have to catch this wind Choose the right track Don't want to work Okay, let's take a look Let's take a look at the comments section This data is particularly good All are ball bags Want to learn ball bags Right? The core is that people really tell you And you do it with me through these things You can make money You can see the result Okay, I just talked about this, right? The main page of the small KVT It's really related to money Ah, here I want to explain one more Some friends may think Oh, I'm just in the apartment every day To sun my own money It feels pretty low And it feels a little bit like that I'm just a little bit suspicious Everyone must overcome this psychological threshold I think I can understand Everyone has some psychological concerns like this But you really can't Because you think about it Why do others work with you Is it because you are happy with your work? Right? You are the one who teaches others to make money The most willing is that I work with you Do you have money to earn? Right? So you have to put this point as much as possible to reflect And then the second one about the content What is the point? Just a lot of friends may sit and sit Just find out that I am recently very happy with my work I don't know what to post recently What am I doing? Right? And then I don't know what content to look for So I want to emphasize this point to everyone One point is that we don't want to find new content for each topic Because the money is repeated When we do that You will find that those bloggers In their main page There are three to five topics in the core topic Then find your core topic Find your data is good Good data Then copy it crazily Of course, this crazy copy is a little bit too fast Or a little bit exaggerated You find a good data Then you modify the title of the cover The content inside You may change a little bit of the expression Or a little bit of the editing Re-post it So your production cost will not be so high At the same time It's really verified It's a copy That's it He will still be in the report Okay, this point Then we are still using this one The broccoli as an example Let's take a look at his main page In fact, it's just a few topics Right Hey, the draft cost is 300,000 White quickly entered The tools to write novels What website App, AI tools, etc. In fact, it's just a few That's it, right Okay, then this is what we talked about The second one about content What is the third point You must find a way to let your product Introduction and your personality content Put in a narrow position Users can see it at a glance Don't expect to say I'm already in my notebook Or I have already reflected I'm a professional You don't expect your users to guess What service you may have Or what products you have Introduce directly Introduce your products and services directly Tell everyone what you have What service is provided This is to be customized In our main page Then the second point Is about the story of the personality type Because we tell everyone I have this Tell everyone I have this service I can solve your problem Then everyone will say Why do I believe you Why do I believe you Why can you help me solve this problem That is, you have to introduce yourself Personality Introduce yourself Why can you do these things Right The first one is to tell everyone Who are you What are you doing How sincere and reliable you are Responsible Worth your trust Right Typical cases For example, how much money I made How did I do it In fact, it is also a case of one I open it You can take a look You see Here is my income And then tell everyone How did I do it Let's take a look at his comment area Right All are more accurate users Okay Then the next little friends There may be another problem I know Life is very important I want to tell you I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know how but feel but how to write How to write a personal story Right Well, here I will practice We watched so many people In Tiktok In своих To tell your own story That core In fact Everyone is different But to sum it up Have a formula Have a formula It's pus-p earthly Plus your awesome present W prophet experience Then after the turning Then you get the success In the end, you also Apps Stronger strength I specifically explain why you have to talk about your bitter past. The first aspect is that you have to ask for help. I used to be like you. I also have one or two or three problems. I also find that I don't know what to write. I'm also worried that I don't make enough money by writing it myself. Right? This is one aspect. You have to ask for help. You have to let him know that you are the one who has encountered one or two or three problems. I have also encountered it. The second one is the sense of reality. If you come up and just introduce yourself, how good am I? I've been running all the way. I'm really good. There's no perfect person. It will make everyone feel unreal, right? Of course, you say that the personality is very important. You have to be bitter and awesome or something. But our personality must be real. You don't have to force it. I used to be miserable. Now I'm so good. This personality must be real. Because you can only be sustainable because you are real. Right? You have to continue to expand your advantages and highlights. I'll give you another example. For example, let's take a look at this article. My test result is good. I'm good. I'll give you another example. I'm good. As a girl who was born in an extremely male-dominated women's area, is this talking about my bitter past? And then some details. I remember once during the New Year, this is the details. Story, right? By these details, how bitter and difficult it was to express myself. It doesn't deserve to be squandered. Later, I got into high school and got into 985. Then I got into the salt exam again. I got into 985, right? And then finally, I broke up with my family. Finally, I got into a school of law. Later, I was able to live up to this series of my own stories. What did I live up to? I just did anything I wanted to do for myself, not to be bound by the world. Actually, this is very simple, but it's a good way to use such a formula. And you think, wow, this is a joke. After you hear it, you will feel very real, right? Very touching. Okay, there's another one. For example, this is a rural person who was born without an eye. He is a student of the second year of the exam, and he is a student of the second year of the exam. This is also a similar sentence. If you are interested, you can click on it later. Okay, then after we have finished talking about this positioning, personality, and content, the next step is to us. How to transform when you make money? First of all, our first point is that we will find that in the industry, the West Branch of the track is the most efficient trading venue in the current small red book live broadcast room. There is no doubt. There is no doubt. Why? Why is it so? I still take this as an example. A blue flower is a network text teaching. It started in December last year. It's August 24th, which is about eight months. He made 121.1 million yuan in the live broadcast room alone. More importantly, he is as ordinary as we are. Even if we look at some of his stories, we will find that his resources and his abilities are even better than some of the friends of everyone now. But people can get such a big result. So it shows that the small red book live broadcast room is really worth our research or admission. Okay, so how do we do the small red book live broadcast room? First of all, the first core observation point is that everyone may be worried that I have only a few people in the live broadcast room. There are not many people, right? It seems that there are very few people. What is the point I want to tell you? Your transaction is not equal to the audience. How many people do you have? Your audience has a point of view, but it is not so big. So the core point is that the number of people you have is not so big. What is the core point? What is the accuracy of the user when you enter your live broadcast room? Right? Let's take an example. For example, take a look at a broccoli. When he started, in June, right? It's been half a year since he live broadcast. In June, his live broadcast room only had 100 people. 200 people. 200 people. This is not to say that he is online at the same time. In total, he has been live broadcasting for two hours. More than 100 people have watched it in total. In fact, this is just like you. For example, in Douyin, he is really bad at random. Then he was a little better in July. Three or five hundred people. In August, it was less than 1,000 people. Right? Seven or eight hundred people. So you will find that he can deal with so many people. So it can be seen that it is not really that you have to have so many people. Right? And then the second is that we will find that people who enter the live broadcast room through notes enter 10 times more accurately than others. This is what we are in the live broadcast room of Pai Ma. It's a very, very obvious feeling. It's like, for example, through the discovery page, through this other channel, these users, their payment conversion rate and the payment conversion rate compared to this note, the note is 10 times higher than other channels. So what is the core point? We really want to do live broadcasting. At the same time, we also want to ensure that our notes update frequency. Okay, this live broadcast. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Okay, this live broadcast. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Okay, let's go. So what are we talking about in the live broadcast room? First of all, we may think that I'm talking about my professional knowledge in the live broadcast room. Or what's wrong with what I'm talking about? I feel like I didn't make any mistakes. So what I want to tell you here is that we need to tell our own stories more. Emphasize that I am the same as you. When I used to write, when I used to do PPT, when I used to open a store, I also encountered one, two, three problems like you. The core is to share with users. So the user-to-user relationship is more important than the individual goods. How awesome is it to talk about yourself? How great is it? How much money did I make a month when I wrote the web text? How much money did I make a month when I opened a store? There's another point to talk about these things. It's not hard to talk about these things. It's not hard. For example, at the beginning, I only got two or three likes for updating my notes. Something like that, right? But then I found out what was the problem. It can be solved in a blink of an eye. So I can do it for ordinary people. The second is to talk about these things. What can you help your customers with? Just talk about your course, your product, your service. What can help you solve the problem? The core is these points. Of course, the more detailed content, you can go to see the course of the open mother. Okay, what's the third one? Everyone is waiting. I have to prepare the equipment. I have to prepare the drawing. I have to prepare the PPT, right? So we're going to give you a case for this point. I'm still a blue flower. Take a look at him. He shared it himself, including how he did it when he was on the live broadcast in December. He has no chemical system in the live broadcast room. Just type there. Write a novel. People will be curious after coming in. Ask him what he is doing. Then he will answer. And at the same time, he himself, because he is working, he is on duty to do this. So he only has two hours of rest. He will go to the car and live for an hour. Even sometimes he used to say that he had no time to live when he was on a business trip. What to do? Live on the live broadcast. Right? So you will find that how come people have these problems? How can it still be broadcast? Really, you don't have to be confused. I said I would buy my equipment first. I'll start when I'm ready with everything. When you're ready, Xiao Hong said live broadcast. Others have already done it. You don't have a chance to get into the game. Right? Okay, this is the third point. And the fourth point is I want to share with you a point. Who is the first to hit? Who has the initiative? Then I want to share with you here. What is a point? Just Why would others choose your service? Why would others choose to buy your product? The core point or the first point is The first point is definitely not that I trust you. I believe you are a person. The first point is that you have to let him know first. You have this service, right? See you first. This is the user's decision. Deciding to choose your premise is not to trust you. It's not to recognize you, but to see you first. So how do you do this? That is, you have to keep exposing yourself in the apartment. Make more comparisons. Dig live. One day you will see this point. I have a deep understanding. That is, everyone can go back and ask if you are this one you are dealing with. For example, I do this training for ppt. Teach everyone how to make money with ppt. You ask those of you. Why would your students choose you instead of choosing small kpt? Many people say that small kpt is also teaching. I don't even know. He didn't even know this person. How did he choose with you? So the core point is really to expose yourself first. Let others know about it. Right? It's very simple. Look at a broccoli. Why can he do such good data? He has more than 20 live broadcasts every month. Every day is two hours. And he has to update a note every two days. We have a little friend. Ten days and a half have passed. Updated three notes. You still expect to say why my data is not good. Why is no one looking for me? Isn't this obvious? Right? Okay, what's the last point? It's that we really serve our customers well. Let them really get the result. At this time, the user really shows their gratitude. And they are willing to speak up for you on the small red book. For example, a broccoli. It really helps its students to get the result. And the students are willing to help him stand on the platform in the small red book. This is actually very good. When we ask your students, they are willing to stand on the platform for me. It's a very good core point. I think. Okay, that's all I want to share with you. A few insights about variables. I think it's also very helpful for everyone. Okay, let's look back. Our sharing today is over. Let's look back at the questions we mentioned at the beginning. One, two, three, four, five questions. Did you answer them? In fact, you will find that no question can be solved in one or two sentences. It is a multi-faceted factor. First of all, I think that in addition to these things at the level of the method, it is also more important to consider the level of the mind. It's really all the problems that have been encountered. Why can some people make a result? Some people can really succeed. The core is that people insist on doing it. If you encounter a problem, it's not that this problem is why I encountered it. Am I not suitable to do it? How is this thing so difficult? Some people end their own way. Some people will say that they encountered this problem. How to solve it? I'll ask. I'll check it out. I'll find it. I'll stack it up. Right? So, what I want to share with you today is actually these two points. Okay, that's all for my sharing. Take a look at it. Is there any other questions about the content I shared today? Or you can call me in the comments if you encounter any other problems in the process of doing this. Or you can connect to the microphone. Open the microphone directly. Let me add something. Thank you for the sharing, Ms. Huo. I'll add something first. Because I guess that maybe in the process, when people listen to it, there will be some questions and questions. Although the chat area of the meeting today is so quiet. I'll ask everyone first. Do you have a little friend later? Do you need a microphone? If you have one, I have a voice. Okay, you can wait a moment. Okay, so I'll finish this part. Let's connect. Then, if you have a friend who needs a microphone, just type a microphone in the chat room. Two words. Okay, I'll say it first. For this part of the sharing today, I'll tell you a few points first. It's possible that you will feel it. I'm not sure. The first one is that I know that the little red book live broadcast is a blockbuster. Do I want to live broadcast now? Is this a confusion and doubt of many of you? Let me tell you. The little red book live broadcast is like this. The first one is that the little red book live broadcast is not a tool for traffic. Do you know that? If you don't want to say that I did a live broadcast, I put my whole palm on it. I put my whole palm on it. I put my whole palm on it. I put my whole palm on it. I turned my data twice or three times. It's not possible. The overall live broadcast we observed may be 20% to 30% of the data that the notebook drives. It's not a double-level increase. So don't take live broadcasting as a traffic tool. But what is it? It's a transfer tool. That is to say, you have some traffic at the front now. You have some fans. But these people didn't get into your private domain. We call it a transfer. The transfer is a problem. Or these people don't talk to you after you get into your private domain. We also call it a transfer. It's a problem. Or he got to your private domain and talked to you. You talked to him, but he didn't buy your product. This is also a transfer. I think these three questions can be solved in the live broadcast room. Why? First of all, from the role of the flow of the live broadcast, it is helpful for the flow of the live broadcast. Why? Because you know the whole little red book about the restrictions on the flow of the flow. It's very strict. We have a lot of friends. Slightly. Just say a few more words. Send a few more private messages. Then it was reminded by the talk. The seven-day violation of the current flow. Right? Then if you enter the group chat, there are a lot of people in the group chat. Send a small advertisement. Then some people in the group chat are not willing to enter. Live broadcast is a better flow of the flow of the flow. So why did you send your mother to the live broadcast room? I use the live broadcast room a lot to do the flow of the flow. For example, we hang this one dollar. This information will say that we hang this kind of personal information. And so on. You are in the live broadcast room. Through the low price of some products to achieve the flow of the flow function. But the premise is that you have to have a certain flow. If you are completely out of flow now, don't think about this matter. And your notes have not been sent for a few days. Don't think about the live broadcast problem. OK? This is the effect of the flow of the flow. What is the second function? It's called the user doesn't talk after coming. The user doesn't talk. Basically, it's because the customer has no expectations for the service you provide. Or he doesn't think he should come to you. Can't see the brightness of your product. Otherwise, I don't know you provide this product. Otherwise, I don't know what your product characteristics are. It's his will. It's his will. It's not obvious. So when we are in the live broadcast, it's a lot of time to promote our product characteristics. You've seen my live broadcast. There should be a lot of friends who should have seen my live broadcast. Right? You can see that in my live broadcast, I will actually talk a lot about our own academic cases. We will talk about what my product looks like. It's actually doing a sales premise. It's a sales premise tool. This is the second function of live broadcast. The third one is called the user's thoughts. If he can't move now, you talked to him, but you can't move. So what is the probability? The probability is a sense of trust. Because when everyone is talking to you privately, it's one-to-one. Basically, it's talking in words. You don't have a face-to-face scene. You don't have a speaking scene. So your sense of trust will take time. More than that, maybe one month or two months. Less than that, maybe three or four weeks. But if it's through the live broadcast, you are a real person. Plus you will show your personality, your way of speaking. You are a whole person in front of everyone. It's a three-dimensional image. It's not a text. So your sense of trust will increase a lot. So basically, I just talked about these three points. Live broadcast is a service for transformation. It allows you to do one-to-one deep conversation when you don't have much time. It's a transformation tool. So what is the special feature of live broadcast? It's especially suitable for you. There is already a certain flow at the front end. Then your back-end products are also very clear. And your price-to-price products, relatively speaking, its price range may be between 100 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Or your product will be more expensive. But it has a low price When the drink is possible, then live broadcast is very suitable for you. To do one-to-one sales promotion. Its essence is a sales promotion tool. It's a sales promotion tool. Understand? OK, this is about live broadcast. The second point, I want to emphasize with everyone. Today, actually, when Honghong was sharing, I think I heard it myself. I think it may inspire everyone to do a few more things. There is another point besides live broadcast. You find that many of my friends when they post content, they like to post their own customer cases. To show that there is another case. There is another case. There is another case. And most of them are shown in the form of drawings. And what is the result? The customer sees your case is very good. Think your case is very good. Your case is very good. But you didn't show your service process. Then the user's expectation of your professionalism is not enough. It will lead to the user to ask you a question. How much money? Then it's gone. You find that you can't talk to him. It's like he asks you how much money. He asks you what this is. Then you finish introducing it and it's gone. Why? Because when you only show the case of the customer, only show the product, the user only pays attention to the product, only pays attention to the case, and does not pay attention to your service process, does not pay attention to your people. Understand? When you only provide products, the user only compares the product, only compares. Because you don't pay attention to the product, only compares. Because you don't show your service process, you don't show your personality. Then the customer only sees the product itself. This is the first point. So I'm telling all my friends, your in-depth content, customer cases and products, is to be counterproductive. Don't just give. Many people think of Xiaolongshu as their e-commerce store in operation or as a circle of friends in operation. All products and customer cases are all just given. Of course, customers will not have a deep trust in you. They may see it. They may think you are good. But the expectation of them to come to you to pay you to do the consultation will not be enough. So we always establish that this kind of direct product introduction direct to customer cases is not impossible, not at all, but it must control the proportion. Generally speaking, in an account, maybe there are two of these direct ones in ten content, but the rest are all software-based. This is what I want to tell you. This is a very important point. The second point is about the positioning. Today we have been talking about more details, more money to make. More details, more money to make. Because too many of our friends are starting to talk to me every day. I want to cut a big track. But the big track is on the little red book. In fact, there are already a lot of heads doing it. Have you found it? It's hard for you to make a difference. When your content is not as good as those big broadcasters, your expression ability is not as good as the big broadcasters, and then your overall scene construction is not as good as the big broadcasters. People are all taken with a camera. You have to take it with your phone. It's just that you can't PK it on a sense level. How do you go out? Even if your content is exactly the same as it is, your texture is 50% worse. Do you think your pen can be popular? It's hard to get popular. So at this time, I highly recommend to focus on the details when you are just starting out. Easy to make a difference. Today does not mean that you can only sell this product if you do the details. What is the detail? I will give an example. For example, the bird's nest in the two birds. For example, the new energy and AI industry in the product economy. For example, the J5 of studying in the UK. This is called a detail. It doesn't mean that I went to study in the UK today. J5. I can only do J5. Do you understand what I mean? This is a strategy of your front-end detail. When your users come in, all of them are J5. Right? He must be apart from J5. He has other people who can't meet his conditions. But it's easier for you to make a difference in the front-end detail. It allows you to make a difference with the head of this industry. It's easier to make the user have a very clear positioning impression of you. Take our choice today. For example, I will give you the simplest example. You mentioned Haifei. What do you think? What you have said, what do you remember. Come on, be fairness. What do you recall? What functions does Haifei have? What are the differences? What is your first impression of it? Haifei is Deactivation . Edward. But I ask you a question again. Do you think Haifei's shampoo questions really only deè aa例えば Ad penser sea surf. 99% of the washing water is the same. It's exactly the same. There is no big difference. In other words, the product of Haifei Si itself has no big difference between the effect of the washing water on the hair removal, the effect of the softening effect, and the effect of the skin care. It's just that it takes the most powerful point in the positioning layer. It may strengthen by 10% in the product formula design, but it chooses to make this point clear when it is marketing positioning. This is the importance of the classification and positioning I want to tell you. Today, you are in your notes to focus on the product of the washing water. It's not that you can only sell the washing water, but to make the user feel that you are a very professional washing water expert. But think about it, if you say this and that in your account today, and say that the next day, the user will have an unbearable impression of you. Of course, it will be a big difference. When you can't be impressed by your quality, when your quality is not very good, then it's actually very difficult for you to run out of the circle. So we call it the beginning of the beginner. When you just started, focusing on the details will make it easier to go out of the circle and make a difference. This is the second point I talked about. The third point is the expression problem of focusing on the user pain points. Many people don't know what the expression problem is. Just now, when Mr. Hong Hong was sharing, we talked about the part related to the user pain points. Many friends are really writing things. When you start a new business, you start from yourself, and you don't care what the user cares about at all. Let me tell you, the most important thing for the creative is to know what the user cares about. For example, let me give you another example. Today, we are going to say that what the user cares about the most when studying abroad. It's not just about my grades, what grades I have, what kind of school I can go to, my budget at home is so much, can I go to this school? My GPA is very ordinary now, right? Can I go to the school I want to go to? It's just that I care about these topics repeatedly. But many of you guys don't have the three key words in your brain about user pain points. When you are looking for a topic, you always start from your own product. You don't have a user's perspective. So if you can't focus on the user's pain points, the performance problem, you are sending things in your own way. You are talking about yourself, you feel like you are interested in the user, but the user is actually still focusing on the very performance problem. It's not even up to what you think. The very professional and very focused atmosphere you are talking about. Do you understand? This is what I want to tell you. The third point. The fourth point I want to tell you. Many of my friends come to me every day and say, Panman, can you help me see why my account is not good data? I want to tell you, many of you, 99% of the problems you think are difficult are not quality problems, but quantity problems. For example, the data is not good when you send notes. The core is probably because you send too little. Too little quantity will lead to several problems. The first problem is that your number is low. Your web experience and expressiveness are difficult to build up. This thing has a process from the surface to the side. I have been telling you for 20 days. You don't pay too much attention to this thing. Because in essence, within 20 days, you are practicing your expressiveness. You may not even speak to a very comfortable platform. Do you think the user will be comfortable? No. So the quantity does not change. You spend three or four days and your mind is broken. You think this thing is so difficult. How can this thing be so bad? It's the mental strength. Everyone must do a small number. Remember the threshold of this mental strength. I said 20 days is really 20 days. You try it. You just send 20 days of mouth-to-mouth. I don't believe your expressiveness will not rise. This is the first point I want to tell you. If your number does not accumulate, your return on loan probability will be low. Why? Because today's small book, it's a probability problem to make a loan. It's not a 100% stable problem. You just do a content today. No matter how good it is, no matter how perfect it is, after going out, it also depends on the probability. We are currently, for example, from the point of view of Panma, we are professional in this matter. The return on loan probability may be 10%. So it's simple. You didn't even post 10 days. How can you expect to have a report in it? Right? How can you expect that I will be fine as soon as I send the data? So, if you don't mention the return on loan before your number is accumulated, don't mention the data. Okay? This is the second point. The third point, if you don't have a bright spot, if you don't have enough light to support it, it's hard to find what kind of topic suits you. Because what suits each of us is different. Today, you put the script of another blogger on you, and talk about the same thing. It's very likely that the data difference will be very big. Because this topic is suitable for him to talk about, but it may not be suitable for you to talk about. You may not have a deep feeling about this topic. What you say is very private. So, if you don't have experience in what you say, the value of your emotion is not enough. The performance is not enough. Right? So, when you don't have a bright spot, you can't find your own style, what you are good at, you can't find it. So, most of the quality problems, from a micro-level point of view, are because of the lack of quantity. Many bosses can't sell their products because of the lack of quality. It's not about the quality, but because of the quantity. They can't find a large-scale market to match it. Then, many people think that I don't make enough money because I don't pay enough money. But, it's actually because of the information gap. There are too few external links. You can't create a large-scale value exchange. So, you don't see the essence of something. The third point, many people think that investment is difficult because of the lack of experience and the loss of knowledge. In fact, it's because he hasn't experienced a complete bull cycle overall. He has to finish 100 mistakes. Many problems will be solved. So, we call it the question of catching. You must look at the sample quantity. Sample quantity. Sample quantity. In the case of removing the sample quantity, you see a lot of things that you really don't know. You can't see them clearly. You can't see them clearly. You can't see them clearly. You can't see them clearly. Do you understand what I mean? So, I'm talking to you in the live broadcast today. Many of my friends just joined the company. It hasn't been long. I think that it's easy to learn in the legal level. But in the legal level, if your update rate doesn't go up, you don't say that you keep a high-level state of the update and every time you finish a piece, you go to see what the problem is. Then, you send it to the group and ask the teacher to help you see what the problem is. It will continue to be optimized. If you don't have this process, you will know more and more ways. You put all your classes on your mind about the little red book in your mind. It's useless if you don't practice. This is the fourth point I want to tell you. It's from the bright side to the change. It must be the number of accumulations. We now see a lot of students running well. Basically, I don't think their quality is much better than others. But in the number of updates, it must be basically a high-level update every week. Their own progress rate is very high. So, I want to share these with you. If you have any questions, you can go to the public screen. Tell me if you need to connect with me on the public screen. Come on. Okay. Let's start connecting now. Shuyu. I was scared by you. I just wanted to ask because I'm a B-end student. I don't know if I'm suitable to be a live streamer. I just wanted to ask this question. But I want to give you good information. Because I'm indeed a very good student who is very good at updating. I'm not a student who is good at updating. I'm a student who is very slow. I think I update every week. I think. Recently, this week, our company has been on leave for three days. Then I was crazy. I just updated three updates at once. Recently, Summer updated a lot of updates and she talked in detail. Then I updated an update at 8 a.m. today. The one about flying fish. Actually, Summer told me that this topic is rarely talked about on Xiaohongshu. Right? But today, the data is good. I may have added 100 fans today. Although she may not be a fan of Jinzhen, I think. But she posted this note. It's good. The data is good for me. I think what you said just now is that it's right to update at a higher level. I really don't have that much time. But if I have time, I will do it. I know. Because you are actually in the process of practice. You said that because in this process, you actually have to do a lot of things in the process. For example, if you find 10 topics, there is only one topic that is relatively popular. If you only do three topics, you can't find this topic. That's the problem. Yes. Yes. So, I just before you summed up, I just want to ask you because today there are more people talking about live streaming. Because I also saw that Pai Ma has a live streaming. And then I have a friend, Holly, she is also on live streaming. And then a friend of the painter is also on live streaming. And then there is a relatively famous online singer. She is a painter. A selling class. She also has a live streaming. There are many people on live streaming. But I don't know whether live streaming suits me. So I just wanted to ask because I don't know that much about live streaming. But you know more about it. So I wanted to ask you this question. I think it's like this, Shuyu. Let me ask you a question. Do you have any problems with your current clients? No, absolutely not. Right? Oh, this kind of situation, right? I think it's a efficiency tool. It's like you can understand because my thinking, for example, how many people do I have to add every day? I have to talk to them in depth. It's very difficult. But for you, every flow of money, you and him are deep. It's worth paying the cost of your online meeting, right? Because once he makes a deal, for you, your order is very large. So for you, you should do heavy sales. Yes, right. But live streaming is a sales promotion tool. It's like I have a team of people. And I'm also talking to many people about what they are suitable for. The traffic is large. But now my sales needs to be improved. I'm a team. And my customer base may not be that high. Maybe it's a little expensive, a few thousand yuan. Right? Then I'll focus on the live broadcast. Think about that area. You go live streaming. Your clients come to the live broadcast to talk to you. Maybe it's just a few people. For example, two or three people will talk to you in the live broadcast. It's a big difference between you and them on WeChat. Yes, I understand. I understand what you mean. OK. I understand. OK. OK. OK. OK. If you have any questions, you can contact me in private. Any other friends have any questions? If you want to connect to the live broadcast, let's connect to the live broadcast. I think today is a good opportunity. We can talk in a room. And then we can talk about your questions. And I think other friends will give you some suggestions. So don't be stressed. OK? Just be brief. There are many other friends who just came and haven't started yet. But it doesn't matter. If there is a live broadcast, you can talk to them in private. Or you can talk to them in private if you feel embarrassed. OK? But I find it really hard to talk to them in private. Everyone is more shy, right? Everyone is more shy. Don't be scared. I'm actually a very nice person. I'm just in this field. I want to force myself. Let me ask you. How did the 1.21 million data come from? I'm curious. I think you can tell us about it. OK. OK. Where did this data come from? I found it in his live broadcast. Because he opened a store, right? And he listed his products. His sales are directly reflected under his products. And his products are divided into three. The first one is a drink of 19.9 yuan. And then there are 4980 and 9980. These three products. And then each of them is listed in the product list of the product list. And his order is very clear. It's public. Everyone can see it. And then I put it together. Add it up. That's it. Oh, do you have to pay tax? Yes. Uh. Pay tax should be paid. Let me answer this question. Let me answer the question. The biggest problem with live broadcast deals is that the little dragon book will draw 5% of the draw points called platform service fee. And you you hit you except the service fee of this live broadcast. It comes to you. You need to pay tax. You need to pay tax. Of course, some people think it doesn't matter. It's not not found. It's not found. But if it's legal, you are going to the tax tax app every year to pay tax. It actually includes this part of the income. Oh, yes. Yes. His one million is all in the live broadcast. This is what I want to tell you. What is the point? His price is actually quite high. You see his main main product is about 5000 yuan. This product is 5000 yuan. It's been in the live broadcast for about eight months. It's been sold for more than 200 units. I want to tell you if your price is 1000 yuan This level of product can be directly sold in the live broadcast. So I highly recommend it because our little friends have a lot of knowledge to pay. There is a business track and a knowledge to pay. The price of 1000 yuan level of price is actually sold directly in the live broadcast. Do you understand what I mean? So for everyone this tool is actually a tool of efficiency. I I I think it's better to sell it for more than 5000 yuan. Yes. Generally speaking it's possible to sell it for 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 or 5000 yuan in the live broadcast at this price It's easy to sell. The latest survey of the Jiao Ba is not finished. Yes. From the point of view of the contract you must do this tax return action. OK. OK. Are there any other friends? Don't you have the demand of selling? I thought there were a lot of people today and then there should be some friends who want to connect the microphone. Are there any other friends who have any questions? If there are no questions we may almost end it. If there are any questions you can talk to me or you can directly connect the microphone. Today is a internal sharing so it's a bit casual. Open it more. I'm looking forward to it. Although I'm a bit nagging. I think there are no other friends, right? Everyone is a bit nagging today. Maybe because many of the friends just started today. There are more who just started. I looked at the comments. Is this the case? I have a question. You say. How many reviews should be updated every week? Because at the moment I have two reviews every week. And the data is not good. I think it's not good. I see. I think it's like this. It's related to your time and experience. It's like I I suggest you to judge first what is the state of your two reviews. Your two reviews are relatively in a relatively tight state. And then the two reviews are already full. Or these two reviews are actually fine. There is still a lot of time for the review. What is your situation? It's a good state. It's a good state. It's a good state, right? OK. If I were you, I think I might make two more three to four. I think I'll make three to four. Because actually the English you did the English track I think your current state whether it's from your expression or from your is the overall editing style I don't think there is much of a problem. The biggest problem is to touch on the topic that suits you. This is to be analyzed. Right? Because actually we are now not likely to say that I spent a week to carefully polish a notebook and then it broke. The chance is very, very small. It's probably every notebook we may be 70 points. But I publish four videos every week 70 points and then go to see the coverage. Then go to see the coverage. But we just say we still have to reach 70 points for this notebook. It can't be very bad content. But after we have reviewed the notebook is at 70 points of this level. So I still like you or put the update frequency a little bit to raise it. There is also a question about the detail of the track. Just now also emphasize that it is said to be to be detailed this track is even more detailed because I think like for example English Qilong it is already a detail of English this track that according to this meaning I can still go down in detail? Yes. We are now doing English many friends are very detailed. We are doing English KTPET specifically to do the introduction of some original textbook what's what the that is it will be detailed to this is to be detailed it only focuses on one or two tests and one or two textbooks so it can definitely be further detailed for example some are specifically talking about what power up this kind of this kind of words they may be more suitable for the students to understand the language and the language itself is the language teacher not the professional one yes and then in my this direction I think it is more difficult to find this in the field of the division yes the same what are you looking at recently you just you just keep outputting this the topic is good you always have to rely on something right you can't always be very bad in learning I believe you and your children are in the same field yes yes right so in comparison I think now the English language is very difficult to rely on the grammar just talking about free apps because there are too many people you know there are too many people and you have to think about what is the problem is your knowledge how to combine the products of the post-payment because I have told you this question before why do the vertical classification this thing can run through because vertical classification means what I have to do to get the most out of it I have to do some of the so-called cash flow to be honest I deliberately don't go after that kind of cash flow topic I'm chasing a relatively relatively more detailed topic but why can we accept this thing is because I don't need to do the flow I just need I'm interested in this textbook of power up today parents come in maybe this note only 20 likes but he may bring me five accurate information but I can have products afterwards is this logic is your first consideration but if you today's transformation logic changed you become I want to do ads I want to do delivery then our flow of the selection still has to maintain a certain proportion I still have to try to go to the package but this difficulty I tell the truth I am very honest this year's difficulty is higher than before because this year the whole small book the big flow went to the live broadcast room and the bookstore all the packages are decreasing not to say the problem of the track today we have to do the mother's camp of the little friends right you dare to say mother's camp such a big flow of the track this year these few months are actually more and more difficult since the start of the live broadcast I understand thank you Panma it's okay it's okay there are still friends on the microphone I'm here again I have you say first you say first you say first I say first okay I say first this is Panma has a question because you didn't say that before you said that like those case-by-case notes those notes that only give students cases like try not to give them directly but like those because I don't have a high rate of updating because I feel if for example I take a class after I take a class I give it to her every night after class there's not much time so for example when I have classes the update will be more full so but like that people will here and use privacy to mouth you know so I have a suggestion for you. First of all, you have a special point in this track. Because you are a typical... Let me talk about the background. Because our partner is doing interview training for the exam. This track is very, very rigid. It's really that people who come to you may be the victors of life. It's set in this place. So you will find that your back spin is relatively... I'm not talking about the high-speed turn. At least, if you add your private customers, they don't have a big problem with turning low-cost orders. It's because they are really the best. Really the best. So you send pure case-based type. It's not a big problem for you to turn some low-cost products. But this is not suitable for all tracks. Especially some of you are teaching what to make money. You only have one. How much money did my student earn? This case can't be touched. Because you have special features. I want to say this first. Your track has special features. So you add a case. What is it? You can add a case. But I suggest you can't add all cases. Why? Because if you add all cases, people will lose their trust in you. This is what we have done countless times. You have your own feelings. After you post a video with trust, your trust will be improved. So it's a proportion problem. Right? So my suggestion is you upload one to two videos a week. And the rest, for example, two videos are pictures. One is cases. The other is your previous one. The kind of technical analysis. And then, OK. After you upload this proportion, your real person's progress is two videos. Don't you think two videos are a bit stressful? I want to tell you two ways. The first way is you don't record one video. Don't write one video, record one video, write one video, record one video. You just take a day to take all the materials for the next week. For you, it may be two scripts or three scripts. Right? Focus on shooting. Focus on editing. It will be better. Second, you have published a real-life report before. Dear, today is the topic of the summer. The topic of the summer. You can't do it. You can't do it. This is the point of the summer. You have published a report. You will not repeat it. You will not write scripts again. Just change it a bit. Change it a bit. And then, you can shoot it again. Can you reduce your time cost? Even I have talked to many students before. The notes you have published should be used in three ways. The first way is this note was published. Under the circumstance that I did not change anything, I changed the cover. I will post it again. I will post it again in my account. This is the first step. The second step is called I will put the corner of my note in the corner of my note. It is called the corner of the note. The second step is called the corner of my note. I will not change the corner of my note. I will record it again. I will post it again. I will use this corner of my note repeatedly. Do you understand? So, you can reduce your production cost in this way. But I think the proportion of the students should be guaranteed. Otherwise, your amount will be increased. But the conversion of the back end is especially difficult because of the high price. What is the price of your class? Have you checked it? Yes, I have checked it. But I feel that the price is different depending on the number of fans. Their price is different from the number of students in the class. It is quite a lot. But most of them are less than 1000 yuan. For example, it is less than 100 yuan in one hour. But usually, it is sold for 10 hours. Yes. I understand. Yes. Because you have to make a high-end class. The higher you go to the high-end class, the higher the requirement for credibility. The customer case is all in the customer case. The picture of the customer case can be faked. Yes. That's right. Right? Yes. And the class is called high-end class. I heard that the price is too low, so I increased the price for one hour. But I have several inquiries that I felt that they would say the price is a little bit too high. Like this, though I said the same as you said about the content and quality of my service to him, but maybe they saw the price it was lower than their mental price. Because they feel that they are already higher than their psychological level. If you tell them again, it's a little difficult. They will still feel a little high. Okay, I'll tell you. Then they will say, think about it. Then there will be no more questions. Okay, let me tell you a point. Basically, it's because your front-end personnel are not enough. Because your front-end has, now your front-end actually has a certain proportion of real people coming out. First of all, this proportion is not very high. This is the first one. The second one is that you are talking about dry goods in the proportion of real people coming out, right? But did you tell them that you are different from other teachers? The proportion of personal documents. Right? I want to give you an example. Tell me my example. Because if I tell you my example, the people who are listening today should know it very clearly. I don't know if you have felt recently that you have been typing a lot of personal documents in the current period, in the recent period. What is my personal document typing? What do I type? Similar to what I write. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? I wrote this I I started to write this post hard At that time, many people have taken notes on this . Have a lot of feedback and give you the closing surveys about what I should do, what they are about. Based on that, you came to little Red Book to teach people how to write,谁 Why does he come to you and not to others? Not to those low-end ones Must be because your own product Is different from others But this part Your related topics are too few This kind of topic is called the human-to-human topic Plus product Is directly related to your product topic For example, in my industry This is similar to For example, why don't I recommend you to find a single cloud Because a lot of people come to me They may consider Find a single cloud or go to paypal right They will compare like this Maybe there are different teachers They will also Everyone will compare But why would you choose Paypal I must be because Except for the product I must also have from the human side From my own teaching style To attract everyone's points But this part You are too few in the front This is still a service process Do you show your service process And your service advantage Understand Understand Then there is another point Did you make your circle of friends? Circle of friends There are some friends Is Circle of friends sent more cases Including some comments from the school And some advice from the school This is a little more Don't just send this If you send this Everyone will compare Whose case is better Right Is this point Is it more than whose school Because you didn't let others compare What should you compare Xin Yi, you should compare You yourself Right You are on the subject of the exam You are actually very good Very experienced in the industry You have experienced a lot of difficulties And you are in the process of graduating You have a lot of initials Including your teaching style What's the difference You just have to show this Take your work number As your life circle But in the life circle If it's related to your work But don't send it All product content Customer case value Should be down to you Twenty to thirty percent content What should be the remaining seventy percent Your thinking about the industry And where is your person? Well Thank you He understands me Logic What do you send the circle of friends to Jian Hong The circle of friends is what I just said Right Actually, Jian Hong and we were talking about it I must have told you at the time of the examination There are several categories in the circle of friends We one is called the product circle One is called the professional circle One is called the life circle Right What does the product circle mean It's related to your product But your product can't be released every day 产品好呀好呀好呀你就发一些硬广告不是这样子的你的产品圈里面发的应该是什么第一从你的客户证言来证明你这个产品好第二你去看说比如说类似于一些产品的一些成交记录来证明你的产品好还有比如说你自己去你比如说你去你去外地去选这种成皮啦你自己的一些工作日常啦然后去体现你在这个事情上面你的筛选标准很严格啦去凸显你的产品好就是从都是那种从侧面去凸显产品好的圈我们叫做产品圈哈这个是一个部分第二个部分叫做你的专业圈专业圈是什么意思就是你你待在这个专业的你怎么看养生行业啊养生行业有哪些乱象啊为什么你今天每天你就是要要守在守在档口里面你每天在这个档口里面你看到了一些什么你引发了你一些什么样子的思考你跟同行相比你觉得你有什么样子的思考不一样的对于养生这个行业的一些启发也好观点也好就叫做专业圈生活圈就是你平时你作为一个人你为什么我今天要找建很因为建很你是一个极其靠谱的人你是一个做人优先于做事你觉得做生意先要做人这是你的价值观对吧你把你这个东西从你的生活圈里面去凸显这里面一定就会有客户故事有你跟你家人处理关系的故事有你跟你同事的关系有你的你跟你供应商的故事通过这些故事来去体现你的生活是一个靠谱的人大概逻辑是这个理解吧就是多方位的去凸显而不要天天就发案例案例案例产品产品产品海报海报海报好的好的好的哎呀好的嗯那我其他没什么问题了好的嗯好的ok其他小伙伴还有要上麦的不哦嗯我又差一句好不好你说嘛嗯嗯就是我就发现我的承担他承担的概率其实会比较低因为我们的这个客单价值的超级高对不对嗯所以我在想有没有可能走其他一种变现方式不仅仅只是这一种这样是不是会更多元一些或者是我的反馈正面性会更好一些嗯就是我最近在想的一个问题啊嗯比如说你有思考有比如说有哪些方向这样吗我也不知道就是因为我我的同同就是跟我关系很好的同事我们有时候经常下班回家就跟我说哎呀书一我觉得你很会总结很很自己本来一些工作你别的做完了但是我会认识工作里面自己会做很多很多的总结分享给他们他说哦好像是这样听你说完之后他觉得你真的很适合去我也不知道就是比如说录一些课去卖呀之类的啊就是类似这种吧其他的种变现方式可以在我这个基础上做延展的嗯我跟你讲啊就是基本上来讲卖课是得什么呢就是卖课是你在某个行业里面要取得非常大的成绩之后你卖课才能够有比较好的结果所以我的问题就是你要卖什么课比如说你今天叫做你今天卖一个课叫做我教你怎么去做接这种亲子乐园的这种项目你自己要先要有有案例出去而且这种案例不能是通过你公司接的单呀你得是自己跑过这个闭环的你才能去赋能同行你理解我这个意思吗就是你要搞培训这个对可能不是这个这种方式方式就比如说呃就比如说啊就教你做亲子乐园设计比如说啊我也不知道我也就瞎讲了一下或者其他什么的做什么设计教你做亲子乐园的设计嗯嗯哦了解但是我我通过我对于群体的了解小b老板不需要就是这种东西他需要的就是具体项目落地嗯你如果说是嗯嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,嗯,呢 ,是您 exciting distance Vamos You can actually learn this thing, you can land it, you can make a little tree. But if you just give your client to class today, do you think he can open this green park? I'll leave this question to you, you can think about it. So recently I'm thinking about it, but I'm thinking about it. If there is something more formal, I'll talk to you. Yes, and I think there is another point of consideration. That is, do you want to do such a high-end unit in your customer group? This is also a question you have to think about. To put it bluntly, it is a large-scale client on Xiaotongshu. Because I know it's not your industry. For example, I know some industries are similar to family trust, or overseas asset allocation, which is also a super high-end unit. Maybe one unit is worth hundreds of thousands. Basically, their follow-up cycle is more than half a year, and it is frequent. Yes, we are almost the same. It also needs at least three to four years. Yes, we are almost the same. It also needs at least three to four years. Yes, we are almost the same. It also needs at least three to four years. Then wait for him to finish it, even a year and a half. Yes, this is an industry that cannot be reversed. It's just that you have to have the ability to be a sales consultant offline. It's actually a test of your point. Right? You can't just say that you have to set a six-month cycle. I said two months. This is hard. So if you want to do this industry, you have to accept it. The offline cycle of the industry is like this. Unless you go to the company. You can't reduce the price of the unit. Don't just say that my unit price may be, for example, For example, some of our customers, for example, I told you before. We have offline garden design here. Its unit price is about 100,000. The trading cycle is very short. Relatively short. It's not very short. Maybe two weeks to a month. This trading cycle is set. Right? It's linked to the trading volume. You can't ask me to do a big order again. Then my sales cycle is going to be short again. How can it be so good? Yes, it's not. So I'm thinking about it. Other way of transformation. Or shortening the price of this order. Something like that. I think it's through experience to comprehensive assessment. I think it's for you. Is it going to be a small coin market? Or a medium coin market? Each has its own good. It's basically related to your ability boundary. If you say you think doing sales is very painful for you. You may want to shorten the sales cycle. Maybe this is a way. But it will bring another coin. It's called your overall. Your customers may not have a very high price. Then the pure energy of your project will be your card. I'm doing all the big B in the company now. I actually looked at all the sessions. Just super big B. Then I'm on the small book. You can only do small B or at most do medium B. I think it's this kind of thing. It's just from the technical side. Or from the eye industry. There must be no problem. It's just whether he can see me. Is it our deal? Can it be achieved in any probability? Right? Yes. Yes. I'm you. I'll grab it hard. Now the offline sales. Okay. Right? You don't have to worry so much when you come back. You really. You can make a deal among these few consulting customers. Right? You don't have to worry. But maybe it's just a few more things. Yes. Okay. Let's get started. Okay. Shuyin. Okay. Alas, he's also used the horoscopes. You also, the story that the you also are you talkin, efficient Mao Xi is watching. All right! So all that food might not become free. Great. Don't worry. You know, I love the universe. All right. Come back. See if there's anything wrong? Have you released the poster yet? The poster... hasn't been released yet I have two notes Okay, how are the notes and data going? I haven't posted them yet You haven't posted them yet? Okay I thought I would post them in September I understand I will go back to that question, Gina I think that live streaming is a tool for efficiency Do you have more customers now that you can't sell them? I haven't posted the C-section yet I haven't started the B-section yet Right? I think that you are a bit early to start live streaming What do you mean by that? You have started posting your notes and many people are adding you and when you add them to WeChat you will find that you are talking to many people and their questions are similar to yours At this time, you can consider starting live streaming Oh, like this Yes, because your flow is based on the notes Live streaming is not a flow tool It is a tool that helps you to make your flow faster and to speed up your sales process For example, you are busy in class and you don't have much time to talk to people and you can't talk to 20 people at the same time That is the logic Okay, okay Let's start with the notes and look at the data in September Yes Gina, I think that your point is the core of what we are talking about today For you, the application should be very strong Because you I will talk about it Gina is doing yoga Now she wants to do the same-sex co-working She wants to be a yoga teacher She will teach them a set of courses and teach them how to do yoga and some of the front-end and how to do flow and sales It is actually the logic of co-working co-working Co-working is like starting a business Basically, you are teaching customers how to start a business So, what Mr. Hong Hong said today is the most important thing You are too conservative It is about how much money you make You don't dare to talk about it You don't need to talk about it You don't have confidence in it It will affect your customers very much I am very honest with you Including Shuyun, you also have this question When you talk about how much money this customer makes in this project and how much money I make you will feel uncomfortable I do feel uncomfortable But actually, because I do big business I don't tell you a lot of data I will go to the I will go to the I will go to the general range And this thing What can I do even if it is not accurate? What can I do even if it is not accurate? What can I do even if it is not accurate? I just want to ask you this question Just lie to others Why is your project not making money? Just to be honest It originally made 50 million You made 60 million Is this really a big problem? This is not big Right? This is a question of flexibility Right? Don't just keep on playing When you play all the business channels The hot topics you see Gina, I sent you a lot before Your colleagues, teachers who are teaching What are they writing? I am a yoga studio for one person One month, 100,000 people Is this easy to destroy? So you You must sell this I just want to say This I don't know where to start I don't know where to start Not like the C-section It seems to be very smooth It's easy to connect Because this belongs to a relatively new field Because this belongs to a relatively new field I don't know if I can turn it over Certainly It's according to the strategy we gave you Why? Because I tell you The most important thing to do at the B-section How much money can it make? Your colleagues are concerned about this You open a yoga studio You do some private teaching How much can you earn in a month? Then I am in your technology I may not be able to hit you completely Hit me eight times This is the logic You are in the same industry as you are in the same industry So you follow the set we gave you Is to use the approach of the entrepreneurial track To do your 2B training This logic is completely possible I just want to do the course first I just want to do the course first Maybe not yet Do the course first Do the course first Don't think about the course first I said that the course can be updated gradually Do the course first The course can be sold first Then you do For example, do a 5-day course first Then continue to update Then some courses can't be followed Teach one by one Make this thing more sophisticated Don't make it very complicated Otherwise you will be stuck here The course is They said to do pre-sale first If someone buys it, then force you to do the course Is that poster Is it for introducing the course after she came to Siyu? Or is it a note on the small red book platform? Both can be used Both places can be used Oh Are there posters on the small red book? Can send one But don't all All are no one to see Oh, I understand OK Any other questions? If you have any questions, you can just sell it directly If you have any questions, you can just sell it directly It seems that there are no other friends It seems that there are no other friends OK That's about it for today It's 10.40 I will send you a simple questionnaire I will send you a simple questionnaire later, please give me some feedback Because we also want to Our B-MEN meeting This thing is better polished That is to say, about this For example, the theme or some details Then the link link Do you think there is any room for optimization? Give us some feedback, OK? Then we will also follow everyone's feedback Continue to relay our products That's all for today Thank you for coming to the discussion of B-MEN meeting Then we will see you next time Then if you have any questions You are also welcome to contact us on the corporate WeChat Bye bye",

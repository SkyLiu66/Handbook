The Tao of Heaven takes from those who have too much and gives to those who are in want. The people's way is not like that. They take from those who are in want and give to those who have too much. Yet who is able to have enough to give it to the world? Only the one who has Tao. Therefore, the sage toils but expects no praise. He does his work but does not dwell on it. He does not wish to make a display of his merit. We've talked a lot in this series so far about how the sage takes the needs of others and treats them like his or her own. Lao Tzu speaks of the bending of a bow. When a bow is drawn, the top and bottom are both drawn toward the middle. What is high is made low and what is low is made high. I don't think this image is only some kind of economic theory. While this idea certainly can't apply to helping those who are economically disadvantaged, it can apply to everything we do. Whatever we have a lot of, whether that be money, talent, knowledge, even humor, we can share this gift with others. Everyone has something more abundantly than those around him or her. Whatever it is we are abundant in, these things have value to others and should be shared. With all that said, Lao Tzu poses this question. Is there anybody who has abundantly enough to share their excess with the whole world? Is this even possible? It is only possible, he claims, if such a person is one with Tao. Anyone else who seeks to change the entire world will probably cause more harm than good. The Tao is the only thing that can supply enough excess for the entire world to benefit from. To think that we can do this on our own is foolishness. The sage understands this. Thus, he or she is focused on being one with Tao. And when this is done, he enjoys the increased capacity that the Tao brings. Because he does not desire to have more than others, he is not concerned with praise or taking credit for what he does. When he has done a task, he takes joy in it and then moves on to the next task. His motivation is not to impress others, but to emulate Tao. Thanks for watching, and I will see you all tomorrow for Chapter 78. Peace and blessings.",

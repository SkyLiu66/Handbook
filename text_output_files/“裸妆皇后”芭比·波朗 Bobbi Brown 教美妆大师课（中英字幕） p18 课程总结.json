But I've also learned how much I really care about sharing stories and telling you my journey so it will encourage you on your own. My advice to all you guys out there, whether you're a future makeup artist or passionate about what you're doing, know that anything is possible. That's a wrap. You have to work hard and you have to just keep at it. I'm running on fumes. And just realize you have to be nice to people. If you're not nice, no one's going to want to be around you. And if you are not the first one jumping up to say, I got this. I could do it. You're not going to get rehired. Even when you're on a set, if you are just sitting there on your phone and no one's doing anything, guess what? You should not just be sitting there. Someone might need some help. You know, the model should have maybe a glass of water. The photographer might need some help. Maybe there's a dog sitting around the set. Ask if you could take the dog out. Like, just get out of your own way and just be the best person you could be in your life and at work. What I hope you do after you watch this class is watch it again and again. Because guess what? It takes practice. It takes time to learn the techniques. Go back. Look in the mirror. Practice. Grab someone. Do their makeup. Practice. And I hope that what I've taught you, you'll be able to take and just become a better version of yourself. Through health and wellness. Through creativity. Careers. Through makeup. Through everything. Thank you so much for watching. I'll see you next time.",

Therefore the sage wants to remain behind, but finds himself at the head of others. Reckons himself out, but finds himself safe and secure. Is it not because he is selfless that his self is realized? So this chapter presents the idea of heaven and earth not living for themselves, and that it is for this reason that they are so long lived. Living for oneself is exhausting. Self-centeredness and self-preservation are very demanding states of mind. Impatience weighs on your soul and snatches up the happiness of the present moment, as it always points towards something in the future. A person who desperately guards the things they desire or to which they feel entitled will be haunted by phantoms of the future, either fear or hope. A person that is simply living in and observing the present moment is open to the future. He is open to all the joy, satisfaction, and opportunities available in the present moment, while a person consumed by self-interest will be blinded to many of these things. I remember one time in my life while serving in a volunteer capacity, I had a desire for a leadership position within the organization. These leadership roles were rotated regularly and appointed by the leaders of the organization. I felt that a leadership position in the organization would help me feel somehow legitimized, like I was good enough of a person to be asked to lead. But I was not. But the position never came. I got so worked up about this that whenever I thought about it, it caused me a lot of frustration and anxiety. Was there a reason why others around me were getting put into these positions and I wasn't? Was there something wrong with me? Well, I think the best possible thing that could have happened, happened. I was appointed to a mid-level leadership position for a short period of time and then released from that position again. Surprisingly, I felt a sort of freedom after this. I suddenly realized, having been on both ends, how little it mattered. Leadership positions don't exist to legitimize the person serving in them. They exist to serve the people being led. Therefore, the sage is perfectly fine to act in whatever capacity he finds himself in, but finds himself in leadership capacities anyway. In the words of Albus Dumbledore, It is a curious thing, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they were it well. Another translation of the latter half of chapter 7 reads, The master puts herself last, and finds herself in the place of authority. She detaches herself from all things. Therefore she is united with all things. She gives no thought to self. She is perfectly fulfilled. Ultimately, being fulfilled is what we all want. But I don't think we can become fulfilled by striving to be fulfilled, by chasing after things, or by accomplishing some goal in the future. We become fulfilled by being able to do away with the clamor, the clamor of self-will, so that we can see and feel in the present moment the influence of our intuition, which will guide us in the direction of what our souls came to achieve. It is only in losing ourselves that we eventually find ourselves. Thanks for watching, and I'll see you guys next time for chapter 8.",

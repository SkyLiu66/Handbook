    "data": " I kind of want to move to now I think your newest yeah the more professional side so we have the more entry-level you want to shoot with your smartphone then this is the more entry-level camera itself you said this was about I would say it started it was like a 2000 and with the lens and everything because the lens is pretty expensive this is a 12 to 35 2.8 this is equivalent to the 18 to 35 1.8 but 1.8 2.8 and we'll get to back to this lens but this one I know you can get it way lower than what it is and they already made better versions like s the s1 which is a third full-frame flagship right and these cameras the Panasonic are just workhorses and what the one thing that you will the trade-off is the yeah the autofocus maybe not that great but it's a good overall like you I think it's a good camera if you want something where you can you can just change colors and like really work on it this is the camera and the files ain't so huge either and you can use SD cards which is awesome you know use two of them it's a good camera it's a good photo camera too it has good skin colors and that's what I look for is like something with good coloring and dynamic range and yeah and that's why I like this one and I still use it to this day as maybe camp I just have to match it and something is a pain but I got good enough at coloring that I can actually make it look like you know any right and that's something that's a really good point actually is the practicality versus the payoff of the footage you get I think a lot of the times we can be like I need this stabilizer and I need to buy this and buy that and buy this and buy that some equipment that you purchase you will use one on every 10 times you shoot once in a blue moon the other stuff is things go in and out of trend on the way that they look at one point those lens baby distorted lenses were so popular and they would create these cool distortions now the whole prism in front of the lens is pretty popular so you really want to keep in mind that you're you want to buy with longevity you know like you can get away with the stabilization on your smartphone probably if you want to buy one of those like 60 70 80 dollar gimbals for the smartphone you can but it's just something to keep in mind that the as stuff changes now the really smoothness of a handheld shot on the r5 to me aesthetically actual looks better in a lot of situations than the straight up gimbal shot so yeah what was your opinion on the footage you saw on the r5 i loved the footage so of course we all went through the footage at the beginning of the course together and the r5 i had it side by side with the 1dx mark ii that we're shooting on right now for this main camera and the coloring the smoothness i really liked color correcting this footage i was able to really make it look how i wanted to which was really good and i was blown away because i'm filming behind the scenes of you and then you're doing a handheld shot and walking that was your old yoga yeah yeah like straight up so all the video techniques i learned in the past like what 10 years ago i want to say seven years a long time i learned it from this guy yeah this guy is the one that those yoga videos like when i was watching the footage i'm like oh pac-man he's doing this with every shot yes i love it it's because like that's the best way to do it i mean just learning how to do your stepping and all that but the reason why i got this camera i had sony's right i've had the a6500 i had the a72 i had the a73其实我不在威風的做 planets a7r3 but those are my photo cameras a7 iii Juan 가�GBR回归 你们用的下落 government seven was actually a good camera and if you're someone that can afford a7 iii was on screen d и Ny sano mezstudio camera that just came out i see it ls a good camera but anyone can afford the r3 hd这一台 already just came out the a7sony a7r3 is a great camera still to this day great auto focus great everything you know but don't get stuck in the Egg fine dontyou get stuck in t technical stuff because it's not really about helm Мarmed的技术的事情 the technical is about the story the only reason repetition it's not about the technical it's story the only reason why I got this camera is because the clients that I deal with it's beauty right and and they just love Canon color and they always ask for Canon they always give me gifts about it so what is the main reason that you went with the r5 so once the main reason was why I switch everything from Sony to Canon was the glass I just love the glass I've always loved it and I've already have it so I don't need to like I won't lose money if I switch over and the stabilization the stabilization and the codecs so the codec I mean like the 10-bit 422 that sort of thing and can you explain that briefly so I get more range of color like I mean everything now is giving you 422 10 bit now and just having 10 bit is fine there's some cameras like this one does 12 bit right and the area Alexa the more higher and like red that was like 16 I think or I don't know like really high numbers but those are high data this camera I mean I can shoot 10 bit 422 all day and that that gives me the flexibility to go in post and really play with the color if I feel that it's wrong or my my black saying to black you know and that's something that happens a lot where I lose the blacks and it's kind of like this faded grainy look and I just I can push and pull you know yeah lift the person out of a dark environment and give them a bright look without sacrificing artifacts and stuff like that and those are technical things but it's it's I'm not telling I should not deter you from telling a story because all this is doing is telling a story I mean you are a creative and the creative should be not limited by their gear and that's something that you taught me I think and a couple other young people on set and I've seen a lot of huge professionals on set like like Tony Duran all right and those guys they just go with a cannon and they're just like doing like what I was doing and their shots look amazing you know and I think that's what I'm trying to do is I'm just trying to do what I'm doing and I think that's what I'm trying to do is I'm just like the I did that one thing with Kim Kardashian and that was done for the holiday campaign that was done with a Canon 5d mark for yeah you know and he said set it up for me you know they all right I put it in 1080 because he does not like shooting in 4k he finds it very hard for himself to edit so I'm just like wait what like I'm like I got this dope camera here man let's just use this and he was like no no no no that's like it's too much for me like I need I need under like a few hundred gigs because he doesn't want to do with five and then I when I saw the after the always because he threw all these layers and they already have like a look to it because it's social media but when you want to go into like film like real film then then we start going into these big boys right this camera the pocket 6k literally does everything I needed to do yeah I mean I can do a commercial job on this I could do weddings I could do the stuff anything I needed to do it could do it just the file sizes are huge but what I like about this camera a lot then then all these is that it's bare bones then what I mean by that is it's a camera that's like a camera that's like a that is I can't plug and play I could put a hard modular uses canon mouth you know I mean it uses a super 35 sensor with so like don't get wrong about like micro four-thirds full-frame and a super 35 all that doesn't matter as long as it can handle the 10-bit 422 and and it can transcode it out of a nice file structure that you you are able to edit on your computer because some people don't have supercomputers and and like high-end Mac and stuff like that. And I don't have a high end Mac and I use a Premier or DaVinci and literally just throw that in there and it's ready to go. I don't have to transcode, you know? Yeah, I think one thing to mention too that makes this large leap is that these all shoot, these three shoot photo and video. That means they both, they shoot both of those things pretty well. When you get to something like this, this is just for video. So it's gonna do just video really well. It's kind of like similar between a zoom lens and a prime lens. A zoom lens is gonna get you a multitude of different focal lengths and it's gonna do each focal length really well. But a prime lens is gonna get you, like for this example, this is a what, 28 or 50? 50, right? Yeah, this is a 50. It's gonna only shoot a 50 mil, but it's gonna do 50 mil really well. So 50 mil on this compared to 50 mil on this is gonna be like day and night. This is the same thing. Where it doesn't do multiple things, it does one thing really well. And what's the price point of the? So this one, like, that's the camera body alone. I think you can get it for now. See, this Blackmagic, Blackmagic wants the filmmaker, the indie filmmaker to thrive and like you say, no compromises in being creative. And they put in all that software, like ProRes, all the things that when you go and edit, you don't have to transfer. You don't have to do it. It's just ready to go, edit. And it's just like a plug and play camera. And I love that about this camera. And what I like about it is they give you so many IO options, like audio, they even give you an auxiliary for you could put professional microphones. So you don't have to go and buy these expensive microphones, like a Zoom, you know, H5 or any of that. It's all built in. There's a, there's phantom power, there's everything. And I, and so for the body, I think, you know, it's a little bit more expensive than the other ones. Yeah. I think you can get them for like 2100, which is not bad. I mean, this was what, 3,500, 3,800. And that's just the body and the lens is another grand. Right. So I did spend a lot of money. The only reason why I got this is because I needed something to run and gun. I mean, there's scenarios where I need run and gunning. And this one, I can't do it. I can, cause I can put it against my chest and shoot. But how long can I do that without getting tired? And also there is limitations in this camera, but other than that, you're getting this camera. If you want cinema, quality imagery and the files to be able to do all types of things, you know what I mean? You will be spending a lot of money on cards and possibly batteries, but I rigged this up so I can use V-mount. So V-mount is kind of like a standard, V-mount and gold mount are standard batteries. And I highly suggest anybody that wants to really get into it is get V-mount batteries or gold mount. V-mount is my favorite cause they're really affordable. And then you can, you can last for days on, I mean, not for days, I'm sorry. You can last for six hours to eight hours plus on just one battery. And this battery will power your monitor, your, your lavalier mics, your, your antennas. Cause I have an antenna that stick. So this whole rig, Tilta is rigged up so I can put an antenna. I can put a monitor, I can put a, you know, just all kinds of rigging materials. I can hang it off of a ceiling or this pin. So that's what I, that's why it looks like a cheese plate. Yeah. Because I need those holes to like mute, I'm moving around or take this off and you know what I mean? Turn it this way, use it as a handle. You know what I mean? So it's a very modular system, like extremely.",

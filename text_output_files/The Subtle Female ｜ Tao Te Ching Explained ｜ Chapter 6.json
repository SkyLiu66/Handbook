It is there within us all the while. Draw upon it as you will, it never runs dry. So rather than just interpreting this chapter, I'd like to just lay a bit of groundwork to hopefully let you use your own intuition, and to draw your own conclusions about it. The valley spirit mentioned in the third line has also been translated as the spirit of emptiness, or even just the Tao. The doorway of the mysterious female, sometimes rendered as the subtle female, has been sometimes suggested to allude to the gateway of a woman's womb. All throughout the Tao Te Ching, the traditional characteristics of the female, i.e. submissiveness, humility, quietness, generosity, etc., are applauded and endorsed. The Tao Te Ching certainly is one of the few ancient texts to do this. It would have been in pretty stark contrast to the prescribed cultural norms for men of Lao Tzu's day. In today's day, this runs counter to the culturally prescribed norms for men of Lao Tzu's day. As many of these quote-unquote traditionally feminine characteristics have begun to fall out of favor even for women. Please understand that neither I nor Lao Tzu are making any political statements about equality or gender roles. Lao Tzu was not putting one sex above another. Rather, he was encouraging both men and women to cultivate in themselves certain human characteristics above others. This was radical then, and it's radical now, not because of any political implications, but because of its endorsement of human qualities that are and were supremely undervalued. The Tao is often described in terms of these traits. So what do you think this means for us? I understand that whenever we talk about things like gender, there is a potential for things to get political. So let's just be kind to each other in the comments and have a quality discussion without putting words in each other's mouths, as I'm sure Lao Tzu would have done. And I'll see you all tomorrow for chapter 7.",

So what I'm going to do is we have our scenario here and we're going to have our subject, Vlats, and he's going to be basically doing the same movement twice. And it's all going to make sense at the end of the edit, I promise you. But I wanted to shoot on an iPhone to kind of show you, you can string shots together that look really good, just like shooting with a DSLR or mirrorless camera. And you can use a smartphone. I'm going to be doing 240 frames a second for a dramatic effect for the video. So I'm going to be using frame rate. I'm going to be using movement. I'm going to be using camera placement. And I'm going to be using a series of shots back to back that create a punchline, a really cool kind of final product. So Vlats is going to be standing here. He's going to do the same movement twice. And we're going to have this quartz light that is going to be going through this 36-inch circular diffuser lighting our scene. We have the windows closed in the background. This is less about getting really good lighting. And this is more about if you have an idea on your phone, an idea that you want to just shoot more easily for maybe an Instagram. Or something that's a little bit less produced. I just want to show you another way that you can do a cool vertical video. It doesn't always have to be a big fancy thing with a large shot list. Although that is an excellent tool. But with that said, let's get into the edit. No, wait, no. It's not an edit. We're not editing. But with all that said, let's get into shooting this idea.",

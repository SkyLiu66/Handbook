The more laws and restrictions there are, the poorer people become. The sharper men's weapons, the more trouble in the land. The more ingenious and clever men are, the more strange things happen. The more rules and regulations, the more thieves and robbers. Therefore, the sage says, I take no action and people are reformed. I enjoy peace and people become honest. I do nothing and people become rich. I have no desires and people return to the good and simple life. In my study of history, one common theme that I have often seen in many of the revolutions that have occurred around the world is that things so often get escalated by those who are in power taking too hard a line on some matters. Things can all be going great, maybe the people are putting together a peaceful petition for reform, and suddenly the king snaps and cracks down way harder than necessary. The populace predictably retaliates and things spiral out of control. One classic example of this is Charles Stuart of England, who was so inflexible and uncooperative that he more or less forced his subjects to execute him against their will out of sheer obstinacy. As a parent of small children, I have really begun to see these issues of freedom versus authority come to me. I have seen these issues of freedom versus authority come to me. I have seen that it is a case of does something happen in such and such and such as parents thinkfter? I have seen that it is a sûr that when children share values and go out and argue or argue with other children forometric reasons, they make them teachers of their parents' feelings, teachers of their children's personal morals, their personal values. Missing their parents is an Bürger cause of unrest and areat policy has gotta be imposed upon them.

Or what can I say yes to? Often as parents, we get to a place where we just say no offhand without really considering. There are times when I've told my kids no about something, only to realize upon further reflection that I really probably could have told them yes. This doesn't mean that I'd tell them yes to everything. Setting healthy boundaries for your child is an important part of being a parent. But I do try to make sure that when I say no, I have a good reason for it. One of the hardest things about parenting is learning not to get caught up in power struggles. A lot of times, if you honestly self-evaluate, you'll be able to differentiate between the times when you insist upon something because it's a boundary and it's for your child's own good, and times when you insist upon something because you feel the need to assert your dominance as a parent. Now, don't get me wrong, I do believe that kids should be taught to respect or at least obey their parents, not necessarily as a service to the parent. But I do try to make sure that when I say no, I have a good reason for it. But I also believe that the kind of authority figure I represent to them as a child will influence their relationship with authority down the road. As they look back on their childhood, will they remember a parent who lovingly corrected them and was stern with them when necessary in order to facilitate their safety and development? Or will they remember a parent who was domineering and authoritarian, who took fierce stances on matters for the sake of winning arbitrary power struggles? If I parent in this way, I am not invoking authority for my child's benefit. I am invoking it to protect my own ego and to hide my insecurity as a parent. This is a really difficult thing to navigate as a parent. It takes a lot of time and learning, and I don't pretend that I've got it all figured out. Please remember and understand that I am not a qualified parenting expert, and this all just comes down to my own personal opinion and worldview. I guess the main point I'm trying to get across here is that when we lead people, in whatever capacity it may be, we should try to give them as much opportunity to exercise their personal freedom as possible. When situations necessitate our interference as authority figures, we need to make sure that we are interfering for the right reasons, and that everything is done from a place of love and respect, not pride, insecurity, or authoritarianism. When we lead, the Taoist principle of non-doing is super relevant, because we find that people who are given autonomy within healthy boundaries often learn to lead themselves.

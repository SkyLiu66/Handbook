I saw your question for the comments. Let's wait for the other people. Hello, hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. 来共享一下。 第一个小伙伴是做香包的, 然后他的问题是, 淘宝现在有个工具叫做桃花岛, 然后他跟我讲了这个工具啊, 说这个工具大概意思就是小二会联系他, 让他会有一个充值, 相当于充钱, 然后呢有一个定向粉丝的保底, 然后发布内容可多次触达粉丝带来转化。 这个工具啊, 大家看一下啊, 这是我们可以理解为这是一个相当于让商家去充钱, 然后呢让你去发布内容, 说可以触达粉丝的一个工具, 但你们有没有听下发现这个工具, 其实本质还是说你这个内容怎么样, 你的内容发布对不对, 以及是否能够吸引粉丝, 会决定你在淘宝通过这个钱你带来的销售额, 听不理解? 这个工具我刚去查了一下, 我都没有搜到, 然后我也问了一些我身边的朋友, 都没有人知道这个品, 我觉得这可能是现在天猫或淘宝很新很新的一个品, 这个品可能现在使用的人很少, 非常少, 所以我在想这个工具我听下来是不太可靠的, 你如果说用这个工具, 前提是, 你在小红书或抖音已经跑出了一套内容, 这套内容本身是可以转化的, 那你在天猫可以做这个事情, 不然说实话, 天猫和天猫线就是一个存量市场, 它的流量百分之五十或六十以上都来自小红书或抖音, 你做这个事情有没有意义? 我这么讲你们能理解吧? 所以这个工具啊, 我建议大家就是, 你在小红书和抖音没有整明白钱, 就没必要花钱去做, 你不如说把这个钱冲在小红书聚光去投一些优质笔记, 能不能理解? 理解的互动一下, 理解的互动一下, 我们简单互动一下, 然后第二个小伙伴的问题是说, 他想知道, 呃, 神仙类的一些品的一些关键词表现, 搜索指数啊等等, 这个问题其实聚光里面有, 你们还记得我讲过聚光吗? 我说聚光其实可以看, 可以看到你的这个词, 呃, 整体的一个数据的, 我们上下聚光啊, 带大家再看一遍, 我们正好, 在那个温故而知新啊, 温故而知新, 带大家看一下怎么样用聚光, 好吧? 聚光平台 聚光 聚光 You오宝贝 It's not coming. 登录订录 怎么有张登录啊? so 耶 直桌等一下我用另外一个…… 手机把聚光呢ând habor I can't synchronize with the website because I don't use this phone. It's on my Mac. Wait a second. Okay. And then the account password. I'll synchronize it. Let's see. Let's see. There's a tool here. Can you see my sharing? You can see my sharing, right? Okay. And then look at the keyword planning. I synchronized this tool. I've mentioned this in my class. How do you look at it? You either look at the industry. I don't know if the raw materials industry has it in the food. You can look at it. Or you can look at the dairy products. Because one of my friends' question was if she wanted to look at dairy products. Raw materials, rice wine, and wine. Let me give you an example. Let's look at the dairy products. There's also raw materials. Let's look at the dairy products first. The word dairy products is pretty... The word milk powder is pretty complicated. The word milk powder is pretty complicated. But the word yogurt bowl is actually quite cheap. The word yogurt bowl is cheap. To be honest, this word can be combined with Pamela. And Pamela made the yogurt bowl. But it's not that good. Because it's not over 100. This word is not a big word. It's not a big word. And then let's look at the... You can find the word you're looking for here. And then judge the word. If you go to the search page. You go to the search page. How much is its volume? Second, how much is its price? For example, I make raw meat. The amount of raw meat will be larger. Oh, the word mountain wood is actually a very high word. The word mountain wood must be bought. The word is over 100. So if you are doing offline, it can actually add volume. If you are some of the products of mountain wood, you can make a comparison. For example, mountain wood vs. Comparison. If you have something in the mountain wood, you have something in the mountain wood. I have people. I have people. So mountain wood is actually a high word. And its price is not expensive. Right? So the words, to be honest, are some of the I think everyone will go to For example, learning to cook. This will search for these words. These words, to be honest, it's hard for you to set up some notes. But I think the word mountain wood can still be set up. Or you can directly use words to push words. Or there are some above and below. And then you can see that there is also a smart push word. I'll talk about the smart push words here. For example, I can choose a piece of previous cooperation. Some notes were sent before. For example, this. For example, you see my word is a inner line. And then to judge my note A related keyword. A small red stone How much is the price of the I closed it. I forced it to sell. So you see this intersection is through your notes. And then this side can also Through promotion experience You can push words through products. For example, you choose your store now. For example, you see our note. I worked with a business boy before. I chose this product. This product chain of products. What are the key words related to the chain of products? And how much is his search volume? The higher the search volume, the higher the index. This word means that the demand for the word is higher. The lower the initial price, The lower the flow you can buy. If the initial price is high, That means it's more expensive. And then there's the word push. For example, I'll just play a fresh milk. Okay, let's see which product to play. Let's try a fresh milk. You see, fresh milk. You can see the overall search volume of the keyword below. For example, the word Yumeijin. It's not that big. The word below is actually quite small. Milk. It's not that big. Milk. It's not that big. It's not that big. Look at yogurt. Look at yogurt. It's not that big. It's not that big. It's not that big. Look at yogurt. It's not that big. What's the problem? The user doesn't search for this keyword on purpose. Or the search volume of this keyword is very low. So I'm going to figure out a way. When do I drink yogurt? For example, breakfast, right? You searched for breakfast. To be honest, your amount must be large. This means that when you make this product, You can't set up the keyword. You have to set up your long-term words, So you can use this to judge what kind of words you want to search for See, this word will be much bigger Right? And dinner And for example, sandwiches, food This word will be much bigger Can you understand what I mean? Including for example, you can type in Worker or office workers But this word is not that big So This word is not that big either So for example, milk products This word is still low in the search for work From the category, the group, the scene, etc It's not that high Right? And then back to this So how do I judge the key words of these products? Light is one The second method is that you can use some tools for Chan Xiaohong or cucumber You can search for the bottom of these words Let me show you For example, use Chan Xiaohong I don't recommend you to buy this tool You can use the cucumber Cucumber will be easier to use Because Chan Xiaohong is not going to put the quantity in the product Because this product doesn't make money So Chan Xiaohong is created by Chan's mother Chan's mother is still doing it But Chan Xiaohong has too few buyers So they are now The open power and data are not particularly good And then I was because they gave me the whole line before So I think I sometimes see what the data is still useful It's a supporting function I think I've already tried it I've already downloaded it For example, I search for notes The key words I use to search for notes For example, it's milk According to the amount of interaction You see I've been here for nearly 90 days I look at the notes according to the amount of interaction I think it's better to look at the data Even I think you can look at business notes Because I think business notes are better Explain some of the actions of this brand Some of them are actually some of the users' own You can't judge this brand or this category of some actions But you can observe business notes In fact, the same is true for the thousand-year-old For example, you see Home-made snacks about what I eat at home alone Then you click in to see This is a better way For example, I pour it out I pour it out I can see what the title of these notes is And what is the key word of its title Then you go to judge which key words are hot This is a better tool But I think this is a bit of a coincidence You can actually get this data through this spotlight You probably know how much this word or this content is Then come to the third part Then come to the third part And then come to the third part There is a friend who says There are now 1000 fans in the brand And then whether or not to do a test When do you need to do a test Answer the first question first What do you think the purpose of a test is What is the purpose of doing a test Let's interact What do you think the purpose of doing a test is What is the purpose of doing a test There are two reasons for making a license plate. The first reason is that some brands say that my flagship official account wants to make some brand-name products. Then my segmented group, then my license plate is for one account to establish a brand, like some visual and brand content that is completely brand-like. My other account can be a plant account. For example, some accounts, let me give you a example. I mentioned a brand before. It's called... For example, I search for Randechamber. I remembered last time, I was talking about the main book, right? I had a lesson before, I took the main book and gave an example. I said how to set up the business account notes. For example, the main book. For example, the main book. For example, the main book. Look, there are two main books. This account is for a brand. It will, for example, find who is the sponsor, who is the partner, what online activities, what online world-color, or what new products are online. But look at the other account. The other account is for a plant account. Do you understand what I mean? This is the first case. Why should I set up a business account? This is the first case. I set up different requests for different accounts. One account is to set up a brand. For another account, I set up a plant account. And there are even some notebooks that can be linked to products. Can you understand what I mean? This is the first case. What is the purpose of the second account? The second case is actually to play with more brands. To play with more. Actually, I said that one account is to set up a brand. What is the trend now? There are some brands that are not very popular. The second case is similar to the purpose of my business account. What is the purpose of my business account? My purpose is to enlarge. I want to duplicate. What does that mean? For example, I take one of my accounts. I have good data for the content and the amount of interaction. And I have several content models. My product notes and delivery data are also fine. What am I going to do? I'm going to enlarge. Now I use more accounts to put my number one. These content similar to the style of the style. Then send it. That's equivalent to saying that I have one account. I can sell 5000 yuan a day or sell half a dollar. I have two accounts or three accounts. Can I contribute 20,000 to 30,000 a day? Do you understand what I mean? This is a big advantage of making a proof account. And there is another advantage of making a proof account. What is it? You can reduce the risk of a number that can't run out or the data can't run out. Because frankly speaking, one number. Can a note run out? It is affected by many factors. If you have multiple numbers to send similar notes. In fact, it can increase the probability that a note can run out. So making proof accounts is actually just a few points. I told him that I have a different brand. Yes, expand the channel. Yes, or that is to say, one is a brand, one is a delivery. Or that is to say, I have run out of accounts. Then I use multiple accounts to copy. For example, you see me now. I have my own diana account. I have several accounts to copy now. Why? I will share this account with you. Because I found that I have a limited experience in making an account. And for example, I have to do content, I have to do course delivery, I have to do corporate consulting, etc. I don't have so much time. Then I can take some of the content I am now calling and run it through. Let other friends send it in the form of a picture or in the form of other text. The same can be used to get customers. Just say that I will use my same content or my point of view to send it in a video or other form. Then I will get customers. Then I don't have to completely just limit myself to one account. For me, my experience can do more important things. Making a license is equivalent to expanding. So this is the purpose of making a license. Then let's talk about the second one. That little friend said that I am now going to make a license. Then you have to look at your brand. For example, you have now made 1000 fans. You have to judge how many people you are now. This little friend should be in our live class now. Would it be convenient to chat? I mean, do you want me to talk about it? You send your account and send it to me. We are just now targeting the situation of your account and your business. Let's talk about it. Okay. I think it's a good opportunity to talk about it. Little red book search Okay. Sobo AB Okay. Sobo I think you made a very nice picture. Wow, it's very exquisite. You look like a brand now. It's a good example of the trend of your brand. It's to expose your brand products. Because I guess I'll take a look at it with my phone first. Because the computer can't see your double-channel connection. What is your current price? If your main account insists on doing this thing, you must be a proof of the account. Otherwise, you can't sell the goods. Users see the pictures that are good. It must be a scene picture. It could be a model or a blogger's portrait. Do you understand what I mean? It's hard for you to produce sales directly. So you must be a proof of the account. Your clothes are very nice. I think it's very nice. And now you don't have a commercial chain. If you want to produce a proof of the account, you must go to a broker or a blogger to cooperate. Then, you can transfer some of his notes to your company's second store. Then, you can put it on the commercial chain. Some of them are worn. Some of them may not be worn. I just brushed a piece that was not worn. It's very nice. I think it's very nice. The design is also very good. I also planted some white clothes. It's very nice. I think your design is very thoughtful. The design is very thoughtful. I'm the only one in the group at the moment. From their point of view, I think if you do this thing alone, you will be very tired. You will be very tired. Lu Hong, at least now, someone is helping you to post content. What I mean is that for brand founders, you have to have a framework for how to do this thing. What things to do and what to prepare for each thing. This is very important. Then, you go to find the right person to help you distribute your time. If you have to do everything yourself, you are busy. You are busy and can't open the door. And you can't focus on making more important decisions. You have to make a decision. Then, you can share some of the relevant things. But before you share the things, you must have a very detailed thinking guide for doing this thing. Or a framework for SOP content and what to do. What is the framework? What is the operation framework? In that framework, it may include some of your product notes, some brand notes. Then, for example, you may find some people to distribute. You may even go to the answer room. You may even go to the call center. It's like you are doing a thinking guide like me. You have to figure it out first. Then, you have to understand what this person is going to do. Because now, including me, if I say I'm going to hire someone to come in, I tell him to do a new media, or to use this account, he will definitely not be able to get it. So, I have to do some very detailed SOP. Very detailed SOP. Then, I tell them how to do it. This is very important. So, the other day, I heard a very good comment. It said, how far can a company go? It's about how detailed the framework is in the boss's mind. It's about how detailed the business thinking guide is for this company. And how clear it is. This is very important. Then, back to the second question. How to distinguish the official number, the aesthetic style, the number of customers, and the number of customers? How to distinguish this? It depends on what you want at this stage. I think, any company, any brand, your first stage must be to survive. If you want to survive, it must be that you have to have more content in your SOP. Because you have to bring goods first, you have to have a new line of business, you have to earn money to support your own team. Then, you have to consider the brand style. Because a good blogger or a good person to go up and wear your clothes, or to do some content in the SOP, good content can also reflect your brand style. Do you understand what I mean? A good blogger can also reflect the brand style. So, I think that's the first thing. Then, I will talk about this. I just recorded a class today. I just recorded a class, but I haven't sent it to the group yet. I just recorded a class. I will share it with you in advance. What I am talking about is how to match the answer. In Xiaohong, Shuhai, and Douyin, there are four types of answers. One is called distribution. One is called the answer is more creative. The third type is it has creative ability and also has the ability to bring goods. The fourth type is the live broadcast ability is stronger. What is distribution? Just like what I said before, the first one is called distribution. The second type is called the answer is more creative. The third type is called the answer is stronger. What is the verde? Just like what I said before, the EHT is like some brands that areous to play content, but Xiaohong is normal, all the週 ran am Cassenter Pandas were a part of it. For this, they use What Closet to hide the contents of the episode. Are you understand me? It is something like to introduce and promote one's body. Because he only uses his accounts only to make his story, he only uses his study and then might feel the seemed as a Sharon ambassador in the ad. If the pay itself is a category, the name of the encuentต� or the job search is a bit long. for in fact e woods, right? 这个比较卷的一个赛道 如果说一个个户品牌 他只用企业号去发 就算他内容能力很强 用户在推荐下 刷到一个他的笔记 他在搜索 在搜这个品牌相关的笔记的时候 他发现怎么都是企业号笔记 他是不是可能 整个重仓和下场转换 就会有影响了 懂我意思吧 这是为什么要去 找这么多大人发的原因 那创作能力比较强的 就比如像iMac 现在我觉得你现在 就要去找一些 内容能力比较强的 或者就是他本身 就有一架子的一些模特 或素人去穿你衣服上身 就你跟他合作的目的是 他上身就感觉很好 然后你要做的事情 是把他这个笔记 去转载和放大 然后可以加商品链接 这个是比较重要的 那第三种就是 他既有创作能力 又有带货能力 比如说像什么 抖音的会比较多 小红书其实是没有的 小红书是没有的 小红书头部几个大人 像除了那个顶流 什么张小慧 张小慧 董杰 易能进啥的 其他的说实话 几个大人 他们的内容创作能力 都很一般 甚至我之前有一个课 我也讲了 在小红书 你不需要找 十万粉丝以上的大人 你找了其实 你就是浪费钱 小红书本身 他的流量池 是给到北部大人 更多流量的 所以像这种创作能力 比较强 比较有带货能力的 在抖音会比较多 抖音的比如说像潘雨润 什么张牧凡 张凯一 这种是你们都知道的 其他就是每个类目 有一些top的一些 就是他的画面表现 他镜头语言 就讲得特别好的 就是你看这视频 就是停不下来 你会看到你那种 表现力特别强的 抖音的大人还挺多的 那些大人 那些大人呢 说实话 就是他的短视频 是直接能带货的 并且暂留的 都能够阿歪跑得很好 那你这个时候 其实就要去衡量 你跟他 合作到底是否值得 那值得是否值得 就要看你的品能 是否跟他匹配嘛 这个我在课里面会有讲 我就不我就不在这边 具体展开讲了 然后第三个就是 直播能力比较强嘛 直播能力比较强 直播能力比较强呢 就是相当于 就是要去做直播 这个课里面也会讲 我就不展开讲了 就不展开讲了 因为今天还有 其他东西要讲 然后刚才小伙伴 有讲个问题说 服装行业我发现 有带货能力 且内容能力比较强 都不便宜 我觉得其实我看到 有一些几千粉丝 或几百粉丝 上升感觉好的还是有的 上升感觉好还是有的 像那个入红讲的说 内容能力比较强的 并且带货的 就好比你们之前合作 那个达人叫啥来着 我忘记了 他本身就已经 有一定影响力了 他不是只是图片能力强 他文字能力也还不错 并且呢 他有一群本身 就很信任他的粉丝 会跟着他买买买的 所以直播间的带货数据 也还不错 这种本身就是已经 是比较优质的达人了 但你这种达人说实话 因为你不可放量 或者说你能够找到的并不多 所以对于你来讲 你可控的还是去找一些 就是那种小的QC 他本身他的体型 他整个人的状态 以及他的长相 跟你这个品还挺契合的 以及他日常 他去的地方 拍照的地方 就是偏比如说是比较日系的 或比较韩系的 或者说就是比较那种 中国文化的那种感觉 你去看是否匹配 然后再讲下一个问题 再讲下一个问题 下一个问题呢 就是 有小伙伴问了 说之前 我讲的关于EHD 这个牌子我去要了 这个牌子的这个 但是我要到他们公司另外一个品牌 我发一下到群里 我发一下到群里 发一下到群里 稍等一下 我发一下 你们看一下 你们看一下 他的这个brief写的也非常细了 这是EHD他们好像孵化的一个新的品牌 我来共享一下 能看到吧 叫 怎么读啊 NEBE NEBEMA NEBE 你看他写的非常细啊 报备笔记里面注意的事项啥的 啊 必提关键词痛点 内容要求 你看标题方向啥的都给你写明白了 手图怎么做 这明白了 啊 配图怎么做 这明白了 啊 评论区引导都有了 是吧 然后你看他会写了素材免费授权 品牌用于转载和小红书和天猫等等 去大家按照这个去写brief啊 再看另外一个 哦 知道了 嗯 前面的类似就说了 啊 你看他图片怎么样 每张图片之间的连贯性都是有的 跟我之前课程里面讲的一样对吧 所以啊 笔记其实你三张图片四张图片 他也是有一个玩波率的 也是有个玩波率的 你怎么样吸引用户 堵下去 啊 能够把你的笔记的图片看完 这个很重要的 日不是日画里写的戏是这个品牌 因为他做的很细 这个品牌就是我讲的 他用这是第一种相当于 他就是品牌自己已经很懂这个内容怎么去拍了 他只是说通过达人人再去获得多一些素材 啊 所以他是在小红书能够拿到很好成绩的一个品牌 你看他评论是怎么写的 哪些话都给你整明白了 非常塞啊 大家可以参考一下 说实话这几个brief 你要是写的他那么细 你在小红书啊 外肯定做的二以上的二起步的 然后嗯 第一个问题解决了 第二个问题就是说想要做一个新品吗 类似EHD这样的 起号阶段 起号阶段 有没有这个咋说呢 你要根据你们这个品类 你这个问题有点太大了 嗯 你要先关注你现在在做的这个事情 你的目的是什么 你现在起号的目的是什么 你是要去带货还是拿互动量还是说涨粉 比如说我就是为了带货 那我要知道我这个号 其实为了发所有笔记 就是为了带动我的商品笔记 那我要去判断哪几个笔记 它是能够拉动销售的 让用户除了说点进来以外 只能够产生种草和下单的这个路径呢 那这个是比较关键的 啊 所以我就还是讲了 就是你要知道你起这个号 你的目的是啥 你要跟老板去明确 你交付的这个目标是什么 你要是这目标没有定下来 说实话说什么 呃 魏龙啊 还是什么 EHD 它是两种完全不一样的打法 你要跟老板先明确 你们要交付的是什么 然后再去考虑怎么去做 好吧 理解我的意思吧 是否理解 呃 可以互动一下 可以互动一下 然后陆鸿说我在想 呃 服装穿搭类 其实是一种 怎么进入这个思路 穿搭类的这种 其实还审美很主观的 嗯 我觉得这个事情是这样的 嗯 一个款式卖的好 其实还是有一些 可复制的场景的 就可能说你这个审美 我觉得最多不会多 超过时装 比如说有一双鞋子 比如打个比方 像那个耐克 或者说什么阿基达斯 他早期跟比如说跟什么 凯特 跟什么凯特 产业合作 还有联名款 你会发现大家怎么样去拍 那几张图片 虽然说很多人去拍 大家其实都是用 同样的模板去拍的 这个模板的数量 不会超过十个的 所以还是有些共性的 所以视觉这个东西 还是说你主流的审美 是哪一种 然后大家会跟随 不可能完全不一样的审美 比如说你看巴黎世家的人 穿巴黎世家的衣服 或背巴黎世家的包的人 其实 其实是一种 审美都差不多 因为这是品牌的调性 品牌的风格决定了 到底是哪一集中达人 那甚至你在找达人的时候 或者说达人的拍摄内容的时候 其实这达人本身 他的风格可能就跟你们 这个品已经很接近了 所以他的拍出来的这种感觉 不会差别特别大的 我这么讲你能理解吧 所以我觉得这个主观本身 已经是在一个大的基本盘下面 可能有些少的变量 如果说就是偏见上 像我说像EHD 那你就要去找你们这个品的 包环内容结构呀 比如说像EHD 它这个brief 其实我回到它这个brief啊 它这个brief说实话 它已经给你整明白了 它这一套图片是怎么样的 它已经知道这一套图片 就是能够吸引用户点进去的 并且能够让用户 反正下单的啊 比如说封面是怎么样的 图啊是怎么样的 图三是怎么样的 然后像这个牌子啊 像EHD这个牌子 你会发现它的图片 其实是偏种草型的 啥意思呢 就是 它的笔记都是 往付费流的 往付费流的 它很难去撬动赞留 因为广告痕迹是比较重的 广告痕迹是比较重的 好吧 你们留的一些问题的打一 我都讲完了 然后大家看下 有没有什么其他问题 大家可以在聊天框里面打一下 然后或者说 可以一起连麦聊一下 一起连麦聊一下 还有其他问题吧 还有问题吗 没问题的话就结束了哦 大家如果说有其他什么问题 可以在群里问我 大家如果说有其他什么问题 没有人问的问题 所以做内容的小伙伴 是不是要具备同样内容在 同样的内容 看一下 所以做内容小伙伴 是不是要具备同样内容 在不一样的账号的复制和输出 就是 内容的风格是类似的 内容的风格是类似的 而且你们想啊 就坦白讲一个瓶 或者说一个衣服包 它肯定是就是 一个衣服包 或者说一个核心的场景 或者一个类似的风格 不断的出现在用户面前 然后大家感觉这个很潮 以及有很多明星 或很多头部大人都在穿 就相当于拥有了 就很多人想拥有同款 所以就是不一定是完全是复制 是用类似的风格 做好的不是 怎么样找到合适的 做内容合作的人 做好的不是 这个问题 你的意思就相当于怎么去招到合适的 帮你团队做内容的人 这个说实话你真的要自己去找 这个东西还是要自己去找 对我前期我觉得还是要招兼职 对你来讲会比较划算 招兼职会比较划算 你可以有几种方式吧 如果说你现在已经知道 这个瓶怎么去打了 内容的结构是怎么样的 对你来讲就招一个人 代替你的劳动 或代替你的时间 如果说你还在摸索期 以及你觉得有一些不确定性 你最好招一些 就相当于他之前做过内容的人 他大概知道这个瓶 做的怎么样 然后呢你招他进来 相当于你把你的数告诉他 你们俩去摸 但是你要把握大方向 这是你来参加我这个课的原因 然后呢当他跟你合作已经 比如说拿到了一些销量技术 比如说做到跑了一千件了 两千件了甚至五千或一万件了 你到时候可以考虑说 你要不要招一个全职的人 好吧 内裤在小红书是不是属于比较难做的 内裤这个品 我看一下我搜一下 我搜一下 我搜一下 我搜一下 我觉得内裤其实可以去 去打这个什么抗军啊 去打就是怎么样 就是我觉得就是 嗯 稍等一下 可以打女性健康这块 我觉得这是可能跟内裤比较能去结合的 那具体要看你们这个内裤的 我觉得要去看你 因为我这边马上要结束了 我先停止共享 我再开个新的 你有没有打过 witnessing 这种印象 我的是 eben 就是这个 这个 那这是一个소리 就是什么 这玩意 在这个 它的 是这个 有 differentlyˇ 在而 是不是",

Here's the graveyard book. I haven't talked about it before, so I just grabbed it and we begin with there was a hand in the darkness and it held a knife. The knife had a handle of polished black bone and a blade finer and sharper than any razor. If it sliced you, you might not even know you'd been cut, not immediately. The knife had done almost everything it was brought to that house to do, and both the blade and the handle were wet. And we know very, very quickly, we understand that the knife had been cut, and the blade had been polished black bone. And we know very, very quickly, we understand that the knife had been cut, and the blade had been polished black bone. We know very, very quickly, we understand that the knife had been cut, and the blade had been polished black bone. We know very, very quickly, we understand that the knife had been cut, and the blade had been polished black bone. Dealing with a man called the Man Jack, who is walking around this house with a knife. The hunt was almost over. He'd left the woman in her bed, the man on the bedroom floor, the older child in her brightly colored bedroom surrounded by toys and half-finished models that only left the little one, a baby, barely a toddler, to take care of. One more, and his task would be done. And the man, who was walking around this house with a knife, was walking around this house with a knife. And the man, who was walking around this house with a knife, was walking around this house with a knife. And the man, who was walking around this house with a knife, was walking around this house with a knife. Now we know exactly what the Man Jack has done. He's killed a family. And what he wants, which is to kill the baby. The problem is, the baby isn't going to be there. Because when we meet the baby, what the baby wants is to get out of his crib. Ever since the child had learned to walk, he'd been his mother and father's despair and delight. For there never was such a boy for wandering, for climbing up things, for getting into and out of things. That night he'd been woken by the sound of something on the floor beneath him falling with a crash. Awake, he soon became bored and had begun looking for a way out of his crib. It had high sides like the walls of his playpen downstairs. But he was convinced that he could scale it. All he needed was a step, and the baby gets out of the crib. The baby wants to get out. The baby is not trying to escape. The baby's just heads off, bumping down the stairs on his bottom. Heads out of the open door that the Man Jack had left open when he crept into the house. The baby heads up the hill. And then we meet some other characters. In the graveyard. Owens, called the Pale Woman in a voice that might have been the rustling, rustling rustle of the wind through the long grass. Owens, come and look at this. She crouched down and peered at something on the ground as a patch of shadow moved into the moonlight, revealing itself to be a grizzled man in his mid-forties. He looked down at his wife and then looked at what she was looking at. And he scratched his head. Mistress Owens, he said, for he came from a more formal age than our own. Is that what I think it is? And at that moment, the thing he was inspecting seemed to catch sight of Mrs. Owens. For it opened. It's mouth letting the rubber nipple it was sucking fall to the ground. And it reached out a small chubby fist as if it were trying for all the world to hold on to Mrs. Owens' pale finger. Strike me silly, said Mr. Owens, if that isn't a baby. Of course it's a baby, said his wife. And the question is, what is to be done with it? I dare say that is a question, Mistress Owens, said her husband. And yet it is not our question. For this here baby is unquestionably alive. And I don't know what to do with it. And as such is nothing to do with us and is no part of our world. Look at him smile, said Mrs. Owens. And now we have two ghosts in a graveyard and a baby. And we know that one of them wants to get involved and one of them doesn't. And then the man, Jack, turns up. And the Owens' family hesitate. They're about to leave the baby when they see a ghost, which is pretty unusual. I mean, it's not that unusual given that they are, in fact, ghosts and live in a graveyard amongst ghosts. But there was a difference between the folk of the graveyard and this. A raw, flickering, startling shape. The gray color of television static. All panic and naked emotion which flooded the Owens' as if it were their own. Three figures. Two large, one smaller. But only one of them was in focus, was more than an outline or a shimmer. And the figure said, my baby. He is trying to harm my baby. A clattering. The man outside was hauling a heavy metal garbage can across the alley to the high brick wall that ran around that part of the graveyard. Protect my son, said the ghost. And Mrs. Owens thought it was a woman, of course. The babe's mother. So now. Again. So what do people want? Well, his dead mother wants her son to be protected. Mrs. Owens wants to protect. The man Jack wants to kill. The baby is perfectly happy right now. We also know that the baby needs to be looked after, even if it doesn't know that it wants to be looked after. And now we get to follow what happens. We get to follow as a misguided. A mysterious stranger named Silas appears and deals with the stranger. Seems to wipe his mind of what's happened in the graveyard and sends him off again. And we follow. Mistress Owens and the baby. As there is a convocation of the dead, all of the dead in the graveyard get together. And debate what should be done with the baby. We know. What Mistress Owens wants. She wants the baby. We know what the people in the graveyard want. They want. Not to have to deal with a live baby. You're a. You're in a graveyard. Why would you want that? And then two things happen. One of which is death. Herself appears. A lady on the gray riding her pale horse. Arrives and she just says to them, the dead should have charity. And the other. Is that Silas. The mysterious stranger who. Appears to be neither living nor dead. Says that he will be the child's guardian. He will bring it food from the world of the living. And he will help look after it. And at this. We end the first chapter. Of the graveyard book. And it's all being driven by wants. It's all being driven by needs. A child has been adopted. By the inhabitants of a graveyard. And now what we want to know is okay. What's going to happen? Who is this child? What's he going to be when he grows up? And now we have our beginning, but everything is driven. By want. Everything is driven by need. And everything is driven by characters wanting different things. And those different things. Colliding. And every moment. That one character wants something. And another one character wants something mutually exclusive. And they collide. Every time that happens. You have a story.",

    "data": " Bronzer and blush are great products. They're my favorites. I want to show you how to select and apply them properly for the days when you're just not feeling your best. So, bronzer 101. What I want to tell you about bronzer, the reason I love bronzer so much is because it's everything. You could use it to look healthier, give yourself a healthy glow. You use it to even out your skin. You could use it on a neck that's a little whiter than the rest of your body. But I love bronzer because it's a little bit more of a blush. It's a little bit I think of it as a tint to the skin. As a makeup artist, I'm in control of whoever I make up, and if they're not looking right, I usually grab the bronzer. Bronzer also works amazing for anyone's regular day-to-day makeup, even without foundation, is great. What you don't want in bronzer is to contour with it because you don't need to contour. What you don't want in bronzer is to change the color of your face. You're enhancing and you're adding a tint. Use a wide brush. I like to use little rounded, a wide brush. And the way I choose the color is I pull it up to the face and I could see right away that I need a little bit on her neck. So I'm going to use one that is going to just warm up Molly's neck. So it will literally blend everything together. Because everybody is lighter under the sun. So I'm going to use a little bit of the bronzer to add a little bit of color to their neck. And this one is a little bit of the browner color I'm using. And by the way, when you use any kind of powdered shadows or bronzers, you dip the brush in, you tap it, you blow to get it off, and that way you don't make a mess on the skin. And also look at what bronzers you're using. A ton of powder is not coming out. So I like to use bronzers that are a little bit more powdery. And I like to use a little bit of powder to get rid of the spray. I lower the wash down at my nose because I didn't want to cost too much. I love feeling myases outta the eyes. I am using bron heh. And I will position them on to move them. And I'm going to do it now where they have smaller – they are still very small than every hospital I go to. And just apply lightfolgitate using a brush. The stickku is a little bit thicker than other brushes, so you really want to be dansy and внully. And I don't use everything. And it's very important to have a base primer by strain or incremindir one other visit on this day. I used one, and I just get done with it. So now, you then use the color. Who's doing this? So this one would be better if you are using it morning after morning or evening. cheek and the trick is you apply it up but you also go down so the majority of the bronzer i'm using a heavier hand when i go right on molly's cheeks that's the heaviest press and then i'm lightening up how hard i'm pressing and i just gently put it over and what i'm doing is i'm blending it in so it's just almost like i'm giving her a retouching which we all like and what i also love about this is you could still see molly's freckles we're not covering them up we're embracing them i love freckles i know some makeup artists draw them in cute for a picture not for real life but molly's freckles are great but then i can also use more than one color you know makeup artists should have a few different tones for women of color you want deeper shades sometimes you might need red sometimes you might need a little bit of yellow undertone so i'm going to use a little bit of yellow undertone and then i'm going to go in and for fair women like the women that wear like an alabaster shade or like the palest color foundation a touch of pinky if you're that fair never wear a bronzer that's yellow or bronze because it's just going to look dirty also choose a bronzer that isn't shimmery a shimmery bronzer which i have here is really nice just as a little bit of highlight to the skin but it's not you're all over you never want to put on a lot of bronzer and then you're going to go in and you're going to put some shimmer all over your face that really just adds a little bit of a highlight and also when choosing a shimmery bronzer make sure that you're not going too white that it just kind of is a little bit of an enhancement and really just goes up high into the cheekbone to give a little bit of a shimmer you don't really have to blend it if you're choosing the right color now that is such an important detail and it's a little bit of a highlight to the face but it's also a little bit of a highlight to the face because if you have to blend it it's the wrong color or you put too much on the trick is to just put what you want it's only going on the highlight of the cheek i'm not using it on the forehead nose and chin i know a lot of makeup artists do and i know a lot of makeup artists put a shimmery highlight here personally i don't know why but makeup artists do do it they do it a little bit on the nose but i'm someone that really just likes it on the high of the cheek. So again, a bronzer that's flat or matte and a bronzer that's shimmery, they're for two different things. And also make sure if you're a makeup artist, you have a range of colors. And if you're just a woman at home watching, two colors is really all you need. Kind of one that works on the neck and one that maybe is a little bit pinker if you need to kind of add a little bit of, you know, awakeness to your makeup. And your brush should be wide. And the difference between a wide brush for bronzer and a blush brush, I will show you. So here's the difference between a bronzer brush and a blush brush. The bronzer brush is way too wide to be able to use on anyone's face because it would just be too much of blush. There are different formulas of bronzers. You can get a liquid formula bronzer that literally is a gel. A lot of men use that. And you could mix it with moisturizer. You could apply it. Just make sure you wash your hands because it stains. You can also use a creamy bronzer. Now this one is kind of a sheer but beautiful tone. And this will give you the glow. Where the highlighter was basically shimmer, this is just pure on. And it's a really nice, crazy, crazy glow. And you could use this on days when you're not wearing any makeup. It just adds this really nice, natural, I've just been to Saint Tropez look. And again, you apply it up into the hairline. I'm definitely blending it down. I'm looking at the top of it. And I love this because it's not powder. So it just gives a really nice dewiness. And I often wear this when I have no other makeup on, just this. And I always feel so much better. So that's bronzer. And blush, I mean, honestly, she doesn't really need it. But I just want to show you how to really apply blush, especially on top of bronzer. It's really up to you if you want to use a powder or you want to use a cream blush. I like using cream blush with my fingers on dry skin. And powder blush, you do need to use. I like to have a little bit of a brush. And I'm choosing to use the cream right now because we just put cream on Molly's skin. And a really important thing, if you put powder blush on top of a creamy formula, it's not going to be easy to blend. So if you start with a cream, stick to a cream. And same thing with powder. I'm going to add just the teeniest bit of a pinky blush. And I just want to show you the different look. Just a little bit of pink. And everything I have put on her today is definitely not necessarily for every day. But it's just good to know what formulas work and how you use them. The best way to pick your blush color, it's so simple. Is if you pinch your cheek and see the natural color it turns. Or when you exercise, it's the color that your cheeks turn. That is the easiest way to pick a blush. But that's not the only thing that works. It also works if you feel like wearing a little bit of a peachy blush. If you're wearing a peach lipstick. Sometimes that's really nice. Again, it's a lot of blush. I happen to like it. It's probably too much for some people. But you can still see Molly's freckles. There was a lot of blush. So you could use your fingers. But if you're a makeup artist like me, your fingers probably have a lot of things on there already. And so you can either wipe your hands and start all over. And literally just, I mean you're not wiping it off, you're blending it in. Or you use a clean sponge. Pat it. And just make sure that it looks natural. Another great thing you could do with cream blush, which is one of the reasons I like it so much. You could take the blush and just the teeniest bit, whatever's left on your finger, just apply it to your lip. And guess what? You're ready to walk out the door in two seconds. So when it comes to blush, my blush don't is don't overdo blush. Another really good thing about blush is that it's a little bit more natural. And I think that's the beauty of it. The really important blush don't is don't be afraid of it. If you are someone that doesn't love blush, there are very soft colors that are almost there. There are also different formulas that you could try if you're not sure. My blush don't is for sure getting rid of the small brush that comes with many of the compacts. They're usually, you know, those skinny narrow ones. They don't work. I can't even get them to work. Get rid of those. And make sure that you apply the blush to the apple of the cheek. Smile. Find the apple of the cheek. That's the best application. Some of my do's besides apple of the cheek is do find a blush that just makes you look pretty. So when looking at Molly's face, I think she looks stunning. She looked beautiful when she came in. And when I look at her now, she doesn't have any eye makeup on. She really doesn't have, you know, much on her lips. And her skin looks amazing. There is a scar on her forehead and I did not even choose to spend time covering it because number one, I don't notice it. When someone has a scar, it's part of them. And if you are going to put makeup on it, then it's going to just look like makeup. I kind of just use it as part of the skin. And it's character. I like it. She's got freckles and she's got a scar. But guess what? When I look at Molly, I don't notice her scar. I noticed her freckles. I noticed her eyes. And when this girl smiles, she's honestly infectious. Looking at Molly now, she can go anywhere. But what I love about the concealer, the foundation, the bronzer, the blush and the highlighter, it looks like it's part of her. It's her makeup. And to me, that's what I call nude makeup. Nude makeup are colors that are right for your skin. Right for everybody. Just a little bit. I'm using a powder bronzer, and I could see right away that this color is the right color that's going to turn this into one tone. Since it's a darker color, the trick is I'm only using it very, very light because it's easier to add more than it is to blend it in. Blend it all together. Okay. And then whatever's left on the brush, I'm going to use a little bit just to really make her look sun-kissed and a bit of blush to her cheek. I love pink blush. Pink blush makes everyone look pretty. There's a lighter one, there's a duller one, and there's a deeper one. I am going with the deeper one because Anna's skin is darker. And I have to be honest, I grabbed a brush. It's not a blush brush, but it's kind of working. When you are doing blush or bronzer and it's powder or eyeshadow, blow, tap, get the excess off, especially if it's a formula you don't know. Okay. Smile. How you know that the foundation, concealer, bronzer, and blush works, she doesn't need anything else. She has no lipstick on. She has no eyebrows. She has no eyes on. And she looks absolutely gorgeous. And that's how you know that the colors you've chosen at this point are right. And honestly, it's like everything. If you have the right basics, the right concealer, the right foundation, the right everything, it's like having the right bra under your dress. You can't go with something that's not right. And this is a perfect start. One of the things that really drew me to Anna, because I think she's so beautiful and I know she's going to smile again because she can't even believe I keep telling her this, was how naturally beautiful she looks. Like I love, love, and fell in love with the white in her hair. For her, not for me. But she looks so great. And I love it. And I love when she smiles. You see the little lines. Now, you know what? We have lines. Some of us don't because you've chosen to get rid of them. I have chosen to leave mine. She's chosen to leave hers. And that's okay. Whatever works for you. But you have to embrace yourself. You have to embrace your age. And you just have to make yourself look and feel better. And it's a job. And it really requires knowledge. And it requires a little bit of confidence. And definitely a sense of humor. But I love these colors because her skin is really dark. And I wanted to just even out her skin, give her a healthy glow. But I wanted to make sure that when I chose the blush and I knew I wanted pinks, it was basically three or four pinks. But these were the two that I was looking at. And I went with the deeper one because the deeper one, it will create just, it won't be too bright on her skin. It'll just look like a bright color on someone who has lighter skin. But I just love the natural colors that bring out the color in her eyes. She actually looks to me like she's wearing eyeshadow. And so when I will choose her eyeshadow colors, I will look for the natural color that's there already. Same thing in her lips. She's got a little bit of lip balm on and that's it. We haven't done her brows yet. And everything else looks so natural. But the pink colors, I think, really brought everything out and gave her a pop. I'm going to show you what a little bit of bronzer does to both make sure the neck and the face is the same color. Because when you're a makeup artist that works on sets or does weddings, what happens is when a flash goes off, if you've got makeup, foundation, makeup, moisturizer on your face, it's going to go right bright on your face, but different on your body. So you want to use bronzer. So when the flash goes off, it's the same color. And for you makeup artists out there who are learning how to do makeup for studio, even though I'm someone that believes you should wear sunscreen every day of your life, for studio work, don't use a foundation or a moisturizer with sunscreen because it's just going to create like an ashy on anyone's skin and make it look a little bit white. So for bronzer, there's so many different colors. But what I see is we need one color. I need one color to warm it down here and then one a little bit on the face. And I chose a bronzer that has a little bit of warmth in it. Again, so it blends together the colors in her face on her neck. And I'm going to use a little bit of this. And there's nothing prettier than skin that has a beautiful glow. And that comes from moisturizer. And then I'm using it on the skin. So this becomes all one color. So when you are done with the makeup and the makeup settles, then you still have to look at it and see what needs to be covered. So right now I'm looking really at the overall effect. But then I'm going to look and see if the spots could actually be covered a little bit more. Now I learned makeup when there were not retouchers around, digital. You know, photography. I learned where you actually had to get everything done perfectly. If an eyelash was stuck together, you had to see it. So that's why I make sure that things are as perfect as possible. And if you're a makeup artist that does location shoots, instead of lugging your entire kit when you leave a studio or a hotel room to go out, instead of lugging your entire kit when you leave a studio or a hotel room to go out, Instead of lugging your entire kit when you leave a studio or a hotel room to go out, sometimes just having something small around is way easier than lugging your whole kit everywhere you go. sometimes just having something small around is way easier than lugging your whole kit everywhere you go. And a little powder on top of what you just did will lock it in place. So just always look. When you're a makeup artist, you just have to watch. And you have to make sure that everything is exactly the way it should be. And you have to make sure that everything is exactly the way it should be. So bronzer is a great way to just even out the skin. Make sure everything is one color, but then choosing blush for women with dark skin or black skin, you have to pick the right color. It goes wrong if the color is too pastel because then it makes the skin look ashy. You have to pick the right color, because then it makes the skin look ashy. There are choices for blush. skin might want to go with a deeper color. You also can go like up here on top. If you have, you know, her skin is in the middle, so we can actually go brighter, which could be really pretty. I like to choose a blush that has a little bit of brightness and just not use a lot of it. Again, choosing blushes that are pressed hard, bronzers that are pressed hard are way easier. So see how pretty that looks? Now the rule of thumb is to go with a lighter color. I'm going to go with a lighter color. The rule that your blush should look like your cheeks when you pinch it doesn't work with everybody. If your skin is dark, you might not see the right color blush, but you really can't go wrong with a bit of a brighter color, especially how it's blended in. So you go on the apple of the cheek, smile. If you don't know where your apple is, it is right here. Go up into the hairline, take your brush down, and I just gently, without putting too much on, as I did with bronzer, put a little bit all over. Her skin is a little oily, but that doesn't mean you can't put a little bit of highlight on top. And I do this at the end when the skin is oily. I'm just going to add a little bit of a glow. I'm adding a little bit of a shimmery oil because even though her skin is oily, I may be seeing way too much of it. I made sure that there wasn't a lot of oil. I'm using the shimmery oil just to give a highlight on the cheek, which I really love. Also on the chest, on the arms. And basically what happens when you use the oil with the little shimmery glittery particles, it's just a sheen. And when the light hits it, it just is really, really pretty. This is great for photography. It's great for weddings. It's great when you're I'm not someone that would suggest putting makeup on your legs but a shimmery oil is really beautiful on your arms just keep it away from the clothes because it's hard to get off look how good Andrea looks you",

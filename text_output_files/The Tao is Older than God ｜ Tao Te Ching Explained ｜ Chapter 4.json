Today we're going to get into chapter 4 of the Tao Te Ching, but before we do that, I do just want to quickly announce that there is now an official discord for the channel. I'm in there pretty much every day at this point and we're having daily discussions on each chapter of the Tao Te Ching as we cover it in these videos, as well as other topics. So if that sounds like something you'd enjoy, I'll put the link in the description and you can check it out. Now with that said, let's get into the chapter. The Tao is an empty vessel. It is used but never filled. Oh, unfathomable source of ten thousand things. Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knot, soften the glare, merge with dust. Oh hidden deep but ever present. I do not know from whence it comes. It is the forefather of the gods. So this phrase, the ten thousand things, is one that's often used throughout the Tao Te Ching, and it has a few different meanings depending on who you ask. Usually the ten thousand things are held to represent all the things in the world or in reality or the material diversity of the universe. The ten thousand things are also sometimes held to represent all the little distractions that clutter our minds and our lives. Either way, this chapter is basically speaking about the transcendency of the Tao. We are told that the Tao will outlast all things, the sharpest edge, the tightest knot, even the brightest light. Before all of these things was the Tao and after they cease, the Tao will continue to exist, even as all the things in the world expire and go back to the dust they were made from. The chapter says that the Tao is hidden from our sight but exists wherever and whenever anything is, and has done so as long as anyone on earth can comprehend, even longer than the concept of God. Now, if you are religious, this phrase might bother you a bit, but consider this. Whatever god or gods you might believe in, these gods, omniscient or powerful though they might be, still operate under certain laws. There are some laws or forces that even the gods cannot defy. An example from Greek mythology comes in the form of the Myrre, the three sisters of fate, who spin the fortunes of gods and humans alike. One can also look to the story of Phaethon, in which the god Helios promised Phaethon any favor he asked for, and could not revoke his promise, even when the mortal foolishly asked to drive his chariot across the sky to bring in the sun, which led to terrible destruction both in heaven and on earth. Even in modern Christianity, Christ had to be sent as an intermediary for people because God was not able to defy the laws of justice by simply letting them off when they chose sin. The Tao Te Ching sets up the Tao as part of this universal law. Part of the framework upon which all known reality is built. In my opinion, this means a religious person need not shy away from the teachings of the Tao at all, as they are not mutually exclusive. If you guys have any thoughts about this, feel free to leave them in the comments. And with that, I'll see you guys again tomorrow for chapter 5. Peace and blessings.",

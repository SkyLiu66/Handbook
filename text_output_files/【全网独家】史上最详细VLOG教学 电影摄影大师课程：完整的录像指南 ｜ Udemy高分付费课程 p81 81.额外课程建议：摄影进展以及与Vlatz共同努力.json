How do you want to, where do you want to take that? Yeah, I'm always checking on all platforms. I'm following the video creators that I like and I try to take all the tricks because there are no tricks, it's just habits. And for example, there's one dude on Instagram, he used to do the sickest stories with handheld transitions and he put the transitions and then he explained every day how he did it and it's no crazy stuff. Crazy editing. It was just his cell phone and he was doing the transitions like handheld and pretty much came down to the ability to do everything on set, not so much focused on the editing like post crazy CGI stuff. No, it was pretty much just thinking ahead of what you're going to shoot and something so simple. And I was like, wow, I'm going to make an Instagram story, but making it the best. And I was like, wow. For Instagram stories, which are like, you don't see them after 24 hours. So the amount of work that you're putting is not going to be able to perpetuate after 24 hours. That's huge. I mean, if somebody's working so hard, I was like, okay, okay, okay. I like that way of thinking. What if I put the same amount of effort into this? Like in every piece of content I make, it doesn't matter if it's editing, but what if it's a 15 second clip, what's the best I can bring to it before, during and after the shooting. That helped me a lot. Like to take that approach of, okay, let's make it better every time. What can I add? How can I make it better? Yeah. I think it's one percent better than the video I edited or the video I shot before. That's a huge, I like that perspective because yeah, I feel like for myself, when I stopped trying to make, well, it's kind of interesting when I stopped trying to make this next project, the masterpiece, even though I was pouring all my energy into it, when I started to release more content on a more frequent basis. But try to more improve versus this is going to be the video that I'm the most proud of and that is this and that and this and that. That would keep me stuck in the creative process. The expectation and really the perfectionism of editing maybe a video two weeks, a week longer than I then needed. But really making this one is 2% better, 2% better, 2% than trying to make this final one. I think. Right. I think I did it. Yeah, you get it. So it was great to charge for my team. It's. It's all in me, in没 Thanks babe. filming on set or you coming up with your ideas yeah give it your energy but don't think that this is the that this is the destination I think that's what I'm trying to say here the destination is far in the future let that be the video that you're working on now is the next step of something that you don't know possibly where it's leading but you're going in a direction so I think that that's when you were saying that that was bringing that memory up in me that kind of was a good shift for me as well to kind of really change gears and be more creative and have more output there was a video no no no I was filming and uh DJ Jazzy Jeff he's and he's just like full of freaking wisdom and he everything he says just sounds so epic and he said you need to die empty and when I heard that I was kind of like whoa that sounds kind of harsh what he was saying is you don't want to die with anything anything left in the tank. You know, you don't wanna die with anything left on the hard drive. You don't wanna be a musician or a filmmaker with all these projects stuck on your laptop, stuck on your hard drive, that doesn't get released because it's not perfect or good enough. You wanna blow through all that stuff and get it out and put it in the world and shoot it and edit it and create it and go. Die empty, die with it all out in the planet, you know what I mean? That kind of connected with a few other realizations and was a really big, I think, milestone and a stepping point for my personal filmmaking creation process. One of the things that I realized is that you don't think about it, but like every successful YouTuber or video creator or artist, they start from zero. They just press. They just record and put it online. And the first video, for the most part, probably will suck. Or the first movie or the first documentary that you make, it's probably gonna suck. But like, if you keep working on it, when you have 25 videos, 50, when you put on the work and you get to 100 videos, that one probably is gonna look a lot better and because you've put on the hours, people are going to follow and come to your channel. Eventually, opportunities are going to come and collaborations are going to open because you have a portfolio and you've got the experience. And that's something that's so hard to do because usually perfection is not something people are having in mind when they're doing things, but that's hiding something else. It's like the insecurity of what people are going to think of if I've put this video online, it's not perfect. I could have done this and that. But at the end of the day, people are not gonna care for your first video, even if it's super perfect. Eventually there are some weird cases where people blow out from first videos, but you have to work and it's a process It's not a one video kind of stuff It's a process and when you think and when you do it from that perspective and you're playing on the long run You enjoy it. You enjoy way more and you start like having fun You know, I love basically the advice you gave it's wasn't on the technical side. It was much more on the human side I love that because I think you know we can go on those YouTube rabbit holes where we're just going on these like technical video tutorials and not really Taking a look back and seeing the bigger picture of okay. Am I had being joyful while I'm creating am I balancing my desire to shoot videos with my Joy and not burning myself out and actually has smiling during the process So I love the fact that you brought up that side of filmmaking because I don't think that's talked about a whole lot But with that said is there any other kind of? Words of wisdom that you would like to impart definitely ah You just need to pray the record button. That's the most important step you just have to start after you start You've done the hardest step the hardest step in filmmaking is Starting to shoot to pray the record button on your camera or your cell phone Love that oh, man, I think I'm gonna get that tattooed on my Love that well, thank you so much Blatts for sharing with you and yeah, really looking forward to Shooting more and you continuing this process So thank you for being on thank you for having me. I hope To see you soon. All right. Thanks, man. Perfect",

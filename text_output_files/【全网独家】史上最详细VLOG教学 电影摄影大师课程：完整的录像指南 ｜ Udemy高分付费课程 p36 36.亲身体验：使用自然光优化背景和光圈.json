Of course, you want to frame the eyes on the third. And if we want something a little bit, let me move that up a little bit. If we want something a little bit more informal or a little bit more fun and less planned, we would shoot wider like that. So this is looking pretty good so far. I think the next thing that what we would be doing in this situation is taking a look at what in the background we can turn down to create even more separation between her and the background. So what I'm going to do is flip these lights off. So we're turning on a practical in the background. Of course. This is not going to help with lighting our subject, but it's going to make the background feel a lot more alive. So now we have more light in the background. And because we're using natural lighting in this situation, we're not getting that really good rim light that we got in the other shot. So one of the tricks that I really want to show you guys is that if you can't create enough exposure contrast in camera by turning on lights in the background, by getting a light on your subject better. What you can do is change. The shirt color or the color of the clothes that your subject is wearing. So Kimberly is going to go switch her shirt really quick to create more contrast. So as you can see, we have Kimberly that she changed her outfit to create more contrast with the background, which makes her as the subject stand out more. And we have this practical light on the back left and we have this practical light on the back right. So you can see the before and after. So now that we really got our framing and our lighting really nailed, I want to show you guys the difference between having a very shallow depth of field, a wide aperture and having a very narrow aperture with less depth of field and how big of a difference that makes with a shooting scenario like this. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to increase our aperture, which is going to bring down our depth of field and it's going to make everything in the frame a lot more in focus. And I'm going to bring up the ISO to make up for that increase in aperture so I can get the exposure right. And so here you can see the difference between an F10 with the subject and the background and the difference between an F2.8 with the subject and the background.",

The dress is as it was, a simple dress, gorgeous. Now let's spice it up. Let's start with brunch. I want to take this from morning to night. We're going to start with the military boots. Please, if you would pop that out. In the daytime, you don't want to feel overdone. You don't want it to seem like you've made too much of an effort. So that's when you can wear a flat, a sneaker, something more casual. And then it's cooler in the morning, so I'm going to add a sweater. Do I want this? Nope, I'm going to add this. Every piece I'm pulling right now is from the capsule collection. So we're using what we have in one place. Would you pop this on for me, please? You want something easy, breezy, slouchy, nothing too stuffy. It could have been either the gray sweater or the sweater. However, this one's more cropped, so I wanted to be able to really show off the skirt. If it was longer, it wouldn't do much for her proportions. I wanted to balance the proportions with something shorter. So for this brunch look, all I've done is taken the initial dress. I've added a sweater, from the capsule collection. I've added a military boot to add a bit of cool, casual, and that's it. Easy breezy. We are back to zero the dress. Now we're going to take this dress from brunch to work. The blazer from the capsule wardrobe. I'm going to add on a point of interest, the jewelry. An accessory just finishes off your look. It shows that you've truly made an effort to put a look together. This is a really cool look. I'm going to add a little bit of a This is nothing too gaudy. It's nothing too garish. You're going to work just something subtle is appropriate. The heel from the capsule wardrobe. And she's ready for work. Many people who are taller assume that they can't wear heels because they're already tall enough. If that heel gives you the posture that you want, if it makes you feel wonderful, wear a heel. A heel does just dress a look up. So it actually is the perfect way to dress for work. Next, she's probably going to go to dinner. She needs to be fed. Let's get her in something very, very simple, very, very chic. All I'm going to do is take off this jewelry. We're going to take off the jacket. We're going to take off the heel. I've chosen a boot because she wants to be comfortable, but she wants a little bit of extra height to give her the posture that she wants. If I could bend further, I would without splitting my pants, but that's not happening. The place she's going for dinner is probably not fancy enough to go for a super high heel. It doesn't need to be corporate. She wants to feel still cool and interesting. So she's gone for an animal print boot. I've given her accessories just to show that she really has made an effort for that date. She's a quick date night dinner, somewhere fancy. If you're looking to accessorize, but you don't know how to incorporate colors into the mix, go for mixed metals. Mixed metals go with everything. You don't just have to stick with a gold or a silver or a bronze or a rose gold. You can mix them all together. Mixing metals works for any age, any occasion. Dress it up more if you want to go out on a night out, wear more of it. For daytime, wear less of it, but metals are always the way to go. And I want to show you one last example. Once you're at dinner, you've got a text from your friends. You're going out to the bar. This is way too dressy for it. We're going to do a really quick final change for the night with your girlfriends. We're going to take off the necklace, please. Thank you. So she's going out to a bar, casual karaoke, drinks, maybe even some pool. So we're going to keep it relatively casual, but she still wants to feel a little bit sexy, a little bit flirty. You can wear a sneaker. Wonderful. We have the dress with a pair of sneakers. That's not going to work where she's going. We're going to layer on this. A skirt that is not from the capsule wardrobe, but it's a very simple black skirt. I'm going to turn this dress into a top. Would you slip into this for me, please? The dress is now a top. I'm going to add one final layer to make it look a little bit cooler, and she's going to be going out at night. It's probably going to get cold. Do you slip into this for me? I'm cinching. I'm cinching the sleeves to just give it a little more structure. Whenever I'm doing these little things like pushing a sleeve up or having the dress billow out of the skirt instead of just laying flat, they're all just styling tricks that you can add in that make it look like you've really put some thought into what you're wearing. You didn't just put the clothes on, you put an outfit together. You completed the outfit. We have the jacket from the capsule wardrobe, the sneakers from the capsule wardrobe, and the dress. The only addition to this was the shirt, and we created a whole new look. We have four looks for one day out of one dress. Many of you out there have incredibly busy lives. You don't have time to go home and get a whole new look, or if you do, you've probably got two minutes to quickly rinse off, get ready, get out. Having one thing that you work your whole day around, which is the dress, makes it so much easier for you to do. Now, I'm going to take this suit from my capsule wardrobe, and show you how you can really rework it and make many, many looks from one single suit. This is the first look. It could be appropriate for work. If you work in the kind of place that requires a suit, if you throw on a tie, add in a pocket square, you're good to go. It can also be great for a date night out, an evening out with friends. So, whip off that tie, keep that shirt buttoned up. It still looks sophisticated, but cool. If you really wanted to do this to make it extra casual, you take off this boot, throw on a sneaker and you're good to go. Street wear. Yes, this works as a suit. It's called a suit because it's two pieces that match. However, now I want to show you how you break them up to make them their own separate wonderful pieces. Now, for this look, I've separated out the suit. I've now just got the trousers on. I don't need the jacket for now. All I've added in is the white sneakers from my capsule wardrobe. The sweater, from my capsule wardrobe, and the leather jacket from my capsule wardrobe. The reason I put these sneakers with these trousers is because I wanted it to look a little more casual. I didn't want it to feel like a stuffy suit. I wanted to throw on a sweater as opposed to a button-up shirt, again, to make it seem more casual. And when I then take off my leather jacket, I still have a full look. I've thrown on my leather biker jacket because I want it to look cool, interesting, and a little more rebellious. I made a quick styling choice, which was to show off my ankle. I'm not wearing a sock. I've turned up my pants just one hem. I didn't need to iron it. I didn't need to sew it. It's just one quick fold-up. This is just a quick styling tip. If I have a full-length pant, it feels like a more corporate pant. Showing a little bit of ankle makes me feel a little more casual. And I want it to look like I've already considered my look. I didn't just put clothes on. And this look is another way to wear your suit without it being a full suit. You can break up your suit. I've added a little bit of a color suit into just a jacket, which is referred to as a sports coat, which is what this is. I've teamed it with a t-shirt to tone down the formal. I've teamed it with a jean to make it more casual. And I've added just a slight pop of color in a brown suede boot. All of these items are in my capsule wardrobe. With one suit, we've been able to get multiple looks. And this is just a snapshot of what you can achieve. There are so many looks that you can create that are both formal, casual, day, night. It's just about how you rework them. This is why a suit in your capsule wardrobe is imperative.

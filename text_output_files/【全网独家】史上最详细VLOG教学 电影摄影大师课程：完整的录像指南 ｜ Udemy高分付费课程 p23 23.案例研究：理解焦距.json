The millimeter, the mm on your lens equals the millimeter, and the shorter that mm number is the shorter the focal length or the wider the angle of view. A 22 millimeter is a really relatively wide angle of view, while a 200 millimeter, which is a much higher number, is a much more narrow field of view or a much more telephoto type lens. Wider is for more action oriented, a fun and playful feel. Generally, YouTube videos are shot on a much wider. Right now, we're shooting at about 22, 24. This gives a wider feel. If it's something that's more documentary style or something where you're shooting something off in a distance, you're going to want to use a telephoto lens so you can get a much more zoomed in look and a shallower depth of field. So the overall wider is more desirable for... YouTube and Instagram style, while a telephoto is like, you know, shooting things like wedding style or more of a documentary style or more of something where you want to have a more professional look, okay? The wider the angle, the less depth of field, the more everything's in focus. The shallower or the higher the focal length, the shallower than the field of view, also the shallower the depth of field. What's in focus is clear. What's out of focus is very blurry. So let me ask. Let's go back to this leaf and mountain image here. Which angle here is a wide angle and which one is a telephoto? Is the leaf wide or telephoto? Okay. Now, if you're guessing that, what would you guess would be the millimeter of this shot of the leaf? Would it be a 20 millimeter, 50 millimeter, 100, 150, 200? Let's see. Okay. So this is a 200 millimeter lens. You can tell that the camera is... Probably, yeah, six to eight or nine feet away from that leaf, but it's zoomed in and creating a very crisp image with a soft background. Now, if we look at this mountain image, would you put this as a 10 millimeter, 30 millimeter, 40, 50, 80 millimeter? It's probably going to be on the much lower end because it's a pretty wide angle. So let's see. Yep. That's a 20 millimeter. That's why we can see such a wide angle. And then we can see the field of view in this landscape. So hopefully that's making sense. You're able to kind of compile this together. Of course, I'm going to be demonstrating this later in the course. This is getting us to the point. We're all. Speaking. The same language.",

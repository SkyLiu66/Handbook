It's the text sheet. Okay. Let's name some first. Cai Cai. Cai Cai. Cai Cai. Cai Cai. Cai Cai. Cai Cai. Cai Cai. Cai Cai. Cai Cai. Cai Cai. Cai Cai. Cai Cai. Cai Cai. Cai Cai. Cai Cai. Cai Cai.

What is it? It's not right to cut into the point of view Let's take a look first, okay? I'm in a bad mood right now And then... If you think you're being scolded Then we'll let the next student go, okay? Do you want to listen to my analysis or what? I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure Okay, then the little friends here, let's take a look At the content of this section Have you done any detailed analysis here? Have you done any detailed analysis here? No, you haven't, okay? Have you done any targeted analysis? You recommend some analysis here? your experience with Amen Body Or a tip of your What are their My life is nice What are the directions and angles of your two articles? Can the students here give a comment? If you can tell us what these two articles are about, you can leave a comment. Can you see the difference? OK, you said you only read the Hong Kong Let's take a look. Hong Kong sister, 50 years old, not old enough, drank it. Apple water, such a big, obvious word. Then talk about the practice of this water, right? This step and its raw materials. This is the combination of different materials, right? OK, let's take a look. Very simple and clear. Can you understand? What is this? No makeup, no color. You are a beauty blogger, right? Then how is it a this? Right? And what are the particles you want to disassemble? Apple, vegetarian, tea. This thing is so obvious. If I'm in the information stream, I can see the difference between apple and vegetarian. I know it's about the drinking method. It shouldn't be called a drink. Then, Hong Kong sister, 50 years old, not old enough, drank it. The text and the corresponding pictures can be directly typed into the work. Let people know that I drink this thing to nourish my salt. But your thing, your ingredients are more than this. Vegetarian, this, and this, I need to read it to understand it. And this word is so small. And it becomes a face-only sticker, not a sticker. No color, feels like a makeup blogger. I don't understand who is your audience. Then I can't do it, I'm leaving. OK? OK? Then you need to do a test on this thing. You need to do, a test. Because you don't have a click rate here. We don't know if this is a cover title or not. We can't know. So we can only do the test, do the experiment. OK? OK? I've told you the difference between you two. And the solution is because we don't know the details. So we can't deny what's wrong with you. Because all the data analysis, without data support, there is no way to make scientific judgment. So what I just said is all after analysis, how to verify the speculation. This is what we talked about in the data analysis class. OK? OK? OK, your reply, I'm done. Including the words on your drawing, and other things. I've talked about it just now. Do you have any other questions? OK, then our next student, is he in the African Bureau? If yes, give him a point. What's his problem? I think the article is too long after it's published. The audience thinks there's too much content. Consider how many times you should publish similar articles in the future. So what's your problem? You've been referring to 2022. I will also look back. At that time, there was no content like that in the platform. So your question is asking me whether what's the reason for the divide by и so on.. Can you elaborate on your question? Is the African Bureau not active? Ahem. If you are, please type 1 and tell us what your question is. Let's talk about the next student. Is JJQ here? JJQ and Lala, if you are, please type 1. Oh, you are here. I think there is too much content. Your question is to ask me if there is too much content in your article. Is that what you mean? Parents must see that nature is affecting your child. You are too broad-minded from 0 to 17 years old. You are too broad-minded from 0 to 17 years old. You have to see it before he is an adult. His interest is completely different. Or 0 to 17 years old? 0 to 17 years old. I am a person who wants to take the college entrance exam. There is no need to see your article. Although your industry report may say something like this, but your age covers too much, brother. You can say that in our industry, children of this age need this. But you can't post it on the Internet. When you post it online, it's two times. Do you know? The industry is the industry. Posting to the self-media is the self-media. Because you need to be appropriate and popular. I have a kindergarten parent in Xiaohongshu. Right? For example, Yuqing's child is going to kindergarten. He is going to elementary school soon. He must be concerned about something different from a 15-year-old parent. A 15-year-old parent may be paying attention to the world. A 15-year-old parent may be paying attention to the world. A 15-year-old parent may be paying attention to the world. A 15-year-old parent may be paying attention to the world. He may be paying attention to the world. He may be paying attention to school. He may pay attention to education. Although you say that these things are taken out of school when you are in your teens. But if it's put in China, it won't make sense. So, first of all, the thing you wrote here is wrong. It's too extreme. Then look at your paper. It's not correct. It's incorrect. 没了,就这几张图。 就是你说的这个, 对于我来说没有什么信息增量。 如果我是一个家长来说, 你只告诉我了, 告诉我为什么,对吧? 为什么,就是是什么为什么。 但是更多的人是想要这么做, 理解我。 所以你能够看到, 你的同行大部分做的是一些 解决方案类的, 或者是什么自然游戏, 自然手工之类的东西, 它是符合大众人性的。 所以如果上次说了, 你要发这样的内容, 你就发这个沉淀在你的内容, 你的账号里就可以了, 然后就去做下一篇就行了,好吗? 就是不管长还是不长, 你短也好,长也好, 这些内容都是一些 是什么为什么, 这些东西, 什么自然教育能给孩子带来什么, 那看完了之后我干嘛呢? 我没有需要要收藏的地方, 理解吗? 就是你这是一个类似于一个书的岛屿, 书的岛屿, 比如说你这是一篇一个家长什么, 或者一个城, 机构, 自然教育讲师之类的一个岛屿的书, 告诉他们我们这个环境, 大家都在屋子里不出去了, 然后呢就是四个人都知道, 也不能说这么绝对, 就是大部分人都知道, 但是受困于限制的条件, 我没有金钱去游学, 我没有时间去什么森林公园, 我干嘛干嘛, 那你可以给到一些, 你看到同行做的好的, 大部分是给解决方案具体的, 落地的, 可以拿去急用的那些东西, 理解吗? 所以这些, 你不管长还是短, 你写成这样注定是没有人要看到, OK吗? 你能理解吗? 你除非去结合一个热点事件, 哪个小孩跳楼了, 他没有接受, 这个有点牵强, 懂吗? 除非, 除非什么, 去东北的那些砂糖局, 他们是去自然教育, 一个自然教育机构游学, 然后大家对这个有一些议论, 然后你趁此去进行一下科普, 那的话你就是这种, Nobody cares, 大家要的是一个落地的, 实操的解决方案, 懂吗? 那你你就如果想要有一些数据, 你就往那方面靠, 如果说你就想填补这里的科普空白, 那你就去, 如果你没有办法用一些视频, 这类的形式, 你突然也只能在你的能力水平里写成这样子了, 那就这样子, 好吧, 我们就不纠结这个, 因为上次你也讲过了, 你说你就只能这样子, 站, 而且, 但是它有更多更好的形式, 对吧? 比如说视频的形式展现你们的在教育活动的场景, 让人家知道, 哦, 就是原来是这样子样子的, 不然的话它就不那么生动, OK吧? 所以就是你这里面可以做的任务有很多, 取决于你们的条件啊, 人力啊, 精力啊, 或者你们想要展示, 的东西到底是什么, 好吧? 你是大理好哉的吗? 就这里面有做的, 有可以做的有很多, 但取决于你们能不能做, 有没有精力, 自己做, 好吧? 有做的好的也有很多, 像一些科普类的视频类的呀, 讲解类的呀, 有很多, 但是你这种对于受众来说, 它必然不是被小红书的受众喜欢吧, 那哪怕你说比如说你这里有自然书籍, 你去整理一坨书单, 也一定是对于用, 用户来说获得感更强, 用户不需要知道, 哦, 我什么自然教育可以给孩子身心健康之类的, 他知道了之后, 他看完了就是看完了, 但是如果你说那怎么解决, 你的里面的就有一些什么自然书籍的清单啊, 自然什么的, 布拉布拉之类的, 干货类的也好啊, 怎么类的也好, 好吧?

You are here. We are about to start talking. Can you please reflect on your thought on this topic? Actually, this is the biggest problem I am facing right now. The biggest problem is the topic. I don't know how it is in other areas. The big problems are less in the workplace. There are more people who are on the front lines. There are more people who are on the front lines. And then, whenever there are problems, during that period, everyone would write the same topic. It was already written bad. So, when I choose a topic, I often look at it for a few hours and don't know what I can write. And this video, I also wrote it. The teacher told me that I can choose some topics for the end of the year. And then, I saw this and I thought I could write it. I probably want to give the workplace people some advice on what they can do at the end of the year. It is for the future. Whether it is to jump into the tide or to advance, it can be helpful. Like this. Okay. First of all, let's talk about the topics later. I don't know what to write. Let's talk about the specific topics first. Can I write one? Okay. First of all, let me say this. If I finish reading, let's first look back at the SOP content of our newbie. I just said that when I saw this, I didn't know what you were talking about. It is the three-piece set. Let's look at the three-piece set first. I can't see what kind of person I am. As a workplace person, it is divided into many parts. Right? I don't know what kind of person should be picked up. This thing. Okay. So, I don't necessarily take it into consideration. I am thinking about what is your target? What are my steps? As a judge, and the same goes for other students, when you are creating, as a judge, I will think about what others have done. Let me see what others have done. Then I will look at it. I will look at it. The one you are targeting is 600. It is fine. If they are so good that the ceiling is 600, then you may be a rookie. Maybe only six or 60. It may be very good. Because it is the ceiling of your target. Right? I will think about it with this kind of thinking. Then I will say, why did you find such a bad data to target? Then we will look at it. Then I will restore such a topic. In the whole, in the whole book, what is the demand and the popularity? Then we will find that not many people, it is all the likes of the other books. Then we will look at it. There are only two books left. What is the difference between the likes of the other three books? At this time, the first difference I saw, is that at the end of the year, the new workplace workers have started to do these things. Right? First, he added a new product. At the same time, he cut a picture. Cut a picture, he will have new materials. You are too small. I can't see it clearly. Understand? Then at this time, he cut a picture in it. He added a new person. Called the year-end summary, skill assessment, promotion, consideration, jump, blah, blah, blah. Maybe we can only guess. We can only guess. We don't know the click rate of other people's backstage, the number of likes of the little eyes. At this time, we can only guess. Because when we disassemble the newspaper, it is also a pixel issue. We just guess the pixel. Is it possible that the year-end summary, blah, blah, blah, can include a part of this kind of person in it? Then let people click in to see what he is talking about in the end. It seems to be called the year-end summary, promotion, speech, and the summary. That's it. There are some of these. Then we go to the comment area. What is it? It's organized by the leader. Let's take a look at this person's comment area. How to click it in the comment area? It's really good. What is it? It's some laughing. Well, this time, we're going to guess what people are concerned about in this. No one cares about the summary. It's the goal planning. We can't see it. It's too little data. We can't see it. Then you have to make a consideration. What do you want to say about this? First, you have to consider. First, you have to consider whether this topic is worth writing. Then the second one is, you have to think about whether this topic is worth writing. Let's look at your content itself. I'm not sure. You wrote it. How do you make it smaller? Let's look at your content itself. It's a mess. This one. I took this page. Let's look at your content. Why did you post so much? I have to look at so much. Other keywords. This one. I'm not sure about this one. The pain points of the users. The pain points of the users. There is no specific scene or specific type of people. In the end, you are preparing to jump the fence. Now you have to do these four things. Maybe it will be more accurate than this. Then your content output will be more accurate. Then you might say, what are you investigating? Now you have to go to the market to investigate. Then start updating the resume. Then start to invest. Or what? I don't know what the specific steps should be. Or what is the specific execution strategy? What is the specific execution strategy? Maybe you should prepare the resume first. I'm not sure about this. Or you should do this first. Maybe you should change it. I'm just saying. Change it to something like the business owner who is going to jump the fence at the end of the year. These four things. Then, update the resume, investigate the dynamics. Then plan for the next year's plan. What will happen to this company if it is not available? If it is not available, we have to start preparing for the next step. Then we start to investigate the market. According to the market dynamics, we start to investigate and update the resume. Then we start to invest. Or tell everyone that you are an experienced person. Now there are many points. Although there are many points, many companies are short of positions. You can invest now. Many HRs need to stock up first. Stock up first. Or as an experienced person, don't invest now. Because HRs won't look at you anymore. You have to start at the beginning of the year. I'm just saying. This kind of specific person will be more tired than you are now. Because you are a little bit unrealistic. Do your real workplace people really do these things? Do you? I think the situation is too broad now. No, no. You are a little bit like saying fake words. What is fake words? You told me that workplace people have to do these things. But the real market, the real workplace people may not update the resume or go to the market dynamics. Even in the year, a small part of people will do the planning direction. I'm just saying that for the company, I want to write OK. I want to fill in. But these are fake things. Do you understand? Do you understand what I mean? It's not what the real workplace people will do. So I saw this. I don't have any feelings at all. It has nothing to do with me. Or one is your... Or that sentence, I just asked the question of the last student. Before you write this, who is your target? What do you want to say to him? You have to think about this first. What kind of problem do you want to solve? If you fill in this question before you write the article, then your article will have a very object-like feeling. Do you understand what I mean? Yes, I understand. Right? So you can only be very empty now. And the real workplace people will do these things, right? No, they won't. Give me some feedback. I'm not a real workplace person anymore. Those who are in the comments section, can you tell me? Do you do these things? If you don't, let me see. If you do, let me see. It's possible. Something like that. Right? It's not a real thing. Maybe it's based on what you see on the table. Maybe it's based on what other people write. Or maybe it's based on what you imagine. Right? I'm not sure. Maybe you can do... Maybe you can do the same thing as I do. Or maybe you can do the same thing as I do. Or maybe you can do the same thing as I do. But it's too much. One, it doesn't have the information. Two, it doesn't have a specific solution. Three, it doesn't know what to do. I'm done. Do you understand? From my point of view, the problem is that you don't have a specific solution. I think it's like this. Okay. This is a type of... Okay? Can you understand this part? Yes, I can. Okay. Then let's look at the next one. Okay. So these two, actually, these two, these two might be the points that you mentioned at the beginning of the live stream. You don't know what to write, right? Let's take a look. What company are you in right now? Tell us. I don't know right now. What the f**k? What? I really want to go to the toilet right now. You're eating, aren't you? Pera. No. No, we've had a commotion with each other recently, right? Actually, you know. Ok. Not grow water for five days. I thought you would . Ok, the only reason is that you casting arrived. He's in trouble. M novelist. M slcus. Where exactly? I think he's in trouble. But in fact, the camera wasn't on earlier. To alguém the camera wasn't on earlier. To someone later on Let's look at this one. This one is... It's still the same sentence. Let's look at the target. It's a collection of micro-blogs. And it triggered some suspense in the comments section. Do you understand what I mean? Look. Did you see this? The comments section is basically full of these things. The data is not bad. But look at these. Basically, it's a collection of the core things. The core things plus some suspense-related topics. And then some comments to forward to the police. The comments section to the police. The operations like this. It's a bit random. Do you understand? And it includes... Its cover is a micro-blog. And a slogan. But it's half-closed and half-open. It's like a hole. It will trigger it to open. But your cover is just a... What is it? A little doll. Then we'll go and verify it. Verify it. Verify whether it is a randomness. Just... You... You... You restore it. You tell me. What is your idea of finding this topic? What did you think at that time? What is your step? Tell me. Your content creation step. I was in a group and saw that the topic of forgetting yourself is more popular now. So I searched it. I felt that if it is related to the workplace, it is about forgetting wealth. So I searched it. I searched a few pages and wrote it down. What is your step? How did you verify it? Can you tell me? I searched about forgetting wealth. And I looked at how many people wrote it. What content did they write? Yes. What is your step? And then? And then I looked at the latest and the hottest. What is it like? And then I found a title that I wanted to write. And then I refer to his writing. How did you create the content in it? Is it something you did yourself? Or the other person's? The content in it is also... I think it makes sense. I will write a little bit with him. And then I will add a few more that I think of. And then maybe I will see how others write it. OK. OK, so let's go back to your... First of all, let's take a look. What is the purpose of your account? I just do it and then I get to the point. So what kind of people do you get to the point with your position chart? What kind of people do you get to the point with your position chart? What kind of questions? What kind of things do you share? What kind of form do you share? What kind of things? You can repeat this. The one in our position chart. I forgot. At that time, I was thinking about I wanted to provide some solutions for some new workers in the workplace. Or for those who want to switch jobs. OK. What kind of solutions? Specific. I mean, mainly in terms of my own professional planning. I don't know. I feel like it's not very clear to make a position chart. So you often switch jobs. And then you have this experience. What does that mean? Professional transformation or what? Or you say you have been doing something and now you have been transformed into something you do? Have experience? Can you be more specific? Well, I have switched jobs. I have switched jobs in different positions and companies. And then, well, I have some problems. I haven't found a job that suits me. And now, well, I have a vacancy. And I want to... What do you want to do? Just to help those who were not happy with their jobs before. I want to help those who were not happy with their jobs before. I want to help them find other ways to get out of this. OK. What was your experience like before? Well... No experience. No, it's like this. Well... What do you want to help them find other ways to get out of this? Is it like you? What is it? You... Well... What do you want to help them with? What kind of help? I don't know. Now... What I want to provide... When I was in the workplace before, I wanted to share some ideas and experiences. What can I do to help them? I was thinking of some things like how to do things in the workplace and how to work in the workplace. Well... Well... I didn't think very clearly about what I could do to help others. I can help others. What are you good at? What are you good at in your job? What am I good at? I'm good at... doing PPT. Is it something you're good at? Or is it just a side job? I don't know. Is it something that others will ask you to do? Something that you do better than others? Or is it just a side job? It's something that most people do better than others. Then you can start from the best part of your job, and find some possibilities. Do you understand what I mean? You're a designer, right? Yes. What was your previous job? My previous job was drawing pictures, writing plans, doing PPT, reporting, and so on. Do you think you can bring out something from this? Just imagine it. Yes. I think you can bring out some skills. But there are a lot of things that others can do. Do you think there are people who can do these things? There are definitely people who can do these things. Then you can search for them, verify them, and see if they're still there. For example, the key words you know within the past three months. Are there still people who can produce good data? Yes. That means there are still people who need it. Do you understand what I mean? It's not like two years ago, there was an excellent content that I can't do now. It's still the SOP of the newbie who made the content. Yes. Do you understand? Yes. Don't challenge what you don't know. Or don't challenge what makes you suffer. I think if you make the four questions you're solving now, will you have some pain? Tell me honestly. Yes. There will be a little. I can feel that if this kind of thing, something like a point of view, it's like a point of view. It's like a point of view. It's like a point of view. It's like a point of view. It's like a point of view. But it actually tests one's strong point of view. It's really brave. If you just keep silent and work hard, don't say, blah blah blah and some strong point of view. That's it. It's like what I wrote myself. That strong point of view is like your brain is heated up and you're sitting on your phone, 十分重能打出来的那种强表达语的东西。 不然的话如果你只是模仿别人是很难模仿出效果的。 是,但就是我自己其实是有一些观点的, 但是就是如果是按照这个选题, 然后拆解这个步骤去做的话, 就很容易就跟着别人去走了。 那你的观点是什么呢?可以举个例子吗? 举个例子。 就比如说这个打工而已别太上头嘛, 这个我肯定也会有自己的观点嘛, 如果我自己写的话, 可能就是去说一些自己的故事啊, 自己的经验啊, 然后怎么怎么样。 啥意思? 那你觉得你的自己的经验故事是不能说还是什么? 不是不能说啊,就是拆解那个对标嘛, 就是看那个对标它是文案结构是怎么写的, 它写的大概啥内容,我就被它带跑了。 它怎么写我就怎么写。 那你就是这样子嘛,先流淌自己的观点, 就是你先流淌你全部你想写的东西, 就是你不看它的内容, 先把你想说的全部写出来, 然后你再去拆解别人的记忆法, 然后再去把你写的去包装成有逻辑的, 或者是加一点手艺,懂吗? 嗯嗯嗯。 就是你先去, 就是如果你在某一个点上面有强烈的表达语, 你就把这个东西就在手机上, 在电脑上, 框框框一顿写, 就哪怕它甚至你用训飞什么玩意, 飞书妙计什么玩意的, 然后把你的嘴巴去讲, 然后讲出来之后, 我们再去根据, 因为你是新手嘛, 一定要去做拆解的, 去拆市面上的东东, 发现哦, 他这里面有这些爆款因子, 然后我刚刚流淌的这些我要把它重组, 但是里面的内容就是你的, 就是也许说啊, 这里面好像要再加一个点, 那我就去加, 你说不得, 就是好像爆款都是有这样的那种开头, 或者那种结果, 或者要加那些元素, 好像都是必需品, 那你就加上, 懂吗? 但是如果说, 但是你不能说, 他写了这个观点, 你也写这个观点, 那你这有点就叫洗稿, 懂吗? 先流淌再上手艺, 大家把这句话抠一下, 先流淌再上手艺, 抠在评论区, 这是那种观点, 就是那种有自己强烈的观点, 观点这种内容的做法, 当然比如说像那个, 啦啦这种搞健身操的, 你不能先自己跳, 那你万一这个角度不对, 或者什么的不对, 那你要重跳一遍,对吧? 不同的内容, 不同的弄法, 好吧, 就是首先哈, 先解决JJQ的一个问题叫做, 我好像不知道写什么的问题, 首先你先流淌, 再上手艺, 完事了呢, 这是一个点哈, 另一个点就是, 嗯, 你找到就是作为一个职场的号, 就是你作为一个现在入局的人, 并且是一个可能有某些内容不是很擅长的人, 也不知道要说什么的人, 给你的建议就是, 先去找到你最, 就是因为职场人, 他最大的优势他就是他有一个, 你反正肯定工作了好, 也是工作了几年的人对不对? 对吧? 你是不是跟我同一届的? 是吗? 然后, 那, 那咱们就是工作了好多年了, 那一定是有一些技能, 手艺, 职场教, 职场的一些, 呃, 技能在身上的对吧? 而且你说你是一个设, 而且你是一个就同级设计什么玩意的, 就是这种就是你是一个设计师对吧? 然后你肯定有这上面降维打击不是设计师的人的技能, 理解吗? 也许在你们那个公司, 你说你在你们公司都比别人好了, 那你在别的不, 不是个有设计什么基因的地方, 那比一个跟一个根本不会设计的人来比, 那你PPT不管是PPT还是啥事也好, 就是降维打击别人了, 那这时候你再去用我们新手做内容SOP去验证, 那些你你梳理出来你觉得你比一边的同事好的一些东西, 一些技能关键词去搜, 去看一下他们都做成什么样, 是分享, 还是PPT的设计的方法, 还是blah blah, 还是什么什么, 还是PPT的工具模板网站, 还是什么什么等等, 就还有个就还是我们那套路径吧对吧, 还是那步骤, 然后再去看它的实效性, 不是那种两年前一年前发财能货的东西, 那么你完全可以去降维党级别人了, 因为需求永远在, 对吧, 需求永远在, 我喜欢吃毛肚的人, 我ZZQ开的一个火锅店我一定会点毛肚, 然后徐义脸大, 什么徐义脸不大, 就是那个陈子老师开的火锅店, 他也一定会进去点毛肚, 那毛肚这个需求永远在, 好吧, 嗯, 除非这个, 动物被灭绝了, 毛肚不存在了, 好吧, 所以还是你一个两个点你再总结一下吧, 嗯, 明白了, 你总结一下你今天获得的核心动清单, 浅浅的总结一下吧, 嗯, 就是你觉得你接下来可以做些什么, 嗯, 就是先要明确自己到底想写什么, 然后再去验证有哪些可能的选题, 就被那些对标牵着鼻子走了, 然后的话就是可以从自己擅长的地方入手, 就各个方向都试一下, 然后找到自己适合的方向吧, 嗯, 那你觉得你下一步你可以做些什么呢? 下一步? 嗯, 我再, 我再想想, 然后再做一下自己的选题吧, 主要我就是直上这方向, 因为我天天也看挺多, 就感觉现在报的选题就本身也很少了, 我们现在 lanç不出任何选题, 我也可以投 MID连你的体验币吧。 嗯。 然后致然回 我这场一万又这几个月了, It has a lot of needs and pain points. Right? And you can't... And now, unless you're exporting something like a skill, if it's something like a perspective, if you've left a job for a long time, it may not be able to export for too long. You may be left out, or you may have lost the sense and thinking power of the field. Because you're not there anymore. Do you understand? But these are not your current problems. If you can keep up with 10 or 20 episodes, you're already a very good beginner. You don't need to think about what you can't keep up with. You don't need to think about what you're good at. You need to think about whether you're good at something and whether you can be shown in it. Because, for example, if you share... These don't affect your advertising. If you want to follow this path, sharing the efficiency of the industry, how to do that, whether it's software or hardware, etc. It's better than you sharing something meaningless. For example, the first question we just talked about. The first question is meaningful. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. So, although these are content diagnosis, but the farthest point is your topic, your overall positioning. Because these are all one-sided, and you've written a lot of topics. We've talked about the solution in this. We've talked about the live diagnosis in the previous weeks. But these are not your core. Okay? Okay. I understand. Okay. Thank you, Huaxiao. While you're at it, you can go and plan again before the Zoom class ends. And then you can talk to your Zoom teacher again. Okay? Okay. If you need to go in a new direction, or something like that, okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. That's it for now. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Okay. Next. Next is... Lala. Meet her organizers. Here she is. Good morning, everyone. I know you're watching via VR, it's really 17 dist 285. I can hear it. It's offline, man instead of real life. Sorry about that. I'll try.

Yes. For example, in TikTok, there's a dragon on the left, and a dragon on the right. What's that? Is there a song like this before? Yes, there was a... I forgot. Draw a dragon with me on the left. Yes, that's what I meant. At this time, what everyone needs is this kind of atmosphere. Then, the fingers movement of the mouth, the popular songs of the internet, some jewelry on the hands, and some pretty girls and boys. This kind of... Do you really want to learn a song that has a yearly atmosphere? Or do you really want to use this song to... Yes. To dye your fingers? Or do they just want to dye your fingers? They just want to dye your fingers. It's just a combination of the spring festival dance. Then you have to look at it again. You have to look at it again. If dyeing your fingers is a combination of the spring festival dance, these two elements must be combined. You have to see what the content of the song is like. It's here to listen to the dance. It's the same as the previous dyeing of your fingers. For example, this blogger... I'll click on it. If this blogger taught all of his dance in this way, then he's saying congratulations today and dancing la la la today. There's no difference. Right? He just changed a dance and practiced with everyone. He's just dancing against everyone and then everyone follows. There's no difference. At this time, the cover picture, the form, the benefits and needs of the cover mark, the words of the pain are all the same. Or if you think he needs some funny and funny contrasts, it's not important to follow up on this thing. Then you go to exaggerate it. Do you understand what I mean? You have to go to his real problem. You go to solve his real problem. Or you have to... I think this piece... It's not important to follow up on this thing. You have to correct it. Then you look at the correctness. Or you have to dye your fingers and dance this dance at home. You go to see others dye their fingers and dance this dance. What is the basic routine? Do you understand? He just changed a red sweater. And then add some of this. Then his normal cover is still... He still uses the red sweater. This kind of user likes to be told by others that there is such a clean scene. Then he dances with this. But this person seems to be normal. Okay. Do you understand my point of view? Yes. Okay. Then your question seems to be... Do you have any other questions? Yes. I sent a video of me wearing a normal dress and dancing in a small dress to Mr. Yu Qin. Then he suggested that I can do a contrast. A contrast between before and after makeup. But I have no idea about this. It's about contrast and weight loss. I don't know if this can be used. I don't understand what you mean. What do you mean by contrast and weight loss? You are... You are saying that I don't have... You are saying that I don't have the sense of objectivity. You are saying that I don't see your... your... your things. So I don't know what your teacher is telling you. It's like... You two's things are not... You are expressing something that I don't know. So you... Either you are more specific. Or... You are expressing your problem clearly. Well... Let me think about this question. Yes, because I... I am not a client. I don't know what you mean by putting on a dress and a suit. He means that I... I look good in a dress. And the dress is what you see now. And I wear sportswear. That's it. But I look good in a dress. He means that I am making a contrasting video. To see if I can use contrast to achieve the purpose of the weight loss. Then let the teacher find the thing he said. Let the teacher send you what he said. If you can't do it, then don't do it. You can say, teacher, I don't understand what you mean. Can you give me a example? Understand? Maybe the teacher just said it casually. But if you really... If you really want to do it, then let the teacher give you what he said. Otherwise, you don't know what it means. Understand? Okay. Yes. To sum up, I still have to continue to verify this... This... Where did I make a mistake? Yes, first of all, you must change your title. You can't understand it now. Secondly, your cover is a little bit... A little bit messy. Right? You have too many elements. It's a little too ENFP. It's too much. Your title... The elements on your cover. Yes. Understand? Yes. Right? Including what? Ten days of enjoyment. Tell him what? Too awesome. These... How to say? We don't know if there are so many... Everyone wants to see so many emotions in it. Yes. But the value of emotions in it still depends on the point of interest on the cover of someone else you have disassembled. Understand? Yes. You only need to see enough. Disassemble enough. For example, you say now, Teacher told me that my title needs to be improved. My cover needs to be improved. How to improve it? Go and collect 100 titles. Go and collect and screenshot 100 covers. To disassemble their resonance. What is it? It's... It's... It's a popular dance song. The more the dance song is popular, the better the data. Yes. Or the one on top of it. Everyone puts that kind of big technique. Or that one. People who are a little bit fatter will use the word big technique. Or what? Because I didn't help you do this step. So I don't know. Right? I haven't done it. I haven't done enough research. So I can't tell you. It must be the word big technique. You have to go. Or go to the big plate. Most people have this resonance. Or what? Or you do an experiment. To verify it. I changed one. It seems like the data is better than before. If we are all just guessing and backing up now. You need to research and summarize resonance. Research and summarize resonance. Do an experiment to verify. Yes. Do you understand? Yes. Okay. And then the cover and the tag are all needed to be added and improved. Okay. Okay? Yes. Yes. Then, let's take a look at your content itself. Come and practice. Hit the top five times. It's a small 40 meters. Then you won't look at it later. It's just a normal practice. There is no big problem with this. You are mainly practicing the basic technique. You are practicing the basic technique. You are practicing the basic technique. You are practicing the basic technique. You are practicing the basic technique. You are practicing the basic technique.  because today you are dunno how to use these tips and tricks, because it's returning in the 있어요 . Yes. You are learning from a personal joy area. Like a tutorial video. It's wearing a30-day-gay shirt but instead, it's annually sharing a burnout routine at home. Yes. Because I know that I cordially with it and I don't learn a solid chili��, I teach it over and over. If… I know that because I don't have a professional br persistence. Poobo nowadays. Well, I'm videos training and occasional skaters so that must have the original idea right. That's right. Because if we're really working on the content information for learning, what we can learnорт the actual content. Just about video training I'm not teaching with them. I'm only with. Of course. So this is... Let me see... You didn't add any backpacks. You just practiced, right? Yes, but didn't you say that the front part of the waist was 5kg? That it was 4kg for 5 days? Because some training videos, for example, I want to do some leg kicks in the next step. It will be more detailed. If you think that this is how you started, you can do it. Because some training videos, in the next step, there will be some words, like backpacks, etc. If you want to do it like this, you can do it. But the most important thing now is to solve the point of letting others click on your video. Okay? We also had a trainee who was training. She kept practicing. No, not constantly practicing. Because... She was practicing every day. She was practicing almost every day. She was practicing every day. Then she... There was a video, and the data was good. Then she slowly started to improve. Yes, actually I... I was thinking that maybe it was because of my... It's just that I didn't change much. So maybe I wasn't as attracted to it. So actually my mentality was still relatively stable. But sometimes I would feel that... I would practice for more than an hour, and then I would pick up some random stuff. And then I would be so slow, and not like other people, my hands and feet were not coordinated. I would feel a little bit of a sense of joy when I jumped. I would... I would find this point very difficult. And then after you finished today, I knew that the content of the video was not yet considered. The issue of the cover was still to be considered. Yes, because... I'm not saying that the content is not to be considered. Because your content is actually different from others. It's not that different, right? Because you're just following the video. Your content... First of all, your content is not particularly... extremely standard. Right? Extremely like becoming someone else's coach. You're like... Like a beginner's attitude, practicing with someone else. Then why would most people watch you? Why would they watch you? Why not watch the original video directly?

If you're his fans, why do you watch him? He gives you a feeling that is, although very fleshly, a feeling that is cute, a feeling that is cute. You can possibly get some emotional value from him. Why do you watch him everyday? Because you feel... That's how you feel. And you also like him. You like him. You two live in the same house. Right? Right?

We live in a world that largely runs on cycles. The natural world is full of cycles. Things are born and then die, and the cycle is continued by their offspring. Similarly, we experience cycles in our personal lives. Our sleep patterns, interest in our work, feelings of well-being, and energy throughout the day, to name a few, all operate on cycles. Despite a lifetime of evidence that this can never work, we as human beings still try over and over again to abandon the cyclical nature of our lives. We still cling to the belief that we can make the enjoyable parts of our cycles last forever, or that we can banish the less desirable parts for good. We stubbornly hold on, often subconsciously, to the idea that if we just die at bed and sleep, we will be able to do better and exercise better, and meditate more consistently, and get a better handle on our sleep, and bring whatever other factors in our lives under our complete control that we can expect to feel good all the time. We think that if we can just get a little better at doing this or that, we will finally be able to find ourselves perpetually full of energy and a lust for life, untiring in the pursuit of whatever it is we think we should be accomplishing. Lao-tzu recognize the futility of these sorts of ideals. Returning is the motion of the Tao. Yielding is the motion of the Tao. Yielding is the way of the Tao. The ten thousand things are born of being. Being is born of not being. The Tao operates in cycles. The way of Tao is understanding and accepting these cycles as a part of life and adapting to them. Sometimes things are, and sometimes they aren't. Rather than frantically trying to control things that defy complete control, we are much better off to identify what factors we can influence and allow those we can't influence to be what they are. There are many ways we can use this advice in our personal life. We can use it to help others. We can use it to help others. We can use it to help others. If you don't mind me sharing a couple of personal examples from my own life, I'll try and illustrate this. I have always been a person that greatly enjoys being outside. I love summer and fall for all the opportunities they provide to get out in nature. But for years now, winter has been a real struggle for me. I live in a part of the world where winter means cold, snow, and less sunlight. Because of these and maybe a few other factors, although I enjoy winter all through December when it still feels like a novelty. I have a lot of time to think about what I want to do next. I have a lot of time to think about what I want to do next. By about the middle of January, I'm sick and tired of it. I tend to get pretty gloomy around this time and just kind of have a harder time picking myself up emotionally. However, this last year, because of changes in my work and the things I was doing with my family, I ended up getting outside a lot more during the winter. Interestingly, as I spent more time out in the winter weather, I came to enjoy and really appreciate it for what it was. This has been one of the longest winters I can remember, and it's only in the last week or two that I think I've really enjoyed it. I think I've really enjoyed it. I think I've really enjoyed it. I think we've finally seen the last of the snow, but honestly, I haven't even minded it. Even though I wasn't really even going about it intentionally, I was able to accept and embrace the season for what it was by getting out into the weather and experiencing what the season made available to experience, rather than just lamenting the absence of summer from indoors. My second example is from when I was studying at university. Now, I suppose it's only fair to make the disclaimer that I'm probably not the person to be throwing around advice on studying, since I did end up dropping out of college myself. However, my grades were very good when I was there, and the semester I dropped out was the semester I would have been able to take advantage of a pretty decent scholarship because of my grades, so it's not like I was just failing everything. At any rate, this was just something that worked for me, and the whole point of this video is to find the cycles that exist in your own life and adapt to them, so I hope you guys will take this example as an illustration of this principle, rather than as specific advice on how to study. When I was at college, I found I was having problems getting my work done. I worked part-time and was taking a full course load, and I often found myself staying up late to finish my work. However, I noticed that after a certain point in the night, my work became much slower, and I would often have to stay up lengthy amounts of time at night in order to finish what would have taken me far less time during the day. So instead, I started going to bed earlier and waking up early the next morning to finish my work. Between how much better I felt in the morning, and the added pressure to finish what was now due in just a couple of hours, I found that I was much more efficient with getting my tasks done. And I felt better as well. Of course, Taoism isn't just about boosting your mood or increasing your productivity. There are cycles in just about all areas of our lives. We start young and grow old. Those we love are born and die, and we eventually follow them. Understanding these cycles can help us to accept them, and accepting them helps us to find peace. If you're interested in talking about these sorts of things, I would really recommend you to join the Discord, where we talk about this stuff all the time, and break down and discuss each chapter of the Tao Te Ching individually. The link is in the description below if you're interested. And as always, thanks for watching, and I will see you all tomorrow for chapter 41. Peace and blessings.",

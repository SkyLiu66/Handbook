    "data": " I'm just going to guide you guys on how to buy on ACC market so of late I've been making a couple of purchases on this particular platform and for those who do not know what ACC market is all about they do sell channels website pages so talking of anywhere from Instagram accounts YouTube account Twitter accounts everything that is account based you can actually get them on that particular platform and this is how it works so normally people sell their personal pages or they just create everything build everything from scratch and then sell it on a particular platform. It's not a new thing it's been around just that a lot of people actually did not have an idea of this platform. We open a new tab and then ACC market I actually have an account with them I recently opened it and I've been making a couple of I mean sales there I've been buying actually but I think in future I'm actually looking to making more business on that particular platform because it seems legit and yeah so so far I've bought about two channels two YouTube channels it's not this one. But I have two channels that I'm still working on you do get time limits on accounts whenever you buy them. So I'm still waiting for everything to be in order as you open the platform this is the interface that you get and then as you guys can see here you do have YouTube you do have Instagram you do have Facebook Telegram Twitter Tick Tock like I don't know which which platform is this and then this code so you do have different types of platform here. Let's say for instance you need a YouTube account to buy or you need to buy this one. I will take it. I will take it. So I see that you have two channels. In the description of the video you can see that you get two channels but you need to buy a one two channel as well. to do is it's already highlighted YouTube so you just need to check what your preference are if you need a channel which is already monetized you need to click on the monetization enabled and then normally it's best you click on verify identity so what this actually means is it will give you a list of sellers who are verified on the platform which means you can actually trust them but it's not always that ideal because some people actually on the platform that are not verified yet but they are still legit so either way you can still click it and then you have to confirm how many subscribers do you need if let's say you need a maximum of 2,000 subscribers and a price you can set a price limits maybe your budgets that you actually planning to buy so let's say our maximum budget is about you know $200 so that is the amount that you are planning to buy the channel and then income actually means the amount that the channel makes so let's say in every month the channel makes about $50 a month $1,000 a month it all depends so you just have to go for the one that you actually normally it's best the channel has a bit of income so you can know that okay cool this channel is already running ads it's already monetized you can basically trust it but it's not always ideal you can still live it so once you are done with everything here you click on search and it's going to give you a list of I mean all the channels available they are sellers the prices are also looking at the first one we do have one tech if you guys can see down it says luxury and to motion what what is this luxury and motivation I must go back to school so it says $40 here with 1180 subscribers so it's not bad it's not bad and here it says that it's the channel is actually making five dollars every month sometimes people actually put these figures there but the channel is not making any anything so you always need to verify but normally when you see that this pass is here this symbol with pass which means the seller is verified and you can always trust whatever words they put out there so we do have 40 $48 we do have $50 with 1140 subs we do have $49 with 1002 we do have so let's just go down and see which one will be best suits I mean the one that will suit our budget so when you go down when you go down I think so we click on number two we see what is still on the other page this one and this one so this one is actually stating that it's $179 with 1520 subs and it's making $50 every month sometimes it's also best that you check the type of niche that the channel is into most of the niche are gaming channels so it all depends on what you are actually planning to get the channel for so if you also want to follow a gaming then I think it's best you get a gaming page but if you are planning to get a gaming page then you should follow a gaming page but if you are not on top of the shorts lift it up a little bit and of course that is in place instead of the other one so here we are sweating for a comment here wow honey Idam Idam I mean so the first two videos that I'll be posting are going to be‰∏ç I mean, it's not enough. Normally, I prefer to buy a channel that got about 1,000 to an app. That is my personal preference. You might also have a different. I mean sometimes the sellers tend to boost. Most of the people who are actually selling here built the channel from scratch. So normally you might see that okay they're a bit of robots. Either way, it's still subscribers anyway. So once you login into the page, it says PikaTuka. I don't know what this is about. And it says 1,640 subs. It's still making $50 a month. And there are screenshots of the channel that the person is selling. So if you click here, you will see that okay it's already monetized. You can see that everything is active. It's got the shots that's already monetized. Even the watch hour, everything is intact. But here there is a green light here that says action watch. So you can see that it's already monetized. You can see that it's already required so i think it's something to do with the adsense account which is very minor i think the major problem that might turn you off will probably be when a channel got a warning when a channel has a warning that is a red flag but if the channel does not have any warnings and yeah claims at least you can deal with and any other minor stuff but when it's got a warning or a strike it's a problem like this channel that you are watching me on i recently got one strike so yeah it hurts but there's nothing i can do so more screenshots for you when you go in you can actually see that this channel is a fully monetized channel and it has already made some figures so far man you can see ten dollars here and yeah i think this channel is actually a decent channel to buy but for me with this price i feel like it's a bit too much for me you, because if i can dig in further i can maybe get two channels for this particular price yeah that's just an assumption so so you still get the links to the youtube channel and then you can click it it will take you straight to that particular channel so let's see what is the i'm not sure if you guys can hear the fan noise but if ever you guys can pick it up then i'm sorry because this machine is a bit old man so i just have to deal with it so yeah this is the channel here and it's indeed 1,600 subs and it's got 113 videos which is quite decent so this is a channel for kits, i'm not sure what they actually do but you can see it's got a lot of that and i can even see mr. Beast here so yeah this channel looks like a channel that it's making organic it's got organic rich it's got organic views and order if sometimes I also prefer to go to the about and check when the channel was main registered so this is December 2022 which is a bit suspicious but anyway I guess who even cares so sometimes I prefer to check the date even though it doesn't make a major difference but I always prefer when the channel is about five six months or year even more yes old I mean there are a lot of channels on the platform that you may see that is like two months they just created it two months one I mean one month ago it's a turn off for me because at the end of the day you'd recently created the channel and for you to get monetized that quick mmm for me I normally skip but I mean it's it doesn't make any difference but my personal preference I normally skip that so that is something that I think you can also watch out for it does not make any difference like I said but you can always watch out for that so this channel is a decent channel but I think the price is a bit too much once you actually see the channel and maybe you have an interest in the particular channel what you can basically do is maybe you can read to the description and find out whatever the person is telling you about it and maybe you can also check the posted so once you've seen the page and maybe you have an interest in it just try to read through the description and see if it's best suits what you are actually looking for so here is what you mainly need to check and as you guys can see it says that monetization enable yes so if the channel is not monetized you see no here and sometimes they can post everything you can go to the channel but this section is written no so this is somewhere that you always need to ensure that it's written yes if ever you are looking for a monetized channel if ever you have an interest or maybe you got some questions which are not actually listed in the description you can start a conversation with the seller you just send him a message and then you'll be like okay hey just be like hi is this channel really monetized blah blah blah when was it monetized you can ask all your questions right here so if maybe you do not have any questions you can just go back to the page where you saw the the ad and then you just have to click buy this channel so once you click on buy this channel it will give you a couple of payments options but before that there's things that you need to do and I'm very sorry if you guys can hear the funny background noise here if you click buy this channel it gives you these are the payment options that it gives you but before that you always need to check the description as well because some of the sellers do not accept certain payments so if you check here it says actually this guy got two is two or three yeah you got three payment options so you always need to check this whenever you are buying a channel you might end up clicking the buy option only to find out that this particular seller does not or I mean accepts the type of payment that you want to pay him what so once you are interested you click you put your email dress and then off you go you choose one of the payment what what then the whole process starts I'm still going to make it a little bit difficult but one of the things you need to do is start partnerrade kanji TV business cars you click degree Gel tho you are paying air visit golden island company on tv and 1974 to future video streaming an old movie you'll be Loving a viel of Agenda national tune that now you're going anywhere therefore cat.com youtube selfie di fazendo one who noticed you to leave a comma everything because unfortunately on surfaces call like movies plug in social media just like going to make a video about what to do when you get the channel i mean once you click on buy you don't just get the channel right away it takes about seven days for you to get the channel you have to go through their agent which is escrow and all that so there's quite a bit of process here which i'm going to do another video for i don't know why i'm actually sweating but anyway so uh there's quite a bit of process but i'm going to end this whole thing here because i don't want to make the video too long but that is it about acc market um there is just a whole bunch of sections that you can actually explore on this particular is it accs so i've been seeing acc all along there are different types of channel you do get from youtube instagram facebook and they are serious like you guys can like they are real time big people celebrities who are actually selling i mean it's it's it's fair enough because sometimes you might be broken need money and you don't have anything to sell you don't have anything to sell you don't have anything to sell you don't have anything to sell in an exchange for money you got an account why not you can sell it i mean imagine tunde ednaud's mr beast who is broke i mean you having some money financial crisis and you own billions of people on your platform and you know what your channel is worth i mean why set back you just have to post it and sell it i can assume how much people rush for mr beast's channel so just go through it check which one suits your needs better and this is a serious business that people are going to be interested in and i'm going to be doing a lot of research on this and i'm going to be doing a lot of research on this and i'm actually planning to venture into i think already i have bought about two channels so far yeah i have two channels so right away you guys these are the sales that has been going on so far which um i don't think it's right to show you guys others but yeah um business is ongoing and like i said there will be part two coming so if you're new on the channel like this video subscribe to the channel and there will be a whole lot coming so far so good if you have any questions based on accs market please let me know just listed in the comment section i'm not saying accs market is the only platform that sells or deals with this particular i mean types of accounts and all that you do get the whole different types of platform that sells accounts i mean there are a whole lot but i just can't remember but i'm actually familiar with this particular one so if you have any question this is where i have a developed experience this is where i've actually gained my experience from so if you have any questions based on this particular platform if you have any questions please let me know in the comments section i will answer all your questions if you want to buy if you want to sell if you are having problems here just let me know i will answer all your questions i know this is a bit off the type of content that i produce here but i mean it's still beneficial to content creators this is something that i wish i actually knew way before because if i actually knew that there is a way that you can buy a monetized channel way before trust me i wasn't going to build my channel from scratch i would have just bought a monetized channel and i would have just bought a monetized channel and i would have just bought a channel with about 6 000 subscribers 10 000 subscribers already monetized and start making money out of it and this is not to say buying channel is good or bad but i think it will all depend on what you actually need the channel for if you need genuine audience from the get-go you want to build a structure from start then it's best you build everything from scratch but if you are someone that you just need a channel on the get-go i mean the type of content that you produce you are definitely for sure that everything is going to work out once once you start everything i think it's always best you buy i mean buying it has been it has always been there and it's something that is always going to be i mean around so for me buying is an option i think it's a good idea just ensure that you take all the safety measures so you don't fall victim i mean victim of scammers there are also scammers here so you always need to be on the lookout so that is going to be it for now if you have any questions like i said drop it in the comment section like this video subscribe and i will see you guys in the next one thank you for coming peace",

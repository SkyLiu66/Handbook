    "data": " When you get an idea and you start turning the idea over in your head and inspecting it and trying to figure out what the strengths of the idea are and what the weaknesses of the idea are, a lot of the time that's when you start to figure out what medium the idea would work in best. When you get to comics, you have a whole different area of territory. We get to use the pictures and the words to try and do things inside the head of the reader that you might never be able to do in prose or in film. For example, why don't I take you through the process of plotting, a comic? And not just plotting a comic, but of taking an idea through to a script. Now, bear in mind that one of the strange things about writing comics is, as far as I can tell, there are probably as many ways to write a comic as there are people in history who have written comics. I do it my way. I'm sure everybody else does it my way. I'm sure everybody else does it their way. But I can give you how I do it and how I did it. Sandman 19. In Sandman 19, this is the first of the absolute Sandman volumes. It is huge. It is very heavy. You could use it to stun a burglar if necessary, which has always been my definition of art. I had been to a performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream. I'd loved it. I'd forgotten how funny it was. And it was an open-air theater. And there was something very strange and magical about being outside as the play began in daylight and moved into night. What would be interesting about Midsummer Night's Dream? How could I do this? I thought, well, look, the first performance of Midsummer Night's Dream, outside, with Shakespeare and Shakespeare's men, putting it on before an audience consisting of Oberon and Titania and Puck and the fairy creatures, who would all be a little bit more dark and dangerous than they are in the play, as a gift. And I thought, I like that. That feels like it's about something. And it also felt, dangerous. Felt odd. Nobody had ever done anything like that in a monthly comic. So then I reread the play, A Midsummer Night's Dream, just made notes, just put little pencil marks where I thought lines would be important, because I realized, of course, I was going to have to have various layers of action going on through the story. There would be the play always ticking. There would be the front row of the audience, which would be Morpheus, the Sandman, the Lord of Dreams, and Oberon and Titania and Puck. There would be the back row of the audience. I love the idea of just a bunch of idiot fairies commenting on the action and explaining it to each other. I thought, that'll be fun. And then I began. The way that you begin, if you're me is you take some paper. You take a bunch of sheets of paper, staple them together, fold them over, and I knew I had 24 pages. So I numbered one to 24. Actually all I needed to know, I didn't fill in very much in two pages. leftovers, took me to theANJамS πararijvrcyaan givanje, ne всяki tera Fabarak locutorek keni Щiçerenatui, st resultados next in comm Spider 감uments thhman aด this film pages bobings auzenтовivniENzast quetineniye explodesnotsing númikici Passover sifañi sy Butterf Имind�itus hwip amgiini, wich einst, dieário Reidni sīsnivaruio coworkers as badut ayrki. I didn't fill in very much detail in the middle. Normally, I'll fill in roughly what's happening on each page. But all I needed was starting and ending on this. I knew that everything else was going to be dictated by the pace of the play. So page one is traveling. Page two, meet the Sandman. Page three, set up Wendell, open the gate. Page four, the fairies are there. And that's my first notes to myself. So as I begin, I draw out roughly what is going to be in each panel. And I'm not doing this for any other reason than because what I want to do is know how big a panel, how much information I can ask an artist to put in a panel. You're not going to say, OK, this is a 12-panel page. And on page seven, I want the entire Plutonian space force coming in while down on the Earth we can see little Rodney and his dog running away. And his dog has got a flower. And you're going, no, you can't put all that information on a 12-panel page. You have a very small... You have a very small amount of information in each panel. The panel here is the unit of information. And they're small. So I begin by just roughing things out for myself. What you can see here is an ox pulling a wagon. And up on the hillside is the Long Man of Wilmington. And he's standing there and he's holding a stick. And I thought, what if it isn't a stick? What if he's a gatekeeper? What if he could open a door? And that's how the fairy folk come out of the hill. So that's already a visual for me, which means we're planting it there right from the get-go. So my little stick figures are instructions to me. They are only seen by me. If you do it like this, your thumbnails will only be seen by you. You don't ever have to show them to anybody else. You definitely don't have to show them to an artist who can actually draw. And the dialogue that I write down here is dialogue for me. But mostly what it does is tell me what the dialogue needs to do. It doesn't need to tell me what the words are. That's not what this is for. What this is for is breaking down the beats of the story for me. It's telling me that my method of storytelling, getting from one panel to the next with a story, making something that I can use to make a story, making something that somebody who can read comics can read as a story, is going to work. That's important. If I have an idea for what people need to be saying in a panel exactly, I'll note it down. But I will spend no time at all trying to get it exactly right. Because that's when you write the script. People ask how you write a comic script. And a comic script is much more complicated than a film script. In a film script, you just say what happens. And the director and the editor and the storyboard artists, the camera people, they're all going to decide how that is told. That's not up to me as the scriptwriter. And in fact, if I give them too much detail, they will probably say, well, I don't know. They will probably get grumpy. In comics, nobody gets grumpy. Because the function that you're performing as a writer of comics, of graphic novels, in film terms, you're the director, and you're the writer, and you're the editor. And the artist gets to be all of the actors, the director of photography, and the cameraman. And the production designer. And so together, you were a full team. And finished off by the letterer, who, in this context, I suppose, would be the sound person. And the colorist, who would, of course, be the grader. And now we're getting silly. So, for me, a script is a letter. When I'm writing a script, I'm writing a letter to the artist. I want to see them. You know, I've written a lot. want that letter to inspire them. I want that letter to infuse them. I want that letter to describe what we're doing and why we're doing it and what this is about. And I want to make them complicit in everything that we do. So fortunately, in this absolute Sandman volume one, the script is actually printed. So we begin with me just trying to set the scene for Charles Vass. I set the scene. I say hello. I describe some of the characters we're going to be meeting. The Sandman, very tall, very pale. If you like the goatee he had the last time we saw him in this time period, then keep it. I don't mind one way or the other. And a little note to the letterer. I said, Todd, this story is going to be lettering heavy. I know before starting. So if you can letter it slightly smaller, it's your normal practice. Thank you. Ready? Me neither. Here it goes. And we begin just with page one, panel one. So here I've got my little doodle to myself. And one of the things I know is I need more information in this panel. I could fit into a smaller panel. So it's across the whole of the top tier. And I describe it here. Long shot, large panel, the south downs on a late summer's afternoon, fine weather. In the background, small on a hillside, we can see the long man of Wilmington. He looks like he does now, except he's wearing a hat of some kind or the outline of a helmet. Originally, apparently, he had one. A white chalk figure outlined in a doorway cut into the turf on the side of Windover Hill. Coming toward us following a rough path in the turf trodden to mud is a procession of four rough wooden carts. One possibly drawn by huge Shire horses, none of your thoroughbred Arab steeds here. One possibly drawn by an ox or oxen. I've described this in a certain amount of detail here. You don't need to cram it all in. Just bear it in mind. So at this point, we get to page two, panel one. Long shot, Shakespeare has turned to the procession of people and carts, hand on his hips, shouting, hold fast, we stop here, my friends. Hamlet, go and wait with Condal and the other boys. But fast. Father. Page two, panel two. Shakespeare walking up the steep and grassy hill, probably from behind. He's sweating if we can see his face. No dialogue. Hamlet, his face slightly unreadable, but definitely not looking very happy, fills the panel. One of the things I love about comics is the silent panel. In prose, you cannot have a silent panel. You are talking. But in comics, you have to have a silent panel. And the audience, it is a silent panel. You get moments when nobody is saying anything. Everything is still, and they act as punctuation. They can act as a beat. They can act to underscore something. They make your audience, they make your reader contribute. They bring themselves to a silent panel. What are the people saying? What does this mean? How do they me that I'd put in there for him. Lines of things that are actually impossible to draw. Even, you know, his cloak is blowing in a non-existent wind. Tell your artist things that they can't draw, but they need to know. And you can describe all sorts of emotions, describe how people look, describe how they react, describe what they're thinking, because the artist knows. And that will, with luck, make it through into the pictures and into the story and into the world. The page for me in comics is a your unit. And it's a unit in a way that it isn't normally in prose. In prose, it doesn't really matter how something is paginated. And the reason that I sit here and I break everything down, the reason that all of what I'm doing here is to tell me what fits on a page, how it works on a page, when you're turning the page, when you're not turning the page, is so that you can see the page. Beat for beat. I'm in control and I go, good. The page is the unit. The panel in comics is a single illustration. You need another illustration next to it, another panel, in order to make it comics. It only starts to become comics at the moment where the reader begins to fill in between what happens in that panel and what happens in the next panel. And I think that's a good point. Sometimes you can use the page in an incredibly powerful way. You can surprise people. You can make somebody see something that they haven't seen before. For example, in Sandman number seven, probably the nearest thing to a classical superhero versus supervillain battle that there ever is in the entirety of Sandman, where Dr. D. This skeleton-headed, monstrous creature has the Sandman's ruby in which the Sandman's power is. And he says this is your life and I'm crushing it with my hands. And he crushes it and destroys it. And there's a huge explosion and we go over the page and now there's just a tiny figure against a completely different world. That's the story of the Sandman. Yeah, I think there's a whole whole story to it. Yeah, I think there's a whole whole story to it. It's a story. It's a story. There's a whole story. There's a whole story. There's a whole story. There's a whole story. Yeah. There's a whole story. white background. And we move in and we're still in this completely white background. And Dr. D says, I did it. I killed him. Whoever he was, whatever it was, it's dead. The ruby, the ruby's gone too. I feel so strange. He does a little speech about how I rule it. I'm the king of dreams of everything. It's funny. I always thought when I became king, I thought there would be applause. I thought somebody would say something. And he's standing there floating against this pure white background. And we go over the page. And we go over the page. And we realize that he is standing on the palm, the white, white palm of Morpheus, the Sandman's hand. And that's what we've been seeing. And Morpheus says, thank you, John D. And I'd forgotten how much of my power I'd placed in that ruby. And when you smashed it, it all came back. And it's a moment that I could not do. I could not pull that off without being in control of when the pages are turned. And actually, when we did the graphic novel version of this, we then had to create this one page where you get the tiny, tiny figure of Dr. D hanging in the air because we needed that page turn. That books and books and photos and all that was resistant to the comic books. So, aplicortunes now exist. The problem with comics is, you cannot put something important on a right-hand page. Or you can't put a plot surprise on a right-hand page, because people are gonna see it as they turn the page. They may not be looking at it. They may not be trying to see it, but they will kind of see it. So, if it's gonna be a surprise, if it's gonna have impact, put it on a left-hand page. Let people turn the page and find the thing. so there are there are geniuses in comics who write and draw and letter and color and do everything themselves uh people like chris ware who you look at or art spiegelman um they are brilliant i am not that brilliant so in order to create comics i need people who can do things and i have collaborators and we all work together we all work together to create something let's let's look at sandman 19 again it's a lovely example now the way that comics traditionally are done was it would be drawn out first of all in pencil and once penciled it would go to the letterer and the letterer in ink would letter draw the word balloons put the lettering inside them and then that would go back to the artist or go to a different artist to ink and inking is not coloring inking is the process of going over the pencil lines in black india ink in order to create something that is now reproducible shooting from pencils never really works because you lose a whole lot of detail so the first the most important collaborator on this uh which is charles vess and charles penciled and charles inked and fortunately we have some of charles beautiful pencils here and he uh part of the fun of charles's pencils is looking at how he looks at the text and how he looks at the text he studies the content which is your perfect picture so under the the optional feature the financial opportunity right and hinchfield Gracie gives us was an extraordinary aperitif especially for him because it we're using scabies they're exactly what we use on paintings we call them camesi and peter both just really everyone says that his work is bound up and it's really it's not in the text so there's no post- teleportations there's no post-transfere dot ing 일�ami on videos you just cut off his bigger drawing kind of picture so an artist and having much more design sense than I do, just told this little sequence. He puts one panel, smaller inset. We see Shakespeare and Hamlet walking ahead of the oxen. And Hamlet says, but father, you said that we will be performing the new play tonight. Where shall we play it if not in an inn? I have no idea, but we will know soon. Keep your eyes on the road ahead, lad, but father. And sooner or later, it would be colored in and would look like this. And then you do have another artist working on this page. In this case, it's an artist named Steve Oliff. And Steve colored this comic. And one of the things that he was doing was make everything darker as things went on. It starts on a glorious summer day. And he's working on a comic called The Dark Knight. And he's working on a comic called The Dark Knight. And he's working on a comic called The Dark Knight. And he's working on a comic called Summer's Day. It's going to head into dusk and then into darkness. And Steve Oliff's coloring was really elegant. He didn't work on Sandman for very long. But when he did, what he gave us was absolutely magic. It was lettered by Todd Klein. Todd is a glorious letterer. I think he now has won more awards for lettering than any other living human being. He won a lot of them through Sandman. And what was almost cruel of me was when I discovered everything that Todd could do, I'd make him do those things. So we got to the point where every member of Dream's family, of the Seven Endless, had a completely different lettering style. So many of the characters who turn up would have their own lettering style. I like the idea that you can kind of hear the lettering. In comics, you're having to do a sort of moment of synesthesia there. Any sound effect you see, whether it's a thwack or a plop, it's going to be written. And yet you're taking it as a sound. And that you need somebody like Todd to actually pull off for you. And then there are invisible collaborators. There's my editor, Karen Berger. And Karen was a fabulous, fabulous editor. She looked at the script. She normally didn't have much to say about the scripts because she liked them. Sandman 19, her reply to me was, I don't understand Shakespeare in particular. I'm not a big fan of Shakespeare. I'm not sure what the... heart of this story is? And I thought, right, okay. And I had to stop and think between my first draft on the script and my second, what was the heart? What was it really about? And you can call that theme, but really it's just, what's it about? What does it mean? Why is this story important? Theme at the end of the day is just, why should we care? Why should you care? And I had an editor whose opinion I trusted, loved, and respected, who was saying to me, why should I care about all of this? And I thought, well, actually, the heart of this story is Hamnet. It's this eight-year-old boy who I brought onto the stage, who's watching his father. Having this wonderful, successful career, but isn't really connected to him. Who's going to be seduced by Titania, and who dies a few years after. And who maybe I can, if I write it right, I can leave his death almost ambiguous, as if maybe he was taken away by the fairy. And I wrote a conversation. I took... I took one page. I only had really one page left to do things in. So I took that page, and I wrote a conversation where one of the actors who's playing Hermia says, you must be very proud of your father, Hamnet. Proud, I suppose. He's very distant, Tommy. He doesn't seem like he's really there anymore. Not really. It's like he's somewhere else. Anything that happens, he just makes stories out of it. I'm less real to him than any of the characters in his plays. Mother says he's changed in the last five years, but I don't remember him any other way. Judith, she's my twin sister. She once joked that if I died, he'd just write a play about it. Hamnet. Come on, laddie. I'm back on in a minute. Mother ordered him to have me for this summer. It's the first time I've seen him for more than a week at a time than I remember. But we live five days' ride from London up in Warwickshire and see him seldom. All that matters to him. All that matters. Is the stories. And the actor says, I would be proud of him if he were my father. And just that moment of heartbreak at the center of the story is what gives it its drive. It's why should you care? Because at the end of the day, you're seeing this beautiful, wonderful thing. The first ever performance of Midsummer Night's Dream, a play that has given joy to hundreds upon thousands of people. Probably to millions of people. One of the greatest beauties of the English language. And you're also watching the sorrow of a small boy whose father is out of reach, who isn't there. He's down in London making plays. And if he died, his father would just make a play about it and call it Hamnet. And that, that was Karen. That was Karen as a collaborator who is invisible. Just saying, why should I care about this story? And I thought about it. And that was what I gave her. And if there's a reason why it won the awards, it's not from the technical cleverness. It's not Charles Vess's beautiful drawings. It's not the wonderful Steve Olof colors. It's that moment where everything comes together, where Charles Vess draws, Steve Olof colors. Todd Klein. Todd Klein letters. That little six panel conversation. And we break everybody's heart.",

Theme accounts focus on a specific niche, such as food or children's books, and consistently post content related to that niche. This approach helps in building a dedicated audience interested in that particular topic. For example, a food blogger might only post recipes and cooking tips, ensuring that followers know exactly what to expect. On the other hand, IP accounts revolve around the individual behind the account. These accounts allow for more diverse content because the audience is interested in the person and their lifestyle. For instance, an influencer might post about skincare, fitness, and personal development, leveraging their personal brand to attract followers. Both types of accounts have their advantages and can be successful if managed correctly."

Vertical niches are highly specific and focus on a narrow topic, which can help in quickly building a loyal audience. For example, a vertical niche in the food category could be 'air fryer recipes,' where all content revolves around using an air fryer. This specificity can lead to higher engagement rates because the content is highly relevant to the audience. Broad niches, on the other hand, cover a wider range of topics within a general category. For instance, a broad niche in personal development might include content on time management, productivity tools, and self-improvement books. While broad niches allow for more content variety, they require a well-thought-out content strategy to ensure that the audience remains engaged. Balancing between these two approaches depends on the creator's goals and the audience's interests."

Presentation involves the visual and stylistic elements of the content, such as the use of specific fonts, colors, and layouts. For example, using the same font and color scheme for all posts can make the account look cohesive and professional. Even if the content varies, a consistent presentation style can make the account appear organized and reliable. This is particularly important for broad niches where the content topics might differ.

For example, a business offering culinary training should focus on posting repetitive yet informative content to attract new users rather than aiming for high follower counts. Additionally, businesses can utilize '代发' (proxy posting) services, where pre-written content is posted on multiple accounts to increase visibility. This approach allows businesses to scale their content efforts without significant additional resources. Moreover, Xiaohongshu's lower threshold for advertising compared to platforms like Douyin means that even accounts with a few hundred followers can secure advertisements, making it easier for businesses to monetize their presence.

Taobao, once a dominant player, has seen a decline in traffic and an increase in competition, making it difficult for new sellers to succeed. Pinduoduo, while popular, has stringent platform rules and a high rate of returns and refunds, which can significantly reduce profit margins. Additionally, Pinduoduo's low-profit margins and intense competition make it unsuitable for individual sellers without strong supply chains. Douyin, on the other hand, is preparing for an IPO and has introduced various paid features, making it challenging to gain organic traffic without significant investment. The high entry barriers and competitive environment on these platforms contrast sharply with Xiaohongshu's current state, where lower competition and a highly engaged user base provide a more favorable environment for new and existing e-commerce businesses. Understanding these challenges highlights why Xiaohongshu is a strategic choice for e-commerce ventures."

Unlike niche content, Vlogs can incorporate a wide range of products seamlessly into everyday scenes, making them versatile for various types of advertisements. For instance, a Vlog shot in a home setting can easily feature kitchenware, cosmetics, or even furniture without appearing out of place. Secondly, Vlogs enhance audience engagement by providing a glimpse into the creator's daily life, thereby satisfying viewers' curiosity and building a stronger connection. This personal touch can transform viewers from mere followers into loyal fans who are interested in the creator's life beyond their professional content. Thirdly, Vlogs require less stringent scripting compared to other content forms. The dynamic and visually engaging nature of Vlogs keeps viewers interested, even if the narrative is simple. Lastly, Vlogs do not necessarily require the creator to appear on camera, which lowers the barrier for those who are camera-shy or concerned about their appearance. By focusing on different scenes and activities, creators can produce compelling content without being the focal point."

A well-structured script includes details about the shooting locations, the sequence of scenes, and the specific actions to be captured. For example, if your Vlog is about a productive weekend, outline scenes such as waking up, making breakfast, and working on a project. Each scene should have a clear purpose and contribute to the overall narrative. Additionally, consider the visual elements of your Vlog. Use a variety of shots, including wide shots, close-ups, and medium shots, to keep the visual interest high. Quick transitions and dynamic camera angles can also help maintain viewer engagement. Furthermore, pay attention to the audio quality and background music, as these elements significantly impact the viewer's experience.

One common mistake is creating Vlogs that resemble a mundane diary, which can quickly bore viewers. Instead, focus on making each scene engaging and purposeful. Another mistake is allowing scenes to linger too long, which can test the viewer's patience. Aim for quick, dynamic cuts to keep the pace lively. Additionally, poor lighting and audio quality can detract from the viewer's experience. Invest in basic lighting equipment and ensure your audio is clear and free from background noise. Furthermore, avoid overloading your Vlog with too many different themes or topics. Stick to a central theme to maintain coherence and make it easier for viewers to follow. Lastly, neglecting to interact with your audience can make your Vlog feel impersonal. Encourage viewer interaction by asking questions, responding to comments, and incorporating viewer suggestions into future content. By avoiding these common pitfalls, you can create Vlogs that are both engaging and professional."

When you post high-collection articles, the system quickly recognizes your content and starts pushing it to relevant users. This is particularly important in the initial stages of account growth. The first few posts may not gain much traction, but as the system starts to understand your content, it will begin to push it to a more targeted audience. This delayed recognition often results in older posts suddenly gaining popularity. Therefore, it's crucial to consistently post high-collection articles to help the system accurately identify your niche and push your content to the right audience. This strategy ensures that your account grows steadily and attracts the right followers."

This involves giving a unique name to a product, which helps in distinguishing it from competitors and making it more memorable for consumers. For instance, in the beauty industry, brands often create catchy names for their products, such as 'SK-II's Little Light Bulb' for a whitening serum. This not only makes the product easier to remember but also conveys its primary benefit (whitening). The process of creating new terms involves understanding the product's unique features and benefits and then crafting a name that encapsulates these attributes. This name should be easy to remember, pronounce, and relate to the product's function. Additionally, it should evoke positive emotions or associations in the consumer's mind. By creating a unique term, brands can enhance their marketing efforts, improve brand recall, and foster a stronger connection with their target audience."

This strategy involves incorporating aspects of local culture, traditions, or beliefs into the product name. For example, in China, using terms related to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can resonate well with consumers. Products that include ingredients like ginseng or goji berries can be named in a way that highlights these culturally significant elements. This approach not only makes the product more appealing but also taps into the existing trust and familiarity that consumers have with these cultural elements. By aligning the product with cultural values and beliefs, brands can create a deeper emotional connection with their audience. This method is particularly effective in markets where cultural heritage plays a significant role in consumer behavior. It helps in differentiating the product and building a narrative that consumers can relate to, thereby enhancing brand credibility and loyalty."

To counter this, brands can create unique and memorable product names that continue to attract attention even after the initial buzz has faded. For example, a product named 'Little Black Dress' in the fashion industry can remain relevant and engaging for a longer period compared to a generic name. The key is to create a name that not only captures the essence of the product but also has a timeless appeal. This involves understanding the target audience and their preferences, and then crafting a name that resonates with them. Additionally, incorporating keywords and phrases that are likely to be searched by consumers can help in maintaining the product's visibility. By doing so, brands can ensure that their products continue to attract interest and engagement, thereby extending the lifespan of their content."

        "Content": "Pre-sale testing is a crucial step in validating your product's market demand before fully developing it. The core logic involves distinguishing between 'a priori' (pre-sale) and 'a posteriori' (post-sale) validation. 'A priori' validation occurs when you sell a product in a real payment scenario to verify if there is a market demand. If customers are willing to pay, it indicates that the product has potential. 'A posteriori' validation, on the other hand, involves assessing customer satisfaction and the likelihood of repeat purchases after they have experienced the product. The focus of pre-sale testing is on the former, ensuring that the product can be sold before investing heavily in its development. This approach aligns with the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) concept, where you first sell the product and then develop it based on the demand. The worst-case scenario in pre-sale testing is that the product doesn't sell, which is a low-cost failure compared to developing a full product that doesn't meet market needs. Therefore, pre-sale testing is an efficient and cost-effective way to validate your product idea."

For instance, if you are offering an English learning course, you need to identify whether your target audience is preschool children, elementary students, high school students, or adults. Each segment has distinct needs and preferences. Preschool children might need engaging, playful content, while adults might prefer structured, goal-oriented lessons. By defining your user personas, you can create more targeted marketing campaigns and develop products that resonate with your audience.

Essentially, it transforms video content into a graphic format where the images serve as the visuals and the text as the narration. For instance, a Plog might have a cover image with a title like 'Life Begins After Quitting My Job,' followed by a series of images with captions detailing the daily routine. The second type is the tool summary, which compiles useful tools or tips within a specific niche. Unlike Plog, the background here is usually a clean canvas with various pieces of information listed. An example could be '63 Apps Used by Top Content Creators,' where the cover image is a collage of app icons, and the inner pages provide detailed descriptions of each app. Both types have their unique advantages and can be tailored to suit different content strategies."

        "Content": "Creating graphic content on Xiaohongshu can be straightforward, but many creators fall into common pitfalls. One major mistake is producing content that looks sparse or lacks depth, often due to having only one or two inner pages. It's crucial to aim for at least eight pages to provide a comprehensive and engaging experience. Another common error is the lack of a cohesive aesthetic, such as inconsistent colors and fonts, which can make the content look unprofessional. Additionally, failing to develop a personal brand or IP by not including personal photos or unique elements can make the content blend in with countless others. Lastly, not conducting competitive analysis or market validation can lead to creating content that doesn't resonate with the audience. To avoid these mistakes, ensure your content is rich, visually cohesive, and personalized, and always validate your ideas through market research."

Then, use this Seed value in subsequent commands to ensure consistency. For example, if you want to change the color of a character's clothing while keeping the overall style the same, you can use the same Seed value with different descriptive keywords. This technique helps in creating a unified visual narrative across multiple images."

Top-down shots capture the product from above, side shots provide a dynamic perspective, and level shots are great for highlighting details. Use the grid lines on your camera to ensure proper composition, placing the product in the left upper quadrant, center, or lower left quadrant.

        "Content": "Selling on Xiaohongshu comes with its own set of challenges and requires specific strategies to succeed. One significant challenge is the high return rate for women's clothing, which can be around 40%. To mitigate this, sellers should focus on providing accurate product descriptions and high-quality images. Another challenge is the competitive nature of certain niches, such as beauty products and food items, which require proper certifications and quality assurance. To stand out, sellers should focus on unique, high-quality products and leverage user-generated content for authenticity. Additionally, seasonal products like sunscreen clothing or winter wear can be profitable due to lower competition. However, sellers should avoid niches with high competition and low market size, such as children's clothing, unless they can leverage strong distribution networks or partnerships with influencers. By focusing on these strategies, sellers can navigate the challenges and find success on Xiaohongshu."

Niches like green plants, socks, and seasonal clothing items such as sunscreen clothing or winter wear are less saturated and offer stable sales. For example, green plants are a small but stable niche, with consistent daily sales. Socks also have a low return rate, making them a reliable product category. Seasonal products, tailored to specific times of the year, can also be highly profitable. For instance, sunscreen clothing in summer or winter wear can attract significant attention due to their timely relevance. However, sellers should avoid niches with high competition and low market size, such as children's clothing, unless they have a robust strategy to differentiate themselves. By focusing on these less saturated and timely niches, sellers can achieve steady sales and reduce the risk of high return rates."

Avoid suppliers offering pre-sale items, as these indicate a lack of immediate stock. Prioritize suppliers who can ship within 48 hours to ensure timely delivery. Check the reviews carefully; a high number of positive reviews with minimal negative feedback is a good indicator of reliability.

        "Content": "Selecting products on Xiaohongshu involves two main strategies: intercepting traffic and leveraging low-follower viral posts. Intercepting traffic means identifying popular products and offering them at a slightly lower price. For example, if a competitor is selling a product for 199 yuan with a 50% profit margin, you can sell a similar product for 150 yuan with a lower profit margin. This strategy attracts more customers to your store by offering a better deal. The second strategy involves finding low-follower accounts that have created viral posts. These accounts often have only a few hundred followers but manage to generate thousands of sales. By identifying these products and sourcing them from platforms like 1688, you can capitalize on their popularity. Both strategies require careful observation and analysis of the market trends within Xiaohongshu."

        "Content": "A video script is essentially the design of the video’s shots, similar to a screenplay but for visual content. It includes details like the sequence of shots, angles, and the distance of the camera. The importance of a video script cannot be overstated. It directly influences the video's engagement metrics such as click-through rate (CTR), watch time, and interaction rates (likes, comments, shares). The first three seconds of a video, known as the 'golden three seconds,' are crucial. If these initial seconds fail to capture the viewer's attention, they are likely to scroll away. A well-crafted script ensures smooth transitions between shots, maintaining viewer interest throughout the video. High engagement rates lead to better algorithmic promotion on platforms like Xiaohongshu, increasing the video's reach and potential for conversions."

This could be an intriguing question, a surprising fact, or a visually striking scene. Next, each subsequent shot should seamlessly transition to maintain viewer interest. The script should outline the specific details to be shown in each shot, including angles, distances, and any necessary text or voiceover. Additionally, the script should plan for interactive elements that encourage viewers to like, comment, or share the video. For example, including a call-to-action (CTA) at strategic points can significantly boost engagement. By meticulously planning each aspect of the video, from the opening shot to the final CTA, you can create content that not only retains viewers but also encourages interaction and sharing."

This approach ensures that your audience receives value before encountering the advertisement, making them more receptive to your promotional message. The advertisement does not need to be unique every time; a well-crafted ad can be reused across multiple posts. This method leverages the trust and engagement built through valuable content to drive conversions.

The process starts with sourcing materials, which can be done in three ways: buying samples and photographing them yourself, using content from platforms like Taobao, or repurposing existing content from within the platform. The most recommended method is to buy samples and create original content, as originality is highly valued and reduces the risk of content being flagged as duplicate. If using existing content, ensure to modify it significantly to avoid issues with originality. For instance, you can mix and match segments from different videos or change the sequence of clips. This method, known as 'mixed editing,' allows you to create new content from existing materials. However, relying solely on repurposed content can lead to issues with content homogeneity and long-term sustainability.

Initially, mix single-product posts with collection posts. Collection posts, which showcase multiple items, have a higher chance of engaging viewers as they offer more variety and increase the likelihood of capturing interest. For example, a post featuring six to eight different clothing items is more likely to attract attention than a single-product post. This approach leverages the 'basket effect,' where the density of information increases the chances of viewer engagement. Additionally, reposting successful content can help maintain visibility and drive sales.

        "Content": "One of the key strategies for selecting products is to find those that have gone viral despite having low follower counts. This approach is particularly useful on platforms like Douyin (TikTok). Start by using a specialized software tool to search for products that have recently become popular. Focus on items that have high sales but are promoted by users with fewer followers. This indicates that the product itself has strong appeal and can sell well without the need for a large audience. Look for products that are primarily sold through short videos rather than live streams, as this method is more accessible for new sellers. By identifying low-follower viral products, you can find items that have a high potential for success with minimal initial investment."

These types of content may not directly bring in customers or conversions, but they help improve the account's rating and reduce the platform's scrutiny. For the first week, aim to post two pieces of high-engagement content daily without any promotional content. This establishes your account as trustworthy. As your account grows, expand your content to broader topics to attract a wider audience. For example, if you start with dessert-making tutorials, you can later include broader topics like culinary entrepreneurship. This helps to overcome the plateau in follower growth. When you notice a stagnation in engagement, it’s time to broaden your content scope. However, be cautious not to overextend to an audience that is too broad, as it may dilute your conversion rates."

This approach prevents a decline in your account’s visibility and ensures a steady flow of new followers. The key is to use traffic content to 'plant seeds' and conversion content to 'harvest' them.

Similarly, high-engagement cover images and content can be reused, but with some variations to avoid being flagged as duplicate content. For example, you can use the same title and cover image but change the subsequent images or slightly modify the content. This strategy allows you to efficiently produce content without constantly creating new material from scratch. Additionally, using different accounts to post similar content with slight variations can help you reach a broader audience without being penalized.

Fourth, consider products that are not easily identifiable in terms of cost.

One effective strategy is to encourage viewers to like, subscribe, share, and support the content. This can be done through clear and consistent calls to action (CTAs) in your videos or posts. For example, at the end of each video, remind your audience to 'like, subscribe, and share' if they enjoyed the content. Additionally, engaging with your audience through comments and social media interactions can foster a sense of community and loyalty. Responding to comments, asking for feedback, and creating content based on audience suggestions can make your viewers feel valued and more likely to support your channel.

Using these insights, creators can tailor their future content to better meet the preferences and interests of their audience. Additionally, analytics can help identify the best times to post content, the most effective CTAs, and the types of content that generate the most engagement.

        "Content": "Managing accounts that have been flagged for violations requires careful handling to avoid further issues. If an account is severely penalized or banned, it is advisable to stop using the associated device for new account registrations. This is because platforms can track the device's unique identifier, and using the same device for new accounts can lead to immediate restrictions. While some suggest that resetting the device or 'flashing' it can remove these identifiers, it is often safer to simply use a new device. Investing in inexpensive devices, such as budget Android phones, can be a cost-effective solution. This approach ensures that your new accounts are not linked to previously banned devices, thereby reducing the risk of immediate penalties. By taking these steps, you can protect your new accounts and maintain the integrity of your account matrix."

        "Content": "Optimizing account growth and content posting involves strategic planning and execution. Initially, focus on growing the account before applying for any official verification or certification. This approach ensures that you do not waste valuable verification opportunities on accounts that may not perform well. Once an account shows consistent engagement, such as several hundred views per post, you can proceed with verification. Additionally, it is important to manage the frequency of content posting. For accounts with fewer than 5,000 followers, posting two pieces of content per day is optimal. For accounts with more than 5,000 followers, you can increase the frequency to three posts per day. However, avoid overposting, as it can lead to reduced engagement. Lastly, to avoid penalties for redirecting traffic, use group chats or fan groups to share contact information rather than direct messages. This method reduces the risk of detection and ensures smoother operations. By following these guidelines, you can effectively grow your accounts and maintain high engagement levels."

Ordinary people should consider live streaming for several reasons. Firstly, live streaming provides a natural flow of traffic, which is essential for achieving sales. The platform's algorithm favors live content, giving it more visibility. Secondly, live streaming is an effective way to sell products. Unlike traditional posts, live streaming allows for real-time interaction with potential buyers, which can significantly increase conversion rates. Thirdly, live streaming helps build trust and rapport with the audience. When viewers see the person behind the brand, they are more likely to trust and purchase from them. Additionally, live streaming allows for immediate feedback and engagement, making it easier to address any concerns or questions from the audience. Overall, live streaming is a powerful tool for ordinary people to increase their sales, build a loyal customer base, and leverage the platform's traffic."

One common challenge is the fear of speaking live and not knowing what to say. To overcome this, it is essential to prepare a script or outline of the key points to cover during the live stream. Practicing beforehand can also help build confidence. Another challenge is attracting viewers to the live stream. Promoting the live stream through posts and stories a few hours before going live can help attract more viewers. Additionally, engaging with the audience by asking questions and encouraging comments can keep viewers interested and increase interaction. Technical issues such as poor lighting or sound quality can also be a problem. Investing in basic equipment like a good microphone and lighting can significantly improve the quality of the live stream. Lastly, consistency is key. Regularly scheduled live streams help build a routine for the audience, making them more likely to tune in. By addressing these challenges with preparation, promotion, and consistency, new live streamers can create engaging and successful live sessions."

A simple, well-lit space works best. Adding some personal touches, like branded items or relevant props, can make the environment more engaging. Lighting is another critical aspect. Natural light is ideal, but if that's not possible, use softbox lights or ring lights to ensure your face is well-lit and visible. Sound quality is equally important. A quiet environment and a good microphone can make a significant difference. Lastly, ensure a stable internet connection to avoid interruptions during the live stream.

The key is to be timely and relevant; if you jump on the trend too late, the impact will be diminished. For instance, if a popular TV show or event is trending, create content that ties into it while maintaining relevance to your niche. This approach helps attract a broader audience, which can then be filtered down to your specific target demographic.

However, avoid using third-party apps to create multiple instances as these are easily detected and can lead to account suspension.

This activity should be done in three steps: browsing, liking, and commenting.

Repeat this process for different keywords within your niche. The goal is to make your account appear active and engaged. After a few days, check your account's 'Discover' section.

        "Content": "When considering advertising on platforms like Xiaohongshu, it's crucial to understand that not all products are suitable for promotion. The primary factor to consider is the profit margin. Xiaohongshu's advertising tool, Juguang, is relatively simple compared to other platforms like Douyin's Qianchuan. It does not differentiate the cost of exposure based on the quality score, meaning the cost per exposure is the same regardless of the click-through rate. Therefore, if your product's profit margin is less than 30 yuan per sale, it is generally not advisable to invest in advertising on Xiaohongshu. The reason is that you will likely struggle to compete with products that have higher profit margins unless your click-through rate is exceptionally high. Additionally, products with a strong backend, such as those with high repeat purchase rates, can afford to have lower front-end profits. For example, weight loss products that lead to the sale of more expensive services can be advertised even if the initial product is sold at a loss. In summary, ensure your product has a sufficient profit margin before investing in advertising to avoid potential losses."

This strategy leverages Xiaohongshu's lower-cost traffic to drive sales on a more expensive platform. Lastly, if your goal is to achieve direct sales through Xiaohongshu's shopping cart feature, focus on content with high product click-through rates.

For example, if a product costs 40 yuan on 1688, set the price to around 100 yuan. Configure the shipping template to 'Non-remote areas free shipping' to attract more customers. Select your shipping address and ensure it is correctly set up. These steps ensure that your products are correctly priced and detailed, making them attractive to potential buyers."

Platforms like Douyin, Taobao, and others offer a variety of promotional options such as product seeding, customer acquisition, and different types of ads. These tools are structured in a way that encourages users to spend more money by offering multiple options and paths, similar to how supermarkets design their aisles to make you walk through more products. The key takeaway is to understand that the platform's goal is to increase its revenue, and not to get confused by the myriad of options. Instead, focus on the most effective and straightforward methods for your specific needs. For example, many products only require pay-per-click (PPC) advertising rather than a combination of multiple promotional tools. By understanding this, you can avoid unnecessary expenses and focus on the most efficient way to achieve your promotional goals."

For example, if you are promoting a watch, have comments that praise its appearance and quality. This creates a psychological effect where potential buyers feel more inclined to purchase. Second, use a variety of relevant keywords and hashtags to help the platform's algorithm understand your target audience. For instance, if you are promoting a gift item, include keywords like 'birthday gift,' 'gift for her,' and 'luxury watch.' This helps the system push your content to users who are likely to be interested in such products. Lastly, ensure your content aligns with the consumption scenarios of your target audience. For example, if you are selling mother-of-the-bride dresses, include keywords related to weddings and special occasions.

Use intelligent targeting to let the system optimize your ad delivery based on user interactions. Set a reasonable bid, such as one yuan per interaction, to control costs while maximizing reach. Additionally, focus on high-interaction content by selecting posts with high engagement rates for promotion. Avoid promoting content that has not performed well organically, as it is unlikely to do better with paid promotion. Regularly monitor your campaign performance and remove underperforming ads to focus your budget on the most effective ones.

The total number of viewers indicates how many people have watched your stream, even if only for a second. Concurrent viewers show how many people are actively watching at any given moment. High concurrent viewers often correlate with high total viewers, but not always. The quality of your content directly impacts concurrent viewers, as engaging content keeps viewers watching. Another important metric is the average watch time, which indicates how long viewers stay in your stream. Longer watch times generally lead to more traffic being pushed to your stream.

        "Content": "Optimizing your live stream content and engagement is essential for retaining viewers and driving interaction. Start by focusing on your stream's core metrics, such as the number of viewers and concurrent viewers. High concurrent viewers indicate engaging content, while the total number of viewers shows your stream's reach. To keep viewers engaged, ensure your content is valuable and relevant. Monitor the average watch time to gauge how long viewers stay in your stream. Longer watch times suggest that your content is holding viewers' attention. Interaction metrics, such as the number of interactions, orders, and order amounts, provide insights into how deeply viewers are engaging with your content. High interaction rates indicate that viewers find your content compelling enough to interact with or make purchases. Additionally, analyze the trend of online viewers to identify peak engagement times and adjust your streaming schedule accordingly. Understanding the sources of your traffic, such as recommendations or direct links, helps you optimize your promotional strategies. By continuously refining your content and engagement tactics based on these metrics, you can create a more engaging and successful live streaming experience."

        "Content": "Leveraging notes and understanding traffic sources are key to driving traffic to your live stream. Notes, or posts, play a significant role in attracting viewers to your stream. Regularly updating your notes with engaging content can help draw more viewers. For example, if a note receives a good number of likes shortly after posting, it can drive traffic to your live stream. It's important to synchronize your note updates with your live streaming schedule to maximize this effect. Traffic sources, such as recommendations, direct links, and notifications, also impact your stream's viewership. Recommendations and direct links bring in more targeted viewers who are likely to stay longer and engage more deeply. In contrast, traffic from general recommendations may result in shorter watch times as these viewers are less targeted. By analyzing the sources of your traffic, you can adjust your promotional strategies to attract more relevant viewers. For instance, if you notice that traffic from notes leads to longer watch times, focus on creating high-quality notes to drive more traffic. Understanding and leveraging these elements can help you build a more effective and engaging live streaming strategy."

During this phase, it's crucial to maintain a balance between promotional content and regular posts to avoid overwhelming the audience.

Another important rule is to avoid posting a large number of new terms in a short period. This can lead to your content being restricted. Instead, introduce new terms gradually to avoid detection by the platform's AI system. Additionally, do not directly copy images from other accounts. If you must use similar content, modify the images by changing the background or adding new elements. Xiaohongshu also tracks the location of devices, so using multiple devices in the same location can lead to restrictions. To avoid this, use different networks or VPNs to simulate different locations. Lastly, if an account is flagged for violations or restricted, it's best to delete it and start anew rather than trying to salvage it.

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu supports a no-inventory business model, which is ideal for new sellers. In this model, sellers list products on Xiaohongshu without holding any stock. When a customer places an order, the seller purchases the product from a supplier, such as 1688 or Pinduoduo, and has it shipped directly to the customer. This approach eliminates the need for upfront inventory investment and reduces the risk of unsold stock. Sellers can focus on marketing and customer service without worrying about warehousing and logistics. The profit comes from the difference between the supplier's price and the selling price on Xiaohongshu. This model is particularly beneficial for those with limited capital or those looking to test new products without significant financial commitment. By leveraging this model, sellers can efficiently manage their cash flow and scale their business based on demand."

A personal professional account is free and requires real-name verification using a personal ID. This type of account allows individuals to open a personal store and even help other influencers with their sales. On the other hand, an enterprise professional account requires an annual certification fee of 600 RMB and a business license. This account type does not need personal ID verification and allows one business license to open up to three stores. Enterprise accounts are ideal for those planning to manage multiple stores, as they can leverage the business license to open several accounts. Additionally, enterprise accounts can distribute their products through other influencers, making it easier to expand their reach. To open a professional account, navigate to the 'Creation Center' on Xiaohongshu and follow the steps to become a professional account holder."

If the product categories are limited, the store can be upgraded to an individual business store, which requires a business license and allows for more product categories. Ordinary enterprise stores also require a business license and can sell a wider range of products, but they have higher deposit requirements, ranging from 2000 to 50000 RMB. Specialty stores can sell multiple authorized brands, while flagship stores are for selling products under a single brand.

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu's platform fees are structured to support small and new businesses. If your monthly sales are less than 10,000 RMB, the platform does not charge any service fees. However, if your sales exceed this amount, a 5% service fee is applied to the excess. For example, if you sell 15,000 RMB worth of products in a month, the first 10,000 RMB is fee-free, and the remaining 5,000 RMB is subject to a 5% fee. Store names are also an important consideration. For personal stores, the store name is the same as the Xiaohongshu account name and can be changed every seven days. For enterprise stores, changing the store name involves re-submitting the business license and paying the 600 RMB certification fee again. Therefore, it's crucial to choose your store name carefully during the initial setup to avoid additional costs and administrative work later on."

By adding a weight parameter (e.g., IW=1.5), you can control the influence of the new element.

Start by sourcing these assets from reliable platforms like 1688, where you can find professional images and videos of your products. Save these files to your desktop for easy access. When creating a new listing, upload the main images first, ensuring they are clear and visually appealing. Videos can also be added to provide a more dynamic view of the product, showcasing its features and benefits. Ensure that the images and videos are relevant to the product and highlight its key attributes. For example, if you are listing a dress, include images that show different angles and close-ups of the fabric. Videos can demonstrate how the dress looks when worn, providing potential customers with a better understanding of the product. By using high-quality images and videos, you enhance the visual appeal of your listings, making them more attractive to potential buyers."

For example, comments like 'Where is your location?' or 'I want to learn this' can make the post appear more popular and engaging. This strategy helps attract genuine interest from potential customers. Additionally, if you are using a new account, it is crucial to boost initial exposure. Established accounts may naturally receive thousands of views, but new accounts might only get a few hundred. To overcome this, you can use promotional tools to increase visibility and measure the click-through rate (CTR). A low CTR indicates that the content may not be engaging enough, and adjustments are needed before investing in further promotion. By preparing in this manner, you ensure that your promotional efforts are more likely to succeed, attracting the right audience and generating meaningful engagement."

Monitor their performance and select the top-performing ones for further investment. Additionally, consider the timing of your ads. For instance, weekends might have higher costs compared to weekdays, so adjust your ad schedule accordingly. Another important factor is targeting. Use intelligent targeting options to let the system identify the most relevant audience for your ads. Avoid overly specific targeting, as it might limit your reach. Instead, rely on the system's algorithms to find the best matches. Finally, set a reasonable budget and monitor your ad spend closely. If an ad is not performing well, pause it and allocate the budget to better-performing ads. This continuous optimization helps in maximizing the return on investment for your ad campaigns."

For instance, information flow promotion is often more cost-effective and precise compared to full-site promotion, which includes search and video flow promotions. While full-site promotion covers a broader audience, it may not always be the most efficient choice for specific goals like lead generation. Instead, focusing on information flow promotion can yield better results by targeting a more relevant audience. Additionally, avoid using form submission promotions as they tend to have higher drop-off rates due to the cumbersome process of filling out forms. Instead, opt for direct messaging promotions, which are more straightforward and have lower barriers to engagement. By carefully selecting and focusing on the most effective promotion channels, you can ensure that your marketing efforts are both efficient and impactful, leading to better engagement and conversion rates."

To address low sales activity, one effective method is to use secondary accounts to make purchases. This involves preparing one or two secondary accounts to buy products from your store through Xiaohongshu's marketplace or by searching for notes. Ensure that these purchases are genuine, with actual shipping and confirmed receipt. This process helps increase the sales activity rate, which is crucial for improving the store's ranking and product visibility. The sales activity rate is calculated based on the number of products sold within a month. For example, if a store has 100 products and 80 of them are sold within a month, the sales activity rate is 80%. A higher sales activity rate leads to higher product weight and better visibility in search results. Therefore, maintaining a high sales activity rate is essential for the overall performance of your store."

To improve this rate, store owners can use secondary accounts to make initial purchases, ensuring that each product has at least one sale. This strategy helps boost the sales activity rate and, consequently, the store's ranking. Additionally, regularly monitoring and managing the product listings is essential. Products that have not sold within a month should be either deleted or re-listed as new items.

This process is akin to hiring a chef to create a dish from scratch rather than finding a pre-made meal. The 'G' in GPT stands for 'Generative,' indicating its ability to produce original content. This capability is powered by extensive pre-training on vast amounts of data, allowing the model to develop a deep understanding and generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. However, this generative nature also means that ChatGPT can sometimes produce inaccurate or fabricated information if the input data is insufficient or ambiguous. Therefore, while ChatGPT can be a powerful tool for content creation, it requires careful oversight and validation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the generated content."

For example, if you are selling a skincare product, your notes could describe the product, highlight its benefits, and encourage viewers to make a purchase. Additionally, you can use customer reviews from platforms like Taobao or Pinduoduo to create compelling notes. Copy and paste relevant reviews, ensuring they are genuine and positive. This method not only saves time but also provides social proof, which can enhance credibility and attract more buyers. By following these steps, you can create notes that effectively complement your posts and drive higher engagement and sales."

It is recommended to configure logistics settings on a computer for more comprehensive options. For instance, you may need to specify that shipments to Xinjiang and Tibet are not available, which is not a standard nationwide free shipping option and can be difficult to set up on a mobile device. Once you configure these settings on the computer, they will automatically apply to your mobile device, eliminating the need for further adjustments. This setup is independent of whether you have activated WeChat payment codes or not. Proper logistics setup ensures that your shipping policies are clear and helps avoid any potential issues with order fulfillment."

If you encounter issues such as using a different phone number for registration and payment, you may need to adjust your settings. For example, if your store account is registered with your phone number but the payment is linked to your spouse's phone number, you can resolve this by logging out of your spouse's Alipay account on your device and logging in with your own Alipay account. This way, you can ensure that all transactions are correctly linked to your account. It is also important to note that the phone number used for store registration does not need to match the phone number used for payment.

It is important to check whether the product is listed as 'on sale' or 'in the warehouse.' If the product is in the warehouse, you need to manually list it for sale. For orders with fewer than 30 items per day, you can manually process the orders by copying the customer's address and placing the order on platforms like 1688 or other suppliers. Ensure that you select the correct product specifications and shipping address. For larger volumes, consider integrating a system that automates the shipping process. Additionally, regularly check and update your product prices to ensure they are competitive and reflect the correct margins.

The platform thrives on 'appearance economy,' meaning that visually appealing products are more likely to attract clicks and sales. Products that are not visually appealing will struggle to gain traction. Additionally, Xiaohongshu is ideal for high-ticket items because the platform's high-quality traffic is relatively inexpensive. For example, acquiring a high-quality user on Xiaohongshu might cost only 20-30 yuan, compared to 150 yuan on Taobao. However, the platform's user base is mixed, similar to India's stark wealth disparity. Xiaohongshu has a significant number of high-quality users who have historically purchased high-ticket items like imported cosmetics and Dyson products. Therefore, products that are visually appealing and have a higher price point are more likely to succeed on Xiaohongshu."

Xiaohongshu's store traffic is almost negligible, accounting for only about 3% of the total traffic. Therefore, relying solely on store traffic for sales is not advisable. Instead, traffic should be driven through notes and live broadcasts. However, Xiaohongshu's live broadcast traffic is also limited and primarily dependent on notes and followers. Unlike Douyin, where live broadcasts can attract significant traffic, Xiaohongshu's live broadcast traffic is still in its infancy. Therefore, it is not recommended to set up a dedicated team for live broadcasts on Xiaohongshu at this stage. The primary source of traffic for Xiaohongshu's e-commerce is through notes, which can drive traffic to the store.

Another effective strategy is to use product seeding to boost the ranking of search keywords by increasing the number of likes and interactions. This method is particularly useful for products with high search demand. However, it is not recommended to use live broadcast promotion on Xiaohongshu due to its limited and imprecise traffic. Instead, focus on creating high-quality notes and using product seeding to drive traffic. Additionally, it is important to avoid overcomplicating the promotion settings.

Traditionally, users would browse products on Xiaohongshu but make purchases on other platforms like Taobao. By integrating shops, Xiaohongshu aims to retain users and increase its cash flow. No-inventory e-commerce, or 'no-stock' shops, means that sellers do not need to hold inventory. Instead, when a customer places an order, the seller forwards the order to a supplier who ships the product directly to the customer. This model is advantageous for individual sellers as it reduces the need for upfront investment and inventory management. It allows sellers to focus on marketing and customer service, making it easier to start and manage an online store."

This shift is driven by the need to increase user transactions directly on Xiaohongshu, rather than having users browse on Xiaohongshu and purchase on other platforms like Taobao. By encouraging in-platform transactions, Xiaohongshu aims to enhance its cash flow and compete more effectively with other e-commerce platforms. The introduction of Xiaohongshu shops has also led to increased visibility and traffic for posts that include product links. This means that posts with shop links are more likely to receive platform support and higher exposure. As a result, sellers who utilize Xiaohongshu shops can benefit from this increased visibility, making it an opportune time to leverage this feature. The platform's focus on supporting shop-linked posts indicates a strategic push to integrate shopping more seamlessly into the user experience, making Xiaohongshu shops an essential tool for sellers in 2024."

These accounts typically use product-centric content, such as photos and videos showcasing the product's features and benefits. The primary goal is to drive sales through product links and live broadcasts. In contrast, personal IP accounts emphasize the individual behind the account, creating a more personal and relatable connection with the audience. These accounts often feature lifestyle content, personal stories, and endorsements. The monetization strategy for personal IP accounts is primarily through advertising and brand collaborations, where the individual promotes products or services to their followers.

For example, a cover might feature a water bottle prominently in the center with a light, aesthetically pleasing background.

Therefore, it's crucial not to judge a post's success solely based on its performance within the first 48 hours. Additionally, Xiaohongshu has a precise search traffic system. If your post contains accurate keywords and high-interest topics, it can appear in search results long after it was initially posted, providing ongoing traffic.

Users generally have short attention spans, so speeding up the video to 1.2 to 1.4 times its original speed can make it more engaging. Next, add subtitles to make the content more accessible. Ensure the subtitles are placed in a visible area, preferably below your chin, to avoid being covered by other on-screen elements. Choose clear and readable fonts for the subtitles, avoiding overly stylized fonts that can be hard to read. Additionally, remove any unnecessary pauses or mistakes in the video to maintain a smooth flow. By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the engagement of your videos."

Users on Xiaohongshu are generally browsing for interesting content rather than searching for specific products.

The key to good lighting is to ensure that your face is well-lit while avoiding harsh shadows. One effective method is the 'two-point lighting' technique, where you place two lights at 45-degree angles from your face. This setup helps to evenly illuminate your face, reducing shadows and creating a more flattering look. Additionally, using softboxes or diffusers can help soften the light, making it more natural and less harsh. For background lighting, consider using accent lights to create depth and interest. These can be placed behind you to highlight the background and add a sense of dimension to your video.

For instance, if a scene transitions from holding an object to pressing a button, cut the video at that point. This segmentation helps in organizing the video and making precise edits. After segmenting, arrange your recorded clips in the same sequence. Initially, don't apply any effects; just ensure the clips are in order.

        "Content": "When a store receives an order, one common method to place orders is manually. First, copy the buyer's shipping information from the Xiaohongshu workbench. Then, open the procurement platform, such as 1688, and find the product link. Select the corresponding specifications based on the user's purchase and add a new shipping address by pasting the buyer's information. After making the payment, return to the Xiaohongshu order and note the procurement channel and order number in the store remarks. This helps in tracking the order's origin during the receipt process. The advantage of this method is that you can find sellers with shipping insurance, which covers return shipping costs even if you haven't activated shipping insurance. However, a downside is that if you purchase from Pinduoduo, the shipping label will indicate Pinduoduo, and from 1688, it will show 1688. Most sellers on these platforms do not offer shipping insurance. After the seller ships the product, copy the tracking number and paste it into the Xiaohongshu order, ensuring the courier company matches the seller's to avoid logistics information issues and potential complaints."

Once the plugin is installed, you can see which orders need to be placed and shipped. Copy and paste the supplier's product link to place the order. The benefit of using this tool is that it automates the shipping process. Once the supplier ships the product, you can click 'Auto Ship,' and the order will be synchronized with the supplier's shipment, eliminating the need to manually copy and paste tracking numbers for each order.

The first method involves modifying your material using editing software like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro to make it appear original. This includes changing aspects such as angles, lighting, and other visual elements. The second method is creating 'pseudo-original' content. This involves replicating the style and format of successful posts but shooting the material yourself. By doing so, you avoid directly copying others' work, which can lead to violations. It's crucial to understand that while these methods can help in the short term, the platform strongly supports original content.

First, separate the audio from the video by selecting the video clip and choosing the 'Audio Separation' option. This allows you to use the audio independently of the original video. Next, mute the original video to focus solely on the audio. You can then replace the video segments while keeping the popular audio intact. For example, if the original video shows unboxing a product, you can replace it with your own footage of unboxing while retaining the audio. Ensure that your new video clips match the audio in terms of timing and context. This method helps in leveraging popular audio to enhance the appeal of your content while maintaining originality in the visuals."

If customers receive such items, they may realize the product is from Pinduoduo and request a refund or leave negative feedback. Always communicate with the supplier to ensure 'no-trace' shipping, meaning no Pinduoduo branding or promotional materials are included. If a supplier cannot guarantee this, find another who can. This practice helps maintain a high order completion rate and positive reviews, which are essential for the growth and reputation of your store."

This seamless integration within the app makes it convenient for users to make purchases. However, it is important to note that Xiaohongshu's e-commerce competitiveness is relatively weak compared to platforms like Taobao or JD.com.

On the other hand, high-barrier products, which are difficult for most people to sell, can also be considered, though they are less recommended. Examples include luxury second-hand items. Additionally, lead products, which are used to attract customers and encourage them to promote your products further, play a significant role. For instance, offering a deal like '5 kg of fruit for $9.99' with the condition that the customer shares a post on Xiaohongshu can help generate more traffic. Lastly, profit products and distribution mechanisms are essential.

Regularly posting high-quality content that resonates with your audience is key. This content should not only promote your products but also provide value to your followers, such as tips, tutorials, or behind-the-scenes looks at your business. Engaging with your audience through comments, direct messages, and interactive posts helps build a loyal community. Additionally, using secondary accounts to boost engagement and manage negative feedback can maintain a positive image. For instance, if a post receives negative comments, you can use your authority as the author to delete these comments and block the users if necessary. This proactive approach ensures that your account remains a trusted source of information and products, encouraging more users to follow and engage with your content."

Additionally, implementing a distribution mechanism where you sell products at a lower price to distributors who then resell them at a higher price can expand your reach. This creates a network of sellers who help promote your products. Furthermore, maintaining consistent communication with your audience through platforms like WeChat is crucial. This includes responding to customer inquiries promptly, providing personalized recommendations, and sharing exclusive offers. By building a strong relationship with your audience, you can increase customer loyalty and drive more sales.

The key is to understand the difference between single-product and multi-product strategies. For single-product strategies, it's essential to post at least 20 notes for each product to ensure visibility and potential sales. Posting just one note is unlikely to generate significant results. For multi-product strategies, you can either focus on creating a 'hot item' by posting about it multiple times daily or diversify by posting about 2-5 different products each day. Regardless of the strategy, it's important not to exceed five notes per day in the early stages of your store's development. This is because Xiaohongshu's algorithms and rules are constantly evolving, and overposting can negatively impact your account. Once your store starts generating consistent sales, you can gradually increase the number of notes posted daily.

Creating a note involves several stages: finding a topic, scripting, shooting the video, and publishing. This process can take three to four days or even longer, especially for ad-related notes due to high communication costs. To overcome this time constraint, use a successful template repeatedly. For instance, a template that has previously gone viral can be reused for different advertisers. This approach ensures that each note can generate revenue multiple times. Additionally, after publishing an ad note, you can remove the ad content and republish it as a regular note. This way, the same content can be monetized multiple times, maximizing its commercial value.

For instance, if you publish too many ad notes without enough regular content, platforms like Xiaohongshu may downgrade your account's ranking. This downgrade can reduce your visibility and limit your ability to monetize effectively. To maintain this balance, plan your content calendar to include both ad and regular notes. If you find it challenging to produce enough regular content, consider creating soft ads that blend seamlessly with your regular posts.

If you are not familiar with design tools like Photoshop (PS), there are other user-friendly options available such as TuGuaiShou, ChuangKeTie, and MeiTuXiuXiu. These tools offer templates and easy-to-use features that can help you create professional-looking covers. For instance, ChuangKeTie is recommended for its versatility and ease of use. When designing a cover, consider the color scheme based on your target audience. For female-oriented products, use lighter colors, while for male-oriented products, darker colors like black are more suitable. Additionally, include compelling text that resonates with your target audience. For example, if you are promoting a weight loss product, a phrase like 'This method has helped ten thousand people lose weight' can be very effective. By investing a little time and effort into creating an attractive cover, you can make your content more appealing and increase your chances of success on Xiaohongshu."

If the content receives less than 50 views within the first five minutes or less than 200 views within a day, it is likely that the account is restricted. In such cases, it is advisable to create a new account. If the old account is in good standing, you should remove any unrelated content to maintain the account's purity and focus.

It involves targeting customers who have already shown interest in your restaurant by visiting your website or starting an order but did not complete the purchase. By using a Facebook pixel on your online ordering site, you can collect information on these visitors and target them with ads on Instagram and Facebook. This method is cost-effective and ensures that your ads reach people who are already familiar with your restaurant and are more likely to convert. For example, if a customer named Sally almost placed an order but got distracted, retargeting allows you to remind her of the dish she was interested in, increasing the chances of her completing the order later. This strategy is more efficient than trying to attract entirely new customers and can significantly boost your sales with a lower ad spend."

For instance, Talk & Tacos in Miramar, Florida, effectively uses their profile to highlight their halal Mexican food, their most popular dish, and a local partnership. They also use story highlights to answer common questions, such as operating hours and popular menu items. These highlights act like a movie trailer, showcasing the best aspects of your restaurant and guiding potential customers on what to expect.

Here, you can create multiple addresses for shipping and returns. For shipping addresses, you can use your own address or any other address, especially if you are dropshipping. The return address setup is more critical, particularly if you are dealing with multiple suppliers. You can create a strategy for multi-address returns, allowing you to set specific return addresses for different products. For example, if you are selling earrings from different suppliers, you can set unique return addresses for each supplier. This ensures that returns are sent directly to the respective suppliers, simplifying the return process and avoiding the hassle of handling returns yourself. Properly setting up these addresses will streamline your logistics and improve customer satisfaction."

Start by setting up a shipping template that offers free shipping to non-remote areas. This can be done by editing the template to exclude remote areas like Xinjiang and Tibet, where shipping costs are significantly higher. By doing so, you ensure that your shipping costs do not exceed your product's profit margin. Additionally, consider using service labels such as 'Freight Insurance,' 'Rapid Refund,' and 'Deposit Service.' These labels can enhance your store's visibility and credibility. 'Freight Insurance' covers the return shipping cost for customers, reducing disputes. 'Rapid Refund' allows quick refunds for orders under a certain amount if they are canceled before shipping. 'Deposit Service' involves paying a deposit to the platform, which can increase your store's traffic and conversion rates. Implementing these templates and labels will improve your store's logistics efficiency and customer trust."

After registering your store, make sure to activate these payment methods to avoid any issues with order processing and withdrawals. Next, configure sub-accounts if your store is managed by multiple people. This can be done in the 'Store Management' section under 'Sub-Account Settings.' Sub-accounts allow you to assign specific roles, such as customer service, operations, or finance, to different team members. Each sub-account can have limited access based on their responsibilities, ensuring that sensitive information is protected. For example, a customer service sub-account can only handle customer inquiries without accessing sales data. Properly setting up payment and sub-accounts will streamline your store's management and enhance security."

A well-structured script is essential for maintaining a logical flow and ensuring that your video is coherent and engaging. Use storyboards to plan each scene, including the content, composition, and duration. This helps in visualizing the final product and ensures that all necessary elements are included. Once the script is ready, proceed to shooting. Pay attention to lighting, camera angles, and sound quality to enhance the overall production value. After shooting, move on to editing.

Proper lighting ensures that your photos are well-exposed, highlighting the details and colors of the subject. To achieve optimal lighting, you need to understand both the intensity and direction of light. For instance, using front lighting (or 'key light') can enhance the clarity and brightness of your subject, making it ideal for capturing faceted gemstones like diamonds and sapphires. Conversely, side lighting can create a dramatic effect by casting shadows, which is perfect for capturing the texture and depth of smooth-surfaced gemstones like jade and pearls. Additionally, controlling the quality of light—whether it's soft or hard—can further refine your images. Soft light, which can be achieved using diffusers or shooting on cloudy days, produces gentle shadows and a more flattering look. Hard light, on the other hand, creates sharp shadows and is excellent for adding contrast and drama to your photos. By mastering these lighting techniques, you can significantly improve the visual appeal and professional quality of your photography."

This technique helps in creating a balanced and engaging photo. Another important aspect of composition is the use of leading lines, which guide the viewer's eye towards the main subject. These lines can be natural elements like roads or rivers, or man-made structures like fences or bridges. Additionally, framing your subject using natural elements like trees or windows can add depth and context to your photos. It's also essential to consider the angle from which you shoot. Different angles can convey different emotions and perspectives. For instance, shooting from a low angle can make your subject appear more powerful, while a high angle can make it seem more vulnerable.

One basic principle is to use complementary colors, which are opposite each other on the color wheel, such as red and green or blue and orange. These combinations create a vibrant and dynamic look. Another approach is to use analogous colors, which are next to each other on the color wheel, like blue and green or red and orange. This creates a more harmonious and soothing effect. Additionally, consider the emotional impact of colors. Warm colors like red, orange, and yellow can evoke feelings of warmth and excitement, while cool colors like blue, green, and purple can create a calm and serene atmosphere.

This can make the video more dynamic and engaging. Additionally, use the 'Mirror' and 'Zoom' tools to alter the appearance of each clip slightly. Mirroring flips the video horizontally, while zooming in or out changes the focus area. These subtle changes can help avoid detection by content algorithms that flag duplicate content. Another useful technique is to adjust the video's angle slightly using the 'Tilt' tool. This makes the video look unique and can prevent it from being flagged as copied content.

Each clip should be adjusted individually, either by enlarging and rotating or by applying a mirror effect. This process ensures that the video looks polished and professional.

The most important adjustment is sharpening, which should be set between twenty to thirty points to make the details stand out. Additionally, adding grain can give the video a textured look, which should also be set between twenty to thirty points. While other adjustments like color temperature and tint can be made, they are not as critical. If you choose to use filters, apply them sparingly to avoid overpowering the video. A subtle filter like 'Dracula' at around ten percent can add a professional touch without being too noticeable.

If your clips are longer, you can extend the transition duration slightly. Overlays, such as stickers or text, should be added to enhance the video. Place stickers in the four corners of the frame and reduce their size to make them almost invisible. For text overlays, use keyframes to animate the text, making it move slightly to keep the viewer's attention. Ensure that the text is set to a low opacity, around one to two percent, so it doesn't dominate the screen.

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu has implemented a policy against no-stock drop shipping to maintain the quality and integrity of its e-commerce platform. This policy was introduced in August to curb unregulated practices that were prevalent during the platform's early growth phase. Initially, Xiaohongshu, like other e-commerce platforms such as Taobao and Pinduoduo, allowed various practices to attract merchants. However, as the platform matured, it became necessary to enforce stricter regulations to ensure sustainable growth. The no-stock drop shipping policy specifically targets merchants who do not hold inventory and instead place orders on other platforms like Taobao or 1688 using customer details. This practice often leads to customer complaints and logistical inconsistencies, which the platform aims to eliminate. Merchants must understand and adapt to these changes to continue thriving on Xiaohongshu. By aligning with the platform's policies, merchants can ensure their long-term success and avoid penalties such as account suspension or restrictions on listing new products."

        ],
        "Content": "There are three primary factors that can lead to violations of Xiaohongshu's no-stock drop shipping policy. First, user complaints and reports play a significant role. If customers receive messages or electronic waybills indicating that their orders were placed on other platforms like Taobao or Pinduoduo, they may report the merchant. Such reports can result in the merchant's account being flagged for no-stock drop shipping. Second, the platform uses a big data model to identify suspicious activities. If a merchant's shipping locations exceed three different addresses within a month, the system may flag the account. This is determined based on the actual logistics information of each order, not the addresses entered in the platform's settings. Therefore, merchants should work with a consistent set of suppliers or use centralized warehousing solutions to avoid frequent changes in shipping locations. Third, external public opinion can also influence the platform's decisions. If a particular product receives numerous negative reviews or if multiple merchants use the same supplier, the platform may take action. Merchants should strive to maintain high-quality products and services to avoid such issues."

The platform's policies are dynamic and change in response to market conditions and user feedback. Merchants must stay informed about these changes and adjust their strategies accordingly. For instance, with the introduction of the no-stock drop shipping policy, merchants need to ensure they hold inventory or work with reliable suppliers who can provide consistent shipping locations. Additionally, maintaining a positive customer experience is essential. This includes timely order fulfillment, high-quality products, and responsive customer service. Merchants should also monitor their logistics data and avoid practices that could trigger the platform's big data model to flag their account. By being proactive and flexible, merchants can navigate the platform's regulatory landscape effectively. Understanding and complying with Xiaohongshu's policies not only helps in avoiding penalties but also builds trust with customers, leading to long-term business success."

These systems typically include software and hardware components such as shipping label printers. The primary function of these systems is to streamline the order fulfillment process by automating the printing of shipping labels and other necessary documentation. This automation reduces manual errors and speeds up the order processing time. To integrate with a manufacturer's order printing system, you need to use compatible software that can synchronize orders from multiple platforms. One such software is 'Dian Guan Jia,' which allows you to bind multiple stores to a single platform and synchronize orders seamlessly. The setup involves registering an account, binding the manufacturer and store, and linking products to the manufacturer. This integration is particularly beneficial when dealing with a high volume of orders, as it simplifies the process for both the manufacturer and the seller. By understanding and utilizing these systems, businesses can enhance their operational efficiency and ensure timely order fulfillment."

In the early stages of your business, when order volumes are relatively low, it may be more practical to communicate directly with the store or manufacturer without using an automated system. However, as your business grows and the number of orders increases, the manual process can become cumbersome and prone to errors. At this point, integrating with a manufacturer order printing system becomes advantageous. These systems automate the printing of shipping labels and other necessary documentation, significantly reducing the time and effort required to process each order. Additionally, they help in maintaining accuracy and consistency in order fulfillment. By using such systems, you can focus more on other aspects of your business, such as marketing and customer service, while ensuring that orders are processed efficiently. Therefore, it is advisable to consider using manufacturer order printing systems when your order volume reaches a level where manual processing is no longer feasible."

Trending topics involve leveraging current events, celebrity news, or seasonal trends to attract attention. For example, associating content with a popular celebrity or a recent event can significantly boost visibility. Compilations, on the other hand, involve creating lists or collections of related items, such as recommended apps, books, or products. These types of posts are particularly effective because they provide value to the audience by offering curated recommendations. In the early stages of account growth, it is advisable to focus heavily on traffic-generating content, which can constitute up to 80-90% of your posts.

A reflector helps bounce light onto the subject, reducing shadows and creating a more even lighting effect. Fill lights, such as light sticks, provide additional illumination, ensuring that the glass bottle is well-lit from all sides. When setting up, place the reflector opposite the main light source and use fill lights to eliminate any remaining dark spots. This setup not only makes the glass bottle appear more transparent but also adds depth and dimension to the photo. By carefully arranging these tools, you can achieve a professional look that highlights the glass bottle's texture and clarity."

        "Content": "Lighting is one of the most challenging aspects of shooting jewelry videos. Jewelry, with its reflective surfaces and intricate details, can easily suffer from overexposure or poor lighting, resulting in a lackluster appearance. To address this, it is crucial to use a well-thought-out lighting setup. A common approach involves using a spotlight from above, with reflective boards on either side and a piece of tracing paper in the middle to diffuse the light. This setup helps in achieving a balanced and high-quality look. Overexposure is a frequent issue, and it can make even minor scratches on the jewelry visible, degrading the overall quality of the video. By using this method, you can minimize overexposure and capture the jewelry's true essence. Experimenting with different backgrounds and lighting angles can also enhance the video's quality, making the jewelry appear more appealing and professional."

This technique reduces harsh shadows and highlights the jewelry's details, giving it a 'bling' effect. Additionally, using a U-shaped setup with a mirror and spotlight can create a soft, diffused light that enhances the jewelry's appearance. This method ensures that the jewelry is well-lit from all sides, making it look more vibrant and attractive.

        "Content": "Including copy in your posts depends on the type of content you are sharing. If you are posting video content, the copy can be minimal or even omitted because the primary information is conveyed through the video and its audio. However, if you are posting images or text-based content, it is essential to include a well-crafted copy. A simple title with a few hashtags is not sufficient. The copy should provide additional context, engage the audience, and encourage interaction. For posts that are meant to drive conversions, such as those promoting a product, the copy becomes even more crucial. If your post is getting good views and likes but not converting, it indicates that the copy is not compelling enough to push the audience to take action. In such cases, revising the copy to include a strong call-to-action can significantly improve conversion rates."

This copied text can be pasted into your notes or sent to yourself via a messaging app for further editing. This method is also useful for copying long comments or reviews from platforms like Taobao.

Start by logging into Xiaohongshu and selecting the e-commerce section. After enabling the distribution capability, navigate to the Influencer Plaza to find influencers that match your product category. For instance, if you sell beauty products, filter influencers by the beauty category. Before initiating a collaboration, analyze the influencer's audience demographics to ensure they align with your target market. For example, if you sell baby products, an influencer with an audience aged 18-24 may not be ideal. Additionally, evaluate the influencer's live streaming capabilities by reviewing their average live stream data and sales performance. Look for influencers who have consistent live streaming schedules, high viewer engagement, and substantial sales figures. Once you find a suitable influencer whose audience and performance metrics align with your product, you can send a collaboration invitation."

The number of followers alone does not determine an influencer's effectiveness in driving sales. Instead, analyze their live streaming data, including the frequency and duration of their streams, as well as their sales performance. For example, an influencer who streams regularly for an average of three hours and generates significant sales (e.g., $20,000 to $50,000) is likely to be a good candidate. Conversely, if an influencer streams infrequently, for less than two hours, and has low sales figures, they may not be worth collaborating with. Additionally, consider the alignment of their previous collaborations with your product category. An influencer who has successfully promoted similar products and has an audience that matches your target demographic is more likely to drive effective results. By thoroughly evaluating these factors, you can identify influencers with strong live streaming capabilities and a high potential for successful product promotion."

Third, your store's operational status must be normal, without any violations or issues. If you meet these criteria, you can activate the distribution capability and start collaborating with influencers. However, if you do not currently meet these requirements, you can still reach out to influencers directly through their profile contact information, such as their collaboration email. Avoid sending private messages asking for collaboration or sharing your contact details, as this can lead to your messaging function being disabled or even account suspension.

Opening a store is accessible with just an ID, allowing individuals to sell products. Local life services, similar to group buying and beauty services, are currently in beta testing in major cities. Knowledge-based courses involve selling skills or expertise, often through live streaming. Live streaming allows for direct product sales and can be done without a follower threshold. Private domain monetization involves using Xiaohongshu to attract customers and then converting them in a private domain, useful for high-consideration purchases like home renovation."

By altering the MD5 hash of an image, you can effectively change its identity, making it appear as a different image to detection systems. This process involves using MD5 software to generate a new hash for the image. First, gather the images you want to modify and save them in a folder. Then, use the MD5 software to alter the hash of each image. This can be done individually or in batches. Once the MD5 hash is modified, the image will have a new identity, and systems that rely on MD5 hashes for detection will not recognize it as a duplicate or stolen image. This technique is particularly useful for ensuring that your images are not flagged as duplicates when uploading to various platforms. However, it's important to use this method ethically and not for infringing on others' intellectual property."

After the modification, save the images with their new MD5 hashes in a separate folder.

First, you need to determine the form of monetization you aim for, whether it's selling products, promoting items (known as 'planting grass'), or business monetization through advertisements. For beginners, focusing on selling products is advisable as it is the most straightforward method. Once the monetization form is clear, the next step is to accumulate good copywriting examples. Study and mimic successful copywriting to improve your own skills. Initially, you can imitate others, but gradually move towards creating original content. This approach is similar to video creation, where you start by mimicking and then move to original content. Finally, innovate new copywriting styles. This systematic approach ensures that your content is engaging and effective, ultimately leading to better monetization."

For example, you might trim the first and last 1.5 seconds to remove any unnecessary content. These tasks can be automated to save time and ensure precision. Tools that offer these features often come with additional functionalities like background blurring and text overlay, which can further enhance the video.

First, import the downloaded video and change its aspect ratio to 3:4. This can be done by selecting the 'Aspect Ratio' option and choosing 3:4. Next, you may need to crop the video to ensure it fits well within the new aspect ratio. Pay attention to the framing to make sure the main subject of the video remains in focus.

This allows you to rearrange the segments to create a new narrative flow. For example, you can take a 12-second video and cut it into 3-4 segments, then rearrange these segments to create a different sequence. Another advanced technique is content replacement. You can replace certain segments of the video with new material from other videos. This is particularly useful if you find multiple videos of the same product but with different angles or features. After replacing the segments, ensure that the aspect ratio and framing are consistent with the rest of the video. Additionally, separate the audio from the video and mute the original audio if necessary to avoid overlapping sounds.

The CTR, which is the ratio of users who click on your post to those who see it, is akin to the 'watch-through rate' on Douyin. If your post achieves a high CTR, Xiaohongshu will push it to more users. Therefore, creating an eye-catching cover and a compelling title is essential. These elements are the first things users see and significantly influence their decision to click. Common strategies to improve CTR include using visually appealing images and clear, concise titles that promise valuable content.

Once users click on your post, the next step is to engage them enough to like, save, or comment. Each of these actions signals to the platform that your content is valuable. Saves are particularly important because they indicate that users find your content useful and want to refer back to it later. This is often the case with 'dry goods' content, which provides practical tips or valuable information. Comments are also highly valuable as they increase user interaction time, which is a key metric for all social media platforms. Encouraging comments can be achieved by asking questions, prompting users to share their experiences, or creating content that elicits strong opinions.

Additionally, inquire if the supplier has a 1688 store, as orders from 1688 typically do not include fulfillment notifications. Another approach is to purchase a product from the supplier and initiate a return to obtain the contact details of the warehouse or store manager.

The third method is to drive transactions through private domains. This involves moving potential customers to private channels where you can engage with them directly. While this method can be more sustainable in the long run, it also carries the risk of being restricted or banned by the platform if not done correctly.

What we're doing is we're shooting what the viewer will experience in their mind. So that's kind of we're going to get a little bit on the theory side here but I want to keep it very straightforward for you guys. But basically is this is that the type of footage or the type of video that you watch is always made up of two different types of coverage. That's a-roll coverage which is the main footage of your video. This is a-roll coverage right now. It's me talking. It's your main layer of footage. I said that twice or three times. It's your main layer of video in your video right. That's called a-roll. Now b-roll is basically the cutaway shots or b-roll is basically the cutaway shots or b-roll is basically the cutaway shots or b-roll is basically the cutaway shots or b-roll. So this is exactly what I'm talking about here. Now we want to be able to show you what is added on to that layer of video to further explain. So I've mentioned that before. And basically its primary in secondary footage and the reason I say that it's what the view or experience in their mind if I'm talking to you right now. This and you're watching this video this is all your experiencing. Now if I took it a step further and added cutaway shots or you journey and a different experience in your mind which would then create a better looking and feeling more produced video. So that's really the primary thing that we're talking about here. So let's dive a little bit more into A-Roll coverage. Now this is the main footage of your video or scene. For an interview it's the subject speaking, just like I mentioned. For a story it's the main characters interaction between, it will, it's the main interactions between characters, okay. So if it's for your TikTok video your A-Roll footage is of you dancing doing some kind of synced music video vibe, right. But if you add a cutaway shot to that then there would be a little bit more depth. So that's the A-Roll, the cutaway shots of the B-Roll. Overall it's the main driving force of the entire video. And lastly A-Roll is generally shot first. So for this course for example, if you're doing a video that's going to be a little bit more focused, you're going to want to have a B-Roll coverage. So for example I'm shooting all my main A-Roll footage and then I have a shot list of basically what needs to be layered on top of that. And then I go boom knock out the shot list and then I have everything that I need to work with in post-production. Now B-Roll coverage is the cutaway shots, the inserts, the close-ups of when someone is speaking or picking up the phone or something important happens. That's what you're adding on on top of your footage. It can be an object of importance like a picture or a picture of the person you're trying to get in touch with. That's something that makes you to close up after filming the main scene. It's the shots overlaid on top of your interview or your footage just like this cutaway shot of the screen right. The text that you're seeing on screen is technically B-Roll footage that's overlaid on top of the A-Roll footage to further explain and get across to you, the viewer, the video that's happening in your mind to further get across the point of what I'm trying to teach of video is this is the overall concept so you're showing the audience the important things to take note of so it's kind of like an establishing shot of a character that's in a specific location right it's a big part of making a higher produced video is really by using these cool cutaway shots so here's an example of what this coverage looks like you have to create style thousand something that that you see style of something that you bring that's more than anything physical I've been through so much of my lifetime the biggest thing was me tearing my ACL you know and I just try to do like in and out you kind of just pop the first time then I try to go in a second time and that's when I know I tore I feel like if you get down and you worry you know like that means you don't have the belief that you say you do so this leads us to different shot types so in the next lecture I'm gonna dive into what these different type of shot types are and then we're gonna go over a learning exercise we're gonna create our own shot list and then you guys are gonna shadow me and see the actual process of having our a roll coverage ideally you've already shot that during this course and then I'm gonna walk you through the process step-by-step of how I would go about shooting this different kind of b-roll coverage using different shot types and using camera movement and other cool little tricks that you guys will be able to incorporate into all your future videos. So let's get into it. I'll see you in the next lecture.",

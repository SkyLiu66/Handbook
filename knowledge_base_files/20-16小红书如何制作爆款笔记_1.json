        "Content": "Creating engaging notes on Xiaohongshu involves focusing on building a persona that shares and recommends products genuinely, rather than overtly selling them. The key components of a note include the main image, title, and text. The main image is crucial as it is the first thing users see. It should be clear, high-quality, and visually appealing. The background should be clean and the product should be prominently displayed. Adding text overlays can also enhance the image. The title should be catchy and include numbers or emotional triggers to attract attention. The text should be concise and highlight the product's features and personal experiences. Avoid being too commercial; instead, aim to create a sense of trust and authenticity."

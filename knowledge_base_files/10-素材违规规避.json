        "Content": "When creating content for platforms like Xiaohongshu and Douyin, it's essential to adhere to specific standards to ensure your videos are approved and perform well. First, check that the text in your videos does not exceed the screen boundaries and limit the font colors to two. Avoid using celebrities, as this can lead to content being blocked. Refrain from using absolute terms like 'best,' 'ultimate,' or 'national-level,' as these are not allowed. Additionally, do not mention specific brands or religious content. Ensure that your videos do not contain offensive language, extensive tattoos, nudity, or cleavage. For audio, avoid using commercial music that requires a paid license and ensure the sound levels are consistent to prevent audio distortion. Following these guidelines will help your content meet platform standards and increase its chances of being promoted."

Start by setting a competitive bid to ensure your ads are shown to a broader audience. If your ads are not performing well, consider increasing your bid incrementally until you see improved results. It's important to understand that a higher bid does not necessarily mean higher costs per conversion; it simply increases the likelihood of your ad being displayed. Monitor your campaign's performance regularly and adjust your bids based on the data. If your ads still do not perform well despite high bids, consider switching to a different bidding strategy, such as targeting a broader audience or using a different ad format. By continuously optimizing your bidding strategy, you can achieve better results and a higher return on investment for your ad campaigns."

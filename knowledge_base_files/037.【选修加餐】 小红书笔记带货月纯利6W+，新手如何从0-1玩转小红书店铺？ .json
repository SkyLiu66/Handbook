        "Content": "Setting up a store on Xiaohongshu is relatively straightforward and accessible, even for beginners. The platform's low entry barriers make it an attractive option for new sellers. To start, you need a mobile phone and a computer. The computer is essential for tasks like importing and exporting spreadsheets and managing logistics. Additionally, having multiple Xiaohongshu accounts linked to different phone numbers can be beneficial. You will also need accounts on platforms like 1688, Pinduoduo, and Taobao, especially if you plan to operate without holding inventory. The initial deposit for opening a personal store is 1000 RMB, which is refundable upon closing the store. It's crucial to have sufficient funds for order fulfillment, as the platform's payment cycle ranges from 7 to 15 days. For those using a no-inventory model, investing in software to manage orders and listings is advisable. Finally, ensure all your identification and payment methods are consistent and verified to avoid any operational issues."

        "Content": "On Xiaohongshu, there are two types of professional accounts: personal and enterprise. A personal professional account is free and requires real-name verification using a personal ID. This type of account allows individuals to open a personal store and even help other influencers with their sales. On the other hand, an enterprise professional account requires an annual certification fee of 600 RMB and a business license. This account type does not need personal ID verification and allows one business license to open up to three stores. Enterprise accounts are ideal for those planning to manage multiple stores, as they can leverage the business license to open several accounts. Additionally, enterprise accounts can distribute their products through other influencers, making it easier to expand their reach. To open a professional account, navigate to the 'Creation Center' on Xiaohongshu and follow the steps to become a professional account holder."

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu offers several types of stores: personal stores, individual business stores, ordinary enterprise stores, specialty stores, and flagship stores. A personal store requires a personal ID, bank card, and phone number, and it has a 1000 RMB deposit. If the product categories are limited, the store can be upgraded to an individual business store, which requires a business license and allows for more product categories. Ordinary enterprise stores also require a business license and can sell a wider range of products, but they have higher deposit requirements, ranging from 2000 to 50000 RMB. Specialty stores can sell multiple authorized brands, while flagship stores are for selling products under a single brand. Each store type has different requirements and benefits, so choose the one that best fits your business needs. To open a store, select the desired store type during the application process and provide the necessary documentation."

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu's platform fees are structured to support small and new businesses. If your monthly sales are less than 10,000 RMB, the platform does not charge any service fees. However, if your sales exceed this amount, a 5% service fee is applied to the excess. For example, if you sell 15,000 RMB worth of products in a month, the first 10,000 RMB is fee-free, and the remaining 5,000 RMB is subject to a 5% fee. Store names are also an important consideration. For personal stores, the store name is the same as the Xiaohongshu account name and can be changed every seven days. For enterprise stores, changing the store name involves re-submitting the business license and paying the 600 RMB certification fee again. Therefore, it's crucial to choose your store name carefully during the initial setup to avoid additional costs and administrative work later on."

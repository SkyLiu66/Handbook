        "Content": "A good cover image is crucial for attracting viewers on platforms like Xiaohongshu. The cover image determines whether users will click on your content. Unlike platforms like Douyin, where content is pushed to users, Xiaohongshu users actively choose what to view based on the cover image. Therefore, a well-designed cover image that is clear, visually appealing, and informative can significantly increase your click-through rate. It should align with your account's theme and highlight the key points of your content. Investing time and effort into creating an attractive cover image can make a substantial difference in the visibility and engagement of your posts."

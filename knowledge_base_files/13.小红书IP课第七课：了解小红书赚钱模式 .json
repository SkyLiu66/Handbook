        "Content": "Monetization on Xiaohongshu can be approached through active or passive strategies. Active monetization involves directly selling products or services, leveraging your personal brand to build trust with your audience. This method doesn't rely heavily on the number of followers but rather on the accuracy and engagement of your audience. Passive monetization, on the other hand, relies on advertising revenue. This method requires a larger follower base and involves creating content that attracts brands looking to advertise. While passive monetization can provide substantial income, it is often less stable and more competitive. Combining both strategies can provide a balanced approach, ensuring a steady income while maximizing revenue potential."

        "Content": "On Xiaohongshu, setting up a store involves understanding the deposit requirements and payment methods. The deposit for a personal store is typically around 1,000 RMB, but it varies depending on the category. For example, high-value categories like luxury goods or electronics may require higher deposits. The deposit acts as a security measure to protect customer rights, such as ensuring refunds are processed correctly. If you decide to close your store, the deposit is refundable, provided there are no violations. To enable payment methods like WeChat Pay and Alipay, you must pay the deposit. This is crucial as many young consumers prefer these payment methods. Setting up these payment methods involves navigating to the 'Funds' section on the Xiaohongshu backend, where you can link your store to your WeChat and Alipay accounts. This setup ensures smooth transactions and enhances customer trust."

By enabling 运费宝, sellers can ensure that the shipping costs for returned items are covered, which can significantly reduce disputes and enhance customer satisfaction. This feature is similar to the '7-day no reason return' policy on platforms like Taobao and Douyin. To activate 运费宝, navigate to the 'After-sales' section in the Xiaohongshu backend and select 'Enable Full Store 运费宝 Service.' This will automatically cover the shipping costs for returns, thereby encouraging more customers to make purchases without the fear of losing money on shipping if they decide to return the product. This setup can improve your store's conversion rate and reduce the rate of order cancellations."

        "Content": "Proper address and logistics settings are essential for smooth operations on Xiaohongshu. When setting up your store, it's important to configure your address settings accurately. This includes specifying a return address, which should ideally be in a remote area to manage returns effectively. Additionally, you should include a note for customers to contact customer service for the correct return address. This can be done in the 'Order Logistics Tools' section, where you can create a new address entry. For logistics, if you are a dropshipping seller, ensure that your logistics settings are synchronized with your supplier. If you have your own inventory, simply input your warehouse address. Properly setting up these logistics details ensures that your shipping and return processes are efficient, reducing the likelihood of disputes and enhancing customer satisfaction."

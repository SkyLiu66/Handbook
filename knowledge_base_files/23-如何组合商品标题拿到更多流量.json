            "Content": "Creating effective product titles can significantly increase your product's exposure and the likelihood of being found by users in the marketplace. A good product title should include the product attribute words, category words, and value keywords. For example, if you are selling Martin boots, your title should clearly indicate the category (boots), the season (2022 autumn/winter), the target audience (women), and the product's unique features (British style, slimming, thick-soled). To find relevant and trending keywords, use tools like JuLiang Analytics. Enter your product keywords, search, and analyze the related terms. Incorporate these hot search terms into your product title to enhance its visibility and attractiveness."

For instance, if you are selling Martin boots, you might find that terms like 'British style' and 'short boots' are popular.

Access the merchant management backend, click on data, and then source analysis. This will show you the keywords users are searching for in notes or the marketplace. Use these keywords to create or update your product titles. By aligning your titles with the terms users are actively searching for, you increase the chances of your product being discovered. This data-driven approach ensures that your titles are not only descriptive but also highly relevant to potential buyers."

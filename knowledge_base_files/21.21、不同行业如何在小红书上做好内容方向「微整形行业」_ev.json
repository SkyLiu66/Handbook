        "Content": "The cosmetic surgery industry faces significant challenges on Xiaohongshu due to the platform's strict content regulations. Many expert accounts have experienced reduced visibility, and posts are often screened and removed if they do not meet the platform's guidelines. This is primarily because cosmetic surgery involves medical content, which has a high risk of incidents and user complaints, negatively impacting the platform's reputation. Additionally, advertising for medical procedures is difficult to execute on Xiaohongshu, unlike skincare or beauty treatments that do not involve surgery. As a result, Xiaohongshu does not favor the cosmetic surgery industry, leading to severe restrictions on content visibility. To navigate these challenges, it is recommended to use secondary accounts for aggressive traffic generation, focusing on storytelling and user engagement rather than direct advertising."

        "Content": "Aggressive traffic generation on Xiaohongshu involves using secondary accounts to create engaging, story-driven content that resonates with users. This approach avoids direct advertising, which is often flagged and removed by the platform. Instead, focus on sharing personal experiences and stories that users can relate to. For example, a post about a personal journey with cosmetic surgery, including the motivations, experiences, and outcomes, can attract significant attention. The title should be conversational and relatable, such as 'Day 13 of My Weight Loss Journey: Here Are My Thoughts.' The content should highlight emotional aspects, like the reasons for undergoing surgery and the psychological experiences during the process. By creating authentic, story-driven content, you can increase the chances of your posts being featured on the discovery page and gaining more visibility."

Ensure each account has a clear and authentic persona, using real photos and relatable bios. During the account setup phase, engage with relevant content to build a credible presence. When creating posts, focus on keyword optimization by using long-tail keywords and less competitive terms to improve search rankings. Regularly monitor and analyze successful posts from competitors to understand what works and adapt your strategy accordingly. Additionally, use tools to check for sensitive words and ensure your content complies with platform guidelines. By optimizing your account management and content strategy, you can enhance your chances of success on Xiaohongshu."

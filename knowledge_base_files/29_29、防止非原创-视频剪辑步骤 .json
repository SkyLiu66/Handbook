        "Content": "Editing videos can seem daunting, but with the right tools and steps, it becomes manageable. Start by using a simple video editing tool like Jianying. First, import the video you want to edit. Trim the video to a length of 8-10 seconds, as shorter videos tend to perform better on platforms like Xiaohongshu. Adjust the aspect ratio to 3:4 and apply a cartoon effect to obscure any faces to avoid copyright issues. Next, separate the audio from the video if the original audio is important. Adjust the video's brightness, contrast, and saturation slightly to enhance its visual appeal. Add a subtle effect to the video, ensuring it doesn't overpower the original content. Finally, overlay a small, self-recorded video using the 'Picture-in-Picture' feature to add a layer of originality. This process ensures your video is unique and less likely to be flagged for copyright violations."

Increase the brightness and contrast slightly, but avoid making drastic changes that could affect the video's natural look. Apply a subtle filter to enhance the overall aesthetic. Use the 'Picture-in-Picture' feature to overlay a small, self-recorded video, which adds a layer of originality and reduces the risk of copyright issues. Additionally, consider adding stickers or text overlays to make the video more engaging. Ensure these elements are placed in the corners and do not obstruct the main content. Finally, export the video in high resolution, preferably 2K or 4K, with a frame rate of 60fps. This ensures the video maintains its quality when uploaded to social media platforms."

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu has implemented a policy against no-stock drop shipping to maintain the quality and integrity of its e-commerce platform. This policy was introduced in August to curb unregulated practices that were prevalent during the platform's early growth phase. Initially, Xiaohongshu, like other e-commerce platforms such as Taobao and Pinduoduo, allowed various practices to attract merchants. However, as the platform matured, it became necessary to enforce stricter regulations to ensure sustainable growth. The no-stock drop shipping policy specifically targets merchants who do not hold inventory and instead place orders on other platforms like Taobao or 1688 using customer details. This practice often leads to customer complaints and logistical inconsistencies, which the platform aims to eliminate. Merchants must understand and adapt to these changes to continue thriving on Xiaohongshu. By aligning with the platform's policies, merchants can ensure their long-term success and avoid penalties such as account suspension or restrictions on listing new products."

            "factors"
        ],
        "Content": "There are three primary factors that can lead to violations of Xiaohongshu's no-stock drop shipping policy. First, user complaints and reports play a significant role. If customers receive messages or electronic waybills indicating that their orders were placed on other platforms like Taobao or Pinduoduo, they may report the merchant. Such reports can result in the merchant's account being flagged for no-stock drop shipping. Second, the platform uses a big data model to identify suspicious activities. If a merchant's shipping locations exceed three different addresses within a month, the system may flag the account. This is determined based on the actual logistics information of each order, not the addresses entered in the platform's settings. Therefore, merchants should work with a consistent set of suppliers or use centralized warehousing solutions to avoid frequent changes in shipping locations. Third, external public opinion can also influence the platform's decisions. If a particular product receives numerous negative reviews or if multiple merchants use the same supplier, the platform may take action. Merchants should strive to maintain high-quality products and services to avoid such issues."

        "Content": "Adapting to Xiaohongshu's evolving e-commerce policies is crucial for merchants to sustain their business on the platform. The platform's policies are dynamic and change in response to market conditions and user feedback. Merchants must stay informed about these changes and adjust their strategies accordingly. For instance, with the introduction of the no-stock drop shipping policy, merchants need to ensure they hold inventory or work with reliable suppliers who can provide consistent shipping locations. Additionally, maintaining a positive customer experience is essential. This includes timely order fulfillment, high-quality products, and responsive customer service. Merchants should also monitor their logistics data and avoid practices that could trigger the platform's big data model to flag their account. By being proactive and flexible, merchants can navigate the platform's regulatory landscape effectively. Understanding and complying with Xiaohongshu's policies not only helps in avoiding penalties but also builds trust with customers, leading to long-term business success."

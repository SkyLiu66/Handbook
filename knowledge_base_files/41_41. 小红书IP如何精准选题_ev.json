        "Content": "Choosing precise topics through IP involves several steps. First, you need to determine the form of monetization you aim for, whether it's selling products, promoting items (known as 'planting grass'), or business monetization through advertisements. For beginners, focusing on selling products is advisable as it is the most straightforward method. Once the monetization form is clear, the next step is to accumulate good copywriting examples. Study and mimic successful copywriting to improve your own skills. Initially, you can imitate others, but gradually move towards creating original content. This approach is similar to video creation, where you start by mimicking and then move to original content. Finally, innovate new copywriting styles. This systematic approach ensures that your content is engaging and effective, ultimately leading to better monetization."

For example, if you are focusing on fashion, keywords could include 'women's fashion', 'men's fashion', 'fashion outfits', etc. Use these keywords to find popular and trending topics across various platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. Compile a list of 50 to 100 popular titles and keywords. This repository will serve as a reference for creating new content. By having a well-organized topic repository, you can quickly generate content ideas without feeling overwhelmed. This method ensures that your content remains relevant and engaging, helping you attract and retain your audience."

        "Content": "Niche down and expand gradually to build a loyal audience. Start by focusing on a specific sub-niche within your main topic. For instance, if your main topic is fashion, you could start with 'women's summer outfits'. Create detailed content around this sub-niche, such as how to style different types of summer outfits. Once you have established a strong presence in this sub-niche, you can gradually expand to other related topics like 'men's summer outfits' or 'accessories for summer outfits'. This approach allows you to build a focused and engaged audience before broadening your content scope. By starting small and expanding gradually, you ensure that your content remains high-quality and relevant, which helps in retaining your audience and attracting new followers."

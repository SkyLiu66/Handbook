        "Content": "To identify benchmark accounts on Xiaohongshu, focus on finding accounts similar to your niche. For example, if you are in the clothing business, look for accounts that are personal stores rather than official or flagship stores. Personal stores are usually marked with 'XX's Store' and are opened using personal identification. Avoid accounts with a blue verification badge, as these often use paid promotions, which may not reflect organic growth. Additionally, steer clear of accounts with a large follower base, as their success may be due to their established audience rather than their content strategy. Instead, target accounts with a smaller follower base but consistent engagement. These accounts are more likely to provide realistic benchmarks for your growth. By studying these accounts, you can gain insights into effective content strategies, product offerings, and audience engagement techniques."

        "Content": "Utilize Xiaohongshu's discovery and search features to find relevant benchmark accounts. Start by exploring the 'Discover' page, which recommends content based on your account's activity. If your account is already tailored to a specific niche, such as fashion, you will find relevant accounts in the 'Discover' section. For those whose accounts are not yet optimized, use specific keywords related to your niche in the search bar. For example, if you are in the beauty or home decor niche, search for terms like 'beauty' or 'home decor.' Engage with the content by liking and saving posts to help the algorithm understand your interests. Over time, this will refine your recommendations, making it easier to find high-quality benchmark accounts. Regularly interacting with these accounts will provide you with a steady stream of inspiration and best practices to implement in your own strategy."

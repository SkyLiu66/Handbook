The 'Note Inspiration' feature provides various topics that receive official backing. After selecting a topic, you will receive a notification in the message section of your Xiaohongshu app. It's crucial to utilize this support by consistently posting notes under these topics. Initially, experiment with different topics to see which ones receive the most support.

For instance, if you are posting about lingerie, search for related topics and compare their view counts. Opt for topics with the highest views, such as 'Comfortable Lingerie Recommendations' with 13.4 billion views, over less popular ones. This strategy ensures that your notes are seen by a larger audience. Additionally, stick to relevant topics; if your note is about lingerie, don't include unrelated topics like underwear. Aim to include 5 to 10 topics per note, with at least 5 being the minimum. By carefully selecting high-traffic topics, you can significantly increase the reach of your notes."

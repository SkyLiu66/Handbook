        "Content": "To find trending products on Xiaohongshu without spending money on third-party software, you can use two main methods. First, search for relevant keywords, such as 'dress,' and filter the results to show posts from the last seven days. Look for posts with high engagement (likes and comments) and check if they have recent comments to ensure the product is still trending. Avoid posts from flagship stores or sponsored posts, as these are paid promotions. Second, use the 'Products' tab and sort by sales volume. Focus on products with moderate sales (a few hundred to a few thousand) that have been posted recently, as these indicate rising trends. Avoid products with extremely high sales, as the market may already be saturated. By following these steps, you can identify popular and emerging products on Xiaohongshu."

        "Content": "When searching for products on Xiaohongshu, it's important to avoid flagship and sponsored posts. Flagship posts are often marked with a special icon and are typically from well-known brands that have paid for promotion. Sponsored posts are also paid advertisements and may not reflect genuine user interest. To ensure you are finding organically popular products, focus on user-generated content that has high engagement without paid promotion. Look for posts with high likes, comments, and saves, and check if the engagement is recent. This indicates that the product is genuinely popular among users. By filtering out paid promotions, you can get a more accurate picture of what products are trending and have the potential for high sales."

When using the 'Products' tab, sort the results by sales volume to see which products are selling well. Focus on products with moderate sales (a few hundred to a few thousand) that have been posted recently. These products are likely to be on the rise and have not yet reached market saturation. Avoid products with extremely high sales, as the market may already be saturated, making it harder to compete. Additionally, check if the product is from a flagship store or has been heavily promoted, as these factors can skew the sales data. By focusing on organically popular products with rising sales, you can identify items with high potential for success in the market."

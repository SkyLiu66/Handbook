Data tools like GreyData can assist in this process by providing insights into trending items and popular content. Start by using the tool to search for low-follower viral posts, which can give you an idea of what products are gaining traction despite having fewer followers. This can be particularly useful for identifying niche markets. Additionally, look at the interaction rates and estimated views to gauge the popularity of specific products. For example, if a post about a particular type of dress has high interaction rates, it indicates strong consumer interest. Use these insights to curate a list of products that are likely to perform well. This data-driven approach ensures that you are selecting products with proven demand, increasing your chances of success."

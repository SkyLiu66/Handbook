        "Content": "Increasing the total volume of your private domain traffic is crucial for improving your conversion rates. The internet's average conversion rate ranges between 5% to 10%. If you only have a few hundred followers in your private domain, your potential conversions will be limited. For instance, with 200 followers, you might only convert 10 to 20 people. Therefore, to achieve higher sales, you need to focus on expanding your private domain. This can be done through various methods such as engaging content, targeted advertising, and effective use of social media platforms. Once you have a larger audience, even a small percentage of conversions can result in significant sales. It's important to understand that the key to higher conversions lies in the initial volume of your audience. By increasing your private domain traffic, you create more opportunities for engagement and sales."

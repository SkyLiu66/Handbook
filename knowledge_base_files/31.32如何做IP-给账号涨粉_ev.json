        "Content": "Building a personal IP (Intellectual Property) on Xiaohongshu is essential for increasing your account's followers and engagement. Your account itself is your IP, and it should be crafted to reflect a specific niche or category. For example, if you are selling phone cases, your account should focus solely on phone cases, making it a vertical IP. This specialization helps in establishing a clear identity and makes it easier for users to understand what your account is about. Your personal profile should include a clear and concise bio with relevant tags that describe your niche. This helps visitors quickly grasp your content focus, increasing the likelihood of them following you. Consistency in your posts and maintaining a clear theme are crucial for building a strong personal IP."

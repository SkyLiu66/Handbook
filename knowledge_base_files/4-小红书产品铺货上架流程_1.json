        "Content": "The Ant Moving Tool is a popular software for quickly uploading products to your store. It involves two main steps: setting up basic product information and preparing for the move. First, configure the basic settings such as brand (select 'Other' if no brand), shipping template (use a default non-remote area template), and logistics plan (choose self-shipping with a standard three-day dispatch time). Adjust the selling price by multiplying the original price by 200% and adding a small margin. Once these settings are saved, you can bulk upload product links from various platforms like Pinduoduo, Taobao, and 1688. The tool will automatically process and upload these products to your store, making it easier to manage large inventories efficiently."

        "Content": "When selecting products to upload, it's crucial to evaluate their authenticity and popularity. Look for products with high sales and a proportionate number of reviews. For example, a product with 20,000 sales and 2,800 reviews is likely genuine, whereas a product with 100,000 sales but only a few reviews may have inflated figures. This evaluation helps ensure that the products you choose are genuinely popular and well-received by customers. Additionally, check the product images and descriptions for any brand names or prohibited keywords, as these need to be removed to comply with platform policies. By carefully selecting and evaluating products, you can maintain a high-quality inventory that appeals to your target audience."

After uploading products, review and fill in all necessary details to make the listings as complete as possible.

The more detailed and accurate your listings, the higher the chances of appearing in search results. Additionally, replace any low-quality or cluttered images with high-quality ones that clearly showcase the product. Complete listings with comprehensive information and appealing visuals attract more customers and improve the likelihood of sales. Regularly updating and optimizing your listings can significantly enhance your store's performance."

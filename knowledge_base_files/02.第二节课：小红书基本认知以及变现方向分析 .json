        "Content": "To set up a store on Xiaohongshu, you need to ensure your device and network are clean, meaning they haven't been flagged for previous violations. Avoid frequently switching between multiple accounts on the same device. For a personal store, you can start with zero followers and no deposit. The process involves registering on Xiaohongshu, accessing the 'Creation Center,' and selecting 'Open Store.' Choose a category like 'Home Goods' to start, as it doesn't require a deposit. For individual business or corporate stores, you will need a business license and a deposit. These stores can be upgraded later to include more features and link multiple accounts. Ensure your phone number and ID are verified to avoid issues during the setup process."

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu offers several monetization methods. The first is through your own store, where you can sell products by posting notes or live streaming. Ensure your device and network are clean to avoid account issues. The second method is becoming a 'Buyer,' similar to a TikTok influencer, where you promote other sellers' products. This requires at least 1,000 followers. The third method involves using the 'Supply Backend' to list your products for other buyers to promote. This is available for individual business and corporate stores. The fourth method is directing traffic to your private domain (private social media accounts), although Xiaohongshu has strict rules against direct note-based promotions. Lastly, you can become an influencer and earn through advertisements, although this is more challenging for beginners."

Use multiple accounts to test different products and identify those with the highest potential. Once products are selected, list them in your store and create engaging content to promote them. Regularly update your store and interact with customers to build trust and loyalty. Additionally, be aware of the platform's rules and guidelines to avoid penalties. For example, using one phone per account and avoiding duplicate content can help maintain your account's standing. Finally, monitor your store's performance and adjust your strategies based on sales data and customer feedback. Consider upgrading to an individual business or corporate store for more features and flexibility."

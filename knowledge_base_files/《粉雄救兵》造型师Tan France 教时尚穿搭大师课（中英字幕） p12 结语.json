If I'm walking down the street in an outfit that makes me feel so good, that's all that matters. Even if somebody else, even if Anna Wynne to the queen herself says, it's not really on trend. If I feel amazing in it, it doesn't matter. I respect her more than most people, but I would still think I feel great in it. It makes me feel exactly how I want to feel in my clothes and therefore it's stylish. As far as I'm concerned, when I look at somebody and I'm thinking, do they have style or not? The main thing is, are they carrying themselves well? Have they got their head held high? Is it clear that they've put a lot together? Even if it's not, my style in particular, if it's something that you can see they are enjoying and they're standing tall, that's great style. The way you carry yourself is important. The way you stand displays confidence. So even if you've got the best outfit in the world on, if you're not feeling it, you are not going to display that confidence you think you are. I love my outfit right now. It's simple, it's sophisticated. But if I were to stand like this, it's very clear I don't have the confidence in what I'm wearing. I'm a little bit nervous about it and I don't know if you should take me seriously. If I stand appropriately, I kick my knees back. I'm standing straight. I am commanding the room. I am telling people I made a great style choice today. I feel wonderful in what I've got on and I'm ready to take on whatever you've got for me. You may find after this class that you are now in a position to be able to critique other people's style and give advice. Maybe slow your roll real quick. Figure out your own style. Really become comfortable in who you are and get to the point where you feel it every day, where you've done the most. At that point, maybe you can start to give advice. Maybe let's ease into that first. Take care of yourself before you take care of others. If you feel inclined to give people suggestions if they're asking for style advice, go ahead and give them some advice. If you feel inclined to give them some advice, go ahead and give them some advice. If you feel inclined to give people suggestions if they're asking for style advice, go ahead and give them some advice. If you feel But just be cautious. There's a way of giving feedback that's not cruel. I'm going to give you an example. I do this for my husband regularly. If you have mean things to say about somebody's outfit, it is too late once they've purchased it. It's too late once they've got it on. What you do instead is if you truly are a good friend, you will help your friend shop if you know that their style is a little heinous. By doing this, you are helping them because you are going before they actually are going. If you're not going, you're going to help them. If you're not going, you're have spent their money, you are saying, yes, this works for you. No, this doesn't work for you. And the way you do it is, I know we can find better options. You don't need to say that's horrible. You don't need to say that you look this or that in this item of clothing. Just say, we haven't finished our search. There's better options available. I know it. Let's go find it. And there's a way you can do it if the person's already purchased something. If you have a partner who you want to help or a friend who you want to help, help them get changed. Again, if they are putting an outfit together and they come out and say, does this work? Is this right for where we're going? I know you've got much better options in your closet. I'm going to go help you find them. It's a nice way of letting somebody down. Style is not just for outside of the house. I want to feel good about myself all day, every day. I refuse to be the reason I'm unhappy. When I look in the mirror, I want to know I've done everything I can to present myself well, whether it be to people out on the street or just whoever's in my home, my husband. If I'm having a lazy day and I don't get dressed up and I decide I'm just going to throw clothes on, it dictates my mood for the entire day. And it's not just about how people view me. It's how I will behave myself. If I know that I've thought about what I'm wearing, if I've laid something out in the morning, looked in the mirror and thought I've done the best I possibly can today, I feel the best I possibly can. It encourages a certain kind of inner confidence that can only be achieved by knowing that you are presenting yourself to the world the way you want to. And so even though I'm at home, even though I want to be comfortable, I make sure that even my pajamas are styled appropriately. I want them to be nice. I want them to be clean. I want them to be relatively flattering or as flattering as possible whilst I'm not suggesting it has to be a matching set. I'm not suggesting it has to be silk. Just find pajamas that actually look nice on you, that make you feel lovely. The same kind of feelings you have when you get dressed up for going outside of the house. I want to look good all the time because it makes me feel good. I want you to feel that too. Pajamas, in my opinion, are for around the house. When you go to sleep, I suggest sleeping naked. It feels great. One more comment about my pajamas. I'm not saying that pajamas are not for me, but I'm not saying that pajamas are not for me. One of the things about pajamas that I think is very important is when you wear your pajamas around the house, please wear underwear because you are wearing your pajamas for a few hours. At some point, you will need to pee and you just don't want an extra dribble in your pajamas. That's vile. Don't be that dirty bugger. Wear underwear. I'm not saying a bra. Ladies out there, feel free to let that bra go, but please wear underwear. Men and women. Thanks. Too much of information. If there's one thing that you took away from this class, I would like it to be that you know the most important thing is how you feel in your wardrobe. I want you to really start to see your closet as a vehicle to getting what you want from your life. I want you to really feel something when you get dressed in the morning. I want you to look in your closet and decide, who do I want to see in my closet? Who do I want to see in my closet? Who do I want to see in my closet? Who do I want to be? What do I want to feel? What do I not want to feel anymore? I don't want you to see clothes in your closet as occasion wear. I don't want you to look in your closet and think, I've got that fancy thing that I'll wear hopefully twice this year. If that makes you feel so good, wear it today. Feel the same kind of feeling you feel every day when you wear that one fancy thing. Make sure that you feel that feeling as often as physically possible. Why wait for a special occasion? Make every day your special occasion. I do it every day. Every day I get ready, I think, I want to feel the way I felt on my wedding day. And I do. I just want you to make an effort every day. Know that you've made an effort. Be the reason that you're happy.",

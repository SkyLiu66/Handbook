Now it's your turn. It's your turn to film a talking scene with your phone or your camera. And something that I want you guys to keep in mind while going through this learning exercise is that ideally you're actually talking to the camera and we'll be using your words or the topic that you're talking about to create a shot list of cutaway shots. Basically it'll look something like this. But I am addicted to coffee. I just love the entire experience of those lovely textured beans and then brewing it when you pour that. So it's pretty sure that you guys are going to be able to see the difference between the two. So let's get straight forward. Now it's your turn to shoot. You're going to film one talking shot in two different ways. Okay. The first way is going to be the standard shot without any of the techniques that we've discussed so far in this course. This might be the way that you would film your video normally without having any idea of these new techniques and principles. And then the second way is going to be your upgraded shot with these new techniques that you've learned. And that's going to be framing shot type focus exposure distance between the subject and the background right using a contrast in coloring using lighting and using good sound techniques. Then you're going to export your video link or screenshots with the standard and upgraded shot one after the other to the course Q&A that way you can engage with your classmates. They can engage with you. You guys can critique each other's work and you can all see how you can improve on your talking video shot for all your future videos. So hopefully that makes sense and I will see you guys in the next lecture.",

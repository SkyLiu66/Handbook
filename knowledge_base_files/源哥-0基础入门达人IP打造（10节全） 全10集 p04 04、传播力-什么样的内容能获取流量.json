    "Content": "In today's digital age, building a personal brand and gaining traffic is key to success. First, you need to understand the three basic purposes of posting videos: gaining traffic, building persona, and quick conversion. Each purpose has its unique strategies and target audience.\n\n1. Gaining Traffic: This is the most common purpose, accounting for 60% of all video content. The goal is to make more potential users aware of you and familiar with your brand or service. To achieve this, you need to create content relevant to your target market, ensuring it captures their attention and prompts them to take action.\n\n2. Building Persona: This type of content makes up 30% of video content and aims to build trust and recognition. By sharing your personal stories, professional knowledge, and success cases, you can make those who already know you trust you more, thereby increasing conversion rates.\n\n3. Quick Conversion: The final 10% of content should focus on closing deals. This may include directly selling products or services or offering special promotions to incentivize viewers to take action.\n\nWhen creating content, it's important to ensure your videos are not just about gaining traffic. While gaining traffic is crucial, if you focus solely on this, your audience may feel exploited and lose interest. Instead, you should build trust by providing valuable content and then gradually guide them towards making a purchase.\n\nIn summary, building a personal brand and gaining traffic requires a balanced approach that attracts new viewers while also building a trusting relationship with them. By understanding and utilizing the above strategies, you can enhance the impact of your content, thereby increasing your audience's awareness and trust in your brand or service."

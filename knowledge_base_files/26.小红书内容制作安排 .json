        "Content": "The main image is crucial in content creation, especially for IP accounts. It holds 40% of the overall weight in attracting viewers. The main image is the first thing people see, and if it is not appealing, they are unlikely to click on the content. The image should convey the core message clearly and attractively. For example, if the content is about fashion, the main image could show a stylish outfit that piques curiosity. The image should also reflect the theme, such as autumn or winter fashion, and include elements that resonate with the target audience. It's essential to study competitors' main images and draw inspiration from them to create compelling visuals."

        "Content": "The first three seconds of a video are critical for capturing the viewer's attention. This period is often referred to as the 'golden three seconds.' If the content fails to engage the viewer within this timeframe, it is unlikely they will continue watching. The opening should be visually appealing and directly address the viewer's needs or curiosity. A good strategy is to start with a question or a bold statement that highlights the video's value. For instance, in a fashion video, the opening could ask, 'Want to know how to style a beige coat for autumn?' This approach immediately informs the viewer of the video's content and encourages them to keep watching."

        "Content": "Titles and copy are essential components of content that contribute to its overall effectiveness. While they hold 10% of the weight, their role in attracting and retaining viewers is significant. A good title should be concise, around 20 words, and include functional words, pain points, and context-specific terms. For example, a title for a fashion video could be, 'How to Style a Beige Coat for Autumn: Tips for Petite Women.' The copy should complement the title by providing additional context and enticing the viewer to engage with the content. Studying competitors' titles and copy can provide valuable insights into what works and help in crafting compelling content."

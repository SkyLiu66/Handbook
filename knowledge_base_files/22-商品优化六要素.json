            "Content": "To optimize your product listings for faster sales, follow these steps: First, focus on your product title. Use a formula that includes product attribute words, category words, and value keywords. Attribute words refer to the product's classification, model, and functional characteristics. Category words indicate the type of product, such as women's clothing, bags, socks, or phone cases. Value keywords highlight the benefits the product offers to the buyer, emphasizing value beyond the product's basic functions. Ensure your title is up to 60 characters long to maximize exposure. Avoid using prohibited terms like brand names, celebrity endorsements, or extreme claims such as 'best' or 'top-selling.'"

            "Content": "Next, optimize your product attributes. Fill in all required fields and complete optional ones to provide comprehensive information, which can increase user understanding and conversion rates. For product specifications, limit the number of options to no more than eight, except for categories like phone cases. Too many options can overwhelm customers and reduce their likelihood of making a purchase. If you have many specifications, consider creating separate product listings for different sets of specifications."

            "Content": "When setting prices, especially if you are importing products from other stores, adjust the price to include at least a 30% profit margin. Use tools like a price markup calculator if needed. Compare your prices with competitors to ensure they are competitive but not too low, as excessively low prices can hurt your profitability."

If you are using images from other stores, check for any text or store names on the images and remove them using photo editing tools. Avoid using images with prohibited terms like 'celebrity-endorsed,' 'best-selling,' or 'lowest price.'"

If the product lacks a size chart, find a similar product with a size chart and include it. Ensure the shipping time is synchronized with your actual shipping schedule. Once everything is set, publish your product listing. This detailed approach to product optimization can significantly enhance your chances of making sales."

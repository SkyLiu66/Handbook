For example, if a down jacket costs 100 yuan on Pinduoduo, you can list it on Xiaohongshu for 200-300 yuan. The profit is the difference between the purchase price and the selling price. This business model requires minimal investment, primarily a smartphone and a computer. The initial investment is low, but the potential returns can be significant. The course emphasizes the importance of execution and provides detailed steps to help participants achieve their first significant earnings through Xiaohongshu e-commerce."

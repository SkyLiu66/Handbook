        "Content": "Several key factors influence the number of views a note receives on Xiaohongshu. The most critical element is the cover image, which must be attractive and high-quality to draw users' attention. The second most important factor is the title, followed by the content of the note. Engaging content that encourages likes, saves, follows, and comments will boost the note's visibility. If a note meets these criteria, Xiaohongshu's algorithm is more likely to promote it. Conversely, if the note fails to attract initial engagement, it will not receive further exposure. Therefore, creating visually appealing and engaging content is essential for increasing note views."

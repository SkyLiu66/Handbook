        "Content": "Selecting products based on popular Xiaohongshu posts can significantly increase your chances of success. Start by identifying posts that have gone viral within the last seven days. Focus on image-based posts rather than videos, as images can be more easily converted into videos if needed. Additionally, choose posts that do not have product links, as this indicates that the product is not yet being heavily marketed. By finding these posts and sourcing the corresponding products, you can leverage the existing popularity to drive traffic and sales to your own listings. This method allows you to capitalize on trends and reduce competition, making it easier to attract potential buyers."

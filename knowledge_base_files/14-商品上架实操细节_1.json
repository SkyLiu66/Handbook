        "Content": "To find and prepare product images for your store, start by sourcing images from platforms like Xiaohongshu, 1688, or Pinduoduo. Use the image search feature to find similar products. Once you identify a suitable product, download the main images and detailed images. If the images are not clear, use software like Wink to enhance the image quality. Additionally, you can source images from Taobao, but be cautious of watermarks or store names embedded in the images. Ensure that the images you choose are clear and accurately represent the product. This step is crucial as high-quality images attract more customers and improve the overall appearance of your store."

Copy and modify the product title from the source, ensuring it is unique and relevant. Upload the main images and detailed images, making sure they are clear and correspond to the product specifications. For example, if you are selling a yellow floral design, only upload images of that design. Next, fill in the product attributes such as style, season, and material. Ensure these attributes match the product details. Finally, set the product price and inventory. Consider setting a higher price initially to allow for discount coupons. Once all details are filled in, submit the listing for publication. This process ensures that your product listings are accurate and appealing to potential customers."

        "Content": "Setting product specifications and pricing is a critical step in managing your store. Begin by defining the product specifications such as size, color, and material. Ensure these specifications match the product images and descriptions. For example, if you are selling a product in multiple colors, create separate listings for each color. Next, set the product price. It is advisable to set a slightly higher price initially to accommodate discount coupons. For instance, if the product's cost price is $60, you might set the selling price at $99 and offer a $10 discount coupon, making the final price $89. This strategy not only attracts customers but also provides a buffer for promotional activities. Additionally, set the inventory levels to ensure you can meet customer demand. By carefully setting product specifications and pricing, you can optimize your store's performance and customer satisfaction."

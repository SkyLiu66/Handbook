        "Content": "To publish your content effectively, you need to choose the right entry point. The simplest way is to use the '+' button in the middle of the app to upload your work directly. Another method is to use the 'Inspiration' section in the 'Creation Center,' which can be accessed through the three horizontal lines in the top right corner. This section provides various content ideas based on different categories, allowing you to tap into platform-specific topics and trends. Additionally, if you are selling products, you can use the 'Shop Management' section to find trending keywords and categories related to your products. This helps in targeting the right audience and gaining more visibility. By using these entry points, you can ensure that your content reaches the right audience and gains maximum engagement."

        "Content": "The timing of your content publication can significantly impact its reach and engagement. Different times of the day have varying levels of user activity. For instance, early morning (7-8 AM) is a good time as people are commuting and checking their phones. Avoid publishing between 9 AM and 12 PM as most people are busy with work. The best time to publish is in the evening, especially between 6 PM and 9:30 PM, when users are more relaxed and likely to engage with content. Late-night hours (10 PM to 12 AM) are also effective, particularly for emotional or impulse-driven content. Tailor your publishing schedule based on your target audience's habits. For example, beauty and skincare content performs well in the late morning and evening, while food-related content should be posted around meal times. By aligning your publishing schedule with user activity, you can maximize engagement and reach."

        "Content": "Tagging official accounts related to your content can significantly boost its visibility. When you mention or 'at' these accounts, there is a chance that they will notice and promote your content, leading to a surge in traffic. For example, if you are posting about beauty products, tagging the official beauty account can help your post get noticed. Even if the official account does not promote your content immediately, consistently tagging them increases your chances of being noticed in the future. This practice does not negatively impact your content's reach, so it is a low-risk, high-reward strategy. Make it a habit to tag relevant official accounts in your posts. Over time, this can lead to increased visibility and engagement, helping your content reach a broader audience."

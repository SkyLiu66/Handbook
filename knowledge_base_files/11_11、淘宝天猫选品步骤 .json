Start by navigating to the homepage and finding the 'More Channels' section. Focus on channels like 'Super New Products' and 'Little Black Box,' which feature high-quality and well-reviewed products. The 'Little Black Box' includes a variety of categories such as bags, accessories, and food, all known for their superior quality. When selecting products, prioritize those with high sales and good reviews. Capture screenshots of these products and search for their suppliers on platforms like 1688 to find cheaper sources. Avoid directly reselling products from Taobao as it may not be profitable. Instead, use Taobao to identify trending products and then source them at lower prices elsewhere. This method ensures you are offering high-quality products while maintaining a good profit margin."

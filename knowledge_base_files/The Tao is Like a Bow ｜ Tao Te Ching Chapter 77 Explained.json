This aligns with the principles of Tao, which encourages taking from the excess and providing to those in need. By doing so, you not only help others but also enrich your own life and contribute positively to the world around you. Remember, the true sage acts selflessly, without seeking praise or recognition, focusing on being one with Tao and enhancing their capacity to benefit the world."

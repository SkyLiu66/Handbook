        "Content": "Setting up your Xiaohongshu store involves several key steps. First, download the Xiaohongshu app from any major application platform and log in. Once logged in, you need to set up your address. This includes a logistics template where you can specify if you want to offer free shipping or not, especially for remote areas like Xinjiang or Tibet. This setting is for your reference and not visible to others. Next, fill in your shipping address accurately. This should be your actual address, such as 'Heilongjiang, Harbin Fire Station' if you live there. After setting up the address, save the information. The next step is store certification. Fill in your name, phone number, and business address. For the business type, select 'Individual Engaged in Small-Scale Trading Activities.' This is crucial for avoiding unnecessary complications. You don't need to worry about the deposit initially. You can pay it once you start making sales and have earned enough to cover it. This approach minimizes your startup costs and risks."

        "Content": "Store certification on Xiaohongshu requires you to fill in your personal details such as your name, phone number, and business address. It's advisable to use your phone number as the primary contact to avoid any communication issues. For the business type, select 'Individual Engaged in Small-Scale Trading Activities.' This selection is important as it simplifies the certification process. Regarding the deposit, Xiaohongshu requires a deposit of 1,000 yuan for personal stores. However, you don't need to pay this upfront. You can start selling and only pay the deposit once your earnings exceed 1,000 yuan. This method allows you to start your business with zero initial cost. Similarly, you don't need to activate WeChat Pay immediately, as most customers can use Alipay. This approach reduces your financial risk and makes it easier to start your business."

The platform allows you to defer the deposit payment until you start making sales and have sufficient earnings. This means you don't need to worry about losing money if your products don't sell.

By focusing on these strategies, you can start your business with zero initial cost, making it a low-risk venture. This approach is particularly beneficial for individuals looking to explore new income streams or start a side business without significant financial commitment."

        "Content": "When posting content on Xiaohongshu, it is important to understand the standards and guidelines. You can choose to write detailed notes or simply use titles and tags. For some categories, detailed notes are necessary, while for others, they are not. If you find that most of your competitors are not writing detailed notes, you can follow suit. However, if your competitors are writing detailed notes, it is advisable to do the same. The key is to ensure that your content is engaging and visually appealing. Videos and images should clearly showcase the product's features and benefits. If your video content is compelling, it may not be necessary to write detailed notes. However, if your video gains significant traction, you can add detailed notes later to provide more information and improve conversion rates."

At this point, you can edit your post to include more detailed information, ensuring that you avoid any sensitive or prohibited words. This approach helps you stay compliant with the platform's rules while gradually enhancing your content."

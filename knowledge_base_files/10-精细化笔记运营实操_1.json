        "Content": "To effectively manage your Xiaohongshu store, it's crucial to understand the platform's note traffic. Currently, most traffic on Xiaohongshu comes from notes rather than the store itself. This means that creating engaging and high-quality notes is essential for driving traffic to your store. The platform provides initial exposure to new notes, but user interaction determines the actual traffic. If users do not click on your note, it won't generate views, regardless of the initial exposure. Therefore, the cover image and product style are critical factors. A compelling cover image can attract users to click on your note, leading to more interactions such as likes, comments, and shares. Understanding this traffic logic helps in creating notes that not only attract initial views but also sustain user engagement over time."

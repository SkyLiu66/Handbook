        "Content": "After posting on Xiaohongshu for a while, it is crucial to learn how to use data analysis to identify areas for improvement. By examining interaction data, you can pinpoint which aspects of your posts are weak and focus on enhancing them. To access your data, go to your account and find the 'Professional Account Center' in the upper left corner. Here, you can view data from the past seven days, including the number of post views, profile visits, and new followers. Detailed data is available in three dimensions: post data, follower data, and personal homepage data. Post data includes metrics like transaction data, interaction data (views, likes, comments, and shares), and guidance data (clicks on linked products). Follower data provides insights into the number of followers gained or lost, their interaction levels, and their demographics. Personal homepage data shows how many people visited your profile after viewing your posts. By regularly analyzing these metrics, you can make informed decisions to optimize your content and improve your account's performance."

Additionally, pay attention to follower data, including the number of new followers, lost followers, and the demographics of your followers. This information is crucial for understanding your audience and tailoring your content to their preferences. Another important metric is the 'click-through rate' for posts with product links, which indicates how many users are interested in the products you promote.

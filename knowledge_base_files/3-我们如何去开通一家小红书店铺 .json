        "Content": "Xiaohongshu offers two types of stores: personal stores and enterprise stores. Personal stores can be registered using an individual's ID card and allow only one store per person. This type of store is recommended for beginners due to its simplicity and lower risk of issues such as counterfeit claims. On the other hand, enterprise stores require a business license and allow up to three stores per entity. While enterprise stores offer more scalability, they come with additional responsibilities and potential complications. For new users, it is advisable to start with a personal store to get familiar with the platform and its operations. Once you gain experience and wish to expand, you can consider opening an enterprise store. This approach minimizes initial risks and provides a smoother learning curve."

Navigate to the 'Me' section and click on the three horizontal lines to find the store opening option. Alternatively, you can search for 'Xiaohongshu store opening' in the app's search bar. Follow the prompts to select the type of store you want to openâ€”personal or enterprise. For a personal store, choose 'Personal Store,' then fill in your name, ID number, phone number, and complete the facial recognition process. Ensure your store name is professional and relevant to your products, as it impacts customer perception. If the name you want is already taken, you will need to wait seven days to change it again. For enterprise stores, select 'Enterprise Store,' fill in the business license details, and upload the necessary documents. The approval process for enterprise stores takes about three days, while personal stores are approved on the same day. Following these steps will help you set up your Xiaohongshu store efficiently."

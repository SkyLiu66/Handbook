        "Content": "Monetization on Xiaohongshu fundamentally relies on traffic. The more traffic your account generates, the higher the chances of attracting businesses and customers. This increased visibility can lead to more sales and advertising opportunities. Many users struggle with low traffic despite their efforts in creating content. This often stems from a self-centered approach, where content is created based on personal preferences rather than audience interests. To boost traffic, it's essential to focus on popular and trending topics that resonate with a broader audience. For instance, in the food niche, posting about high-traffic items like 'spicy chicken feet' or 'layered tripe' can attract more viewers compared to less popular items. By aligning your content with what the audience is interested in, you can significantly increase your traffic and, consequently, your monetization potential."

Look at their posts and note which ones have high engagement, such as likes and comments. This can give you insights into what topics or products are currently popular. For example, if you notice that posts about 'peach-themed makeup' or 'relationship advice' are performing well, consider creating similar content. Additionally, focus on addressing common questions or problems your audience faces. This can be done by observing frequently asked questions in your niche or conducting surveys. By providing valuable and relevant content, you can attract more viewers and increase your traffic. Remember, the key is to stay updated with trends and continuously adapt your content strategy to meet audience demands."

Regular updates keep your audience engaged and signal to the platform's algorithm that your account is active, which can lead to better visibility. Aim to post daily or at least several times a week. This can be challenging, especially for new creators, but it's essential for building momentum. One strategy is to create a content calendar and plan your posts in advance. This helps ensure a steady flow of content and reduces the stress of last-minute creation. Additionally, consider creating series or themed content that encourages viewers to return for the next installment. For example, a '30-day fitness challenge' or 'weekly skincare tips' can keep your audience engaged over a longer period. By maintaining a consistent posting schedule, you can build a loyal following and sustain high traffic levels."

        "Content": "Proper positioning and flexibility are crucial when starting on Xiaohongshu. Many users make the mistake of setting a rigid framework by choosing a name and avatar before understanding their niche. This can lead to frustration and abandonment if the chosen niche does not yield the desired results. Instead, it is recommended to first explore different niches by posting content and observing the response. If a niche does not work, it is easier to pivot and try another one without being constrained by initial choices. This approach allows for better adaptability and reduces the risk of early burnout. Maintaining a flexible mindset and being open to change can significantly enhance the chances of success on the platform."

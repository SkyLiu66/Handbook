And the beauty industry has traditionally been male-dominated, especially the corporate boardrooms. Things are definitely changing. More and more women are getting a seat at the table. And with the new entrepreneurs, the new beauty entrepreneurs, all the new brands that are coming up, there's so many women. And for me, I'm really lucky because I had the experience of being in corporate America. I've had the experience of being freelance. I've had the experience of having a very big, giant network to help me do whatever I needed. And now I'm back again being an entrepreneur. And being in charge again. And I'm really excited because things have changed. And it's an opportunity to do things different. I work with a lot of founders of brands. I have a lot of incredibly successful founders where we talk about everything from what it's like being a working mom to, you know, what it's like when you don't have enough money to grow your business. Everyone has different situations. So it's interesting to me. I'm really lucky to hear about them and to help. I mean, some of the challenges I have had being a businesswoman is a combination of do I go to a business meeting or do I go to a family event? Do I go to a business meeting or do I take a job for a magazine that I want to do? So, yes, there's always choices. There's no sense regretting what is in the past. I made my choices. I think I only miss one of my kids' sing-alongs all year. All of those years. And my advice to working moms, be really nice to the principal. Get them on your calendar what days the back-to-school night is, the things that are really important. And try not to plan a trip around that time. So try to be a little bit in control of the things that are really important. I did that. And I'm really grateful I did. You know, I remember when I literally had to choose between my family and something cool. I was doing, this is a crazy true story. I was doing a cover of Cosmopolitan. And my husband said, I'll come in with the baby when you're done. I said, great, meet me. We didn't have cell phones. Dressed Dylan in a striped blue shirt. My husband was wearing, I think, a Brooks Brothers striped shirt. And he met me at Scavullo's studio. And Scavullo, ten minutes before, said, hey, we're going out for dinner and drinks with Jean Paul Gaultier. Would you like to come? And I was like, oh, my God, yes. But my husband was coming in. I couldn't call him. He walked in the studio. Jean Paul Gaultier walked in the studio. And being a visual person, my husband in a striped shirt with the baby in the striped shirt. Jean Paul Gaultier in his striped shirt. And I remember looking and saying, pick a door. I went with my husband and the baby. Yeah. It felt like I was living, not even dying, but like osteopathy. Played Shakespeare for Así. Ah, yes. No question. That, in this way. I feel so happy that 어쨌든 of the three of them and Ana down that it Episode 35 of their collection, I also think that it was a very meaningful day together that I could then see them ultimately and they have to also kind of roll with the punches because it's not all like this. It's all over the place. And sometimes there's stressful times where the entrepreneur might lose their cool and you've got to be there to see how you could support them and not take things too personally. But I personally, when I build a team, besides I like to hire people that I would actually love to go out to dinner with, I also look for people that aren't afraid to try things they've never done before. Just because they don't have experience doing it doesn't mean they're not good at it. So I guess my management style is to hire people who are quick, understand things, hardworking, and just able to do a lot of things. Don't just stay in your lane is what I'm saying. When you work for a corporation, you are hired to stay in your lane. When you work for a company, when you work for a startup, you're going to have a lot of lanes. So I actually hope that I hire people around me who are trying things that they have never done before. I really believe that most people need a lot of experience. A lot of kids come to me, they have an idea, they want to start a company, they want to do this. First of all, you have an idea that's great, you have an idea that's going to work, and you have an idea that's great. Don't just call me and tell me the idea. Show me what you're doing. I don't want to see the paper of what your idea is. I want to see what the product is, especially if it's a product. But also my advice is you can't imagine how much you learn working for a company. I don't care if you're a receptionist in a big company. You still learn things. You meet people. You start your network. So definitely, even if you want to start your own business, go take a job. See how people actually work. And also, it shows you maybe that's not what you want to do. And by the way, not everyone is meant to be an entrepreneur. And for most of us entrepreneurs, if it weren't for people that were not really made out to be entrepreneurs, we wouldn't have a business. Because us entrepreneurs are not good at everything. The trick is you need a team, and the right team will help you do whatever you want, and you can't do it by yourself. I don't know why people think building a brand should be quick, should be easy. You should take someone else's money and just do it quickly so you could scale. Guess what? Building a brand takes time. It's like building a family. It takes time. You've got to nurture it. You've got to make sure it's right. And it's not an overnight thing. I'm always encouraging people, if there's something you love and something you're really good at, what could you make that could be better than what's out there? And all you need to do to start a business is find someone to buy what you have to sell. And if you think about it, someone once had the idea of making a string to attach to a tea bag so people could dip. Okay? Someone had that idea. Made millions. And that's how you become an entrepreneur. You never know what idea you have that could work. So my advice for entrepreneurs is figure things out, try things. Don't go broke. You have to be really careful. And just know that it's possible if you have something different and special, you have to start it somewhere. And just make it and see what people like. That's how you become an entrepreneur. This is Biçe. See more pictures on the YouTube channel. Click the subscribe button. Ge 어머니",

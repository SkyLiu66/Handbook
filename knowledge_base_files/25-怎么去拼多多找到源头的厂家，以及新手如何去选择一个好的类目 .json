Therefore, women's clothing is a top choice due to its high traffic. Other viable categories include children's clothing, accessories, and aesthetically pleasing household items like phone cases and stylish water bottles. However, categories with high traffic but low conversion rates, such as toys and plush dolls, are less recommended.

        "Content": "When creating a Xiaohongshu post, sourcing high-quality product images is crucial. Start by identifying the product you want to feature and take a screenshot. Use the image search function on platforms like Taobao to find similar products. Focus on images that are high-resolution and visually appealing. Check the product's main images and details page, but don't overlook the customer review section, as it often contains user-generated content that can be very useful. Save any suitable images you find, as these can be reused for future posts. The key is to gather a variety of images that showcase the product from different angles and in different contexts. This will make your post more engaging and informative for your audience."

        "Content": "The cover image of your Xiaohongshu post is the first thing users see, so it needs to be eye-catching and relevant. Use tools like Meitu Xiuxiu to create a composite image that combines multiple photos. For example, you can use a combination of a product's flat lay and a model wearing the product. Ensure that the images are well-aligned and aesthetically pleasing. You can also use features like horizontal flipping and zooming to make the images look different from their original versions, which helps in avoiding content duplication issues. Additionally, consider using the 'seamless mode' in your editing tool to remove any borders between the images, making the composite look more professional. The goal is to create a cover image that not only attracts attention but also clearly represents the content of your post."

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu has specific image ratio requirements, typically 3:4, which you need to adhere to for optimal display. After creating your composite image, use the editing tools to adjust the image ratio. In Meitu Xiuxiu, you can select the 3:4 ratio to see how your image fits. If the image gets distorted or important elements are cut off, you may need to readjust the composition. This might involve zooming in or out, or repositioning elements within the image. Ensuring that your images meet the platform's ratio requirements is essential for maintaining a professional appearance and maximizing engagement. Always preview your images in the Xiaohongshu app to make sure they look good in the feed and on the post page."

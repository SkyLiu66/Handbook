If you have a knack for selecting products, you might want to sell cosmetics, skincare products, bags, shoes, false eyelashes, or wigs. These categories have a high potential on Xiaohongshu, as over 70% of its user base is female. Second, leverage your existing resources.

If you often spot trending products on platforms like Douyin or Xiaohongshu, take screenshots of these products and search for similar items on 1688 or Pinduoduo. Add these items to your store to capitalize on their popularity. By following these approaches, you can find a suitable category that aligns with your strengths and market demand."

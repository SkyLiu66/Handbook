        "Content": "Selecting products on Xiaohongshu involves two main strategies: intercepting traffic and leveraging low-follower viral posts. Intercepting traffic means identifying popular products and offering them at a slightly lower price. For example, if a competitor is selling a product for 199 yuan with a 50% profit margin, you can sell a similar product for 150 yuan with a lower profit margin. This strategy attracts more customers to your store by offering a better deal. The second strategy involves finding low-follower accounts that have created viral posts. These accounts often have only a few hundred followers but manage to generate thousands of sales. By identifying these products and sourcing them from platforms like 1688, you can capitalize on their popularity. Both strategies require careful observation and analysis of the market trends within Xiaohongshu."

        "Content": "When searching for high-quality image materials, it's crucial to select the right platforms. For instance, images from platforms like Taobao and Xiaohongshu generally have a more polished and professional look compared to those from Pinduoduo. The latter often features images with poor lighting, cluttered backgrounds, and an overall lack of sophistication. To ensure your images meet high standards, avoid using sources known for lower-quality visuals. Instead, focus on platforms that consistently provide well-composed, brightly lit, and aesthetically pleasing images. This practice will enhance the overall quality and appeal of your content."

Usable images should have a clean, uncluttered background, good lighting, and a professional appearance. Avoid images that are blurry, poorly lit, or have too many distracting elements. For example, images with excessive text, stickers, or overly edited features are generally not suitable. Instead, look for images that are simple, elegant, and convey a sense of quality. Practicing this discernment will help you quickly identify which images can enhance your content and which ones should be avoided."

Consistency in editing style is also important to create a cohesive look across all your content. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your images remain high-quality and visually appealing, contributing positively to your overall content strategy."

        "Content": "Choosing the right image size and aspect ratio is crucial for maximizing engagement on social media platforms. For instance, using a 3:4 aspect ratio is often recommended as it provides a balanced and visually appealing layout. This ratio works well for both comparison images and standalone pictures. When creating a cover image, consider using a smaller real-person image alongside a larger drawn or product image. This approach helps to highlight the main subject while still providing context. Additionally, ensure that the images are clear and high-quality to avoid any loss of detail during compression. If you are using someone else's image, always seek permission beforehand. By optimizing image sizes and maintaining high quality, you can significantly improve the performance of your posts."

        "Content": "Using contrast images in your cover design can greatly enhance the visual appeal and effectiveness of your posts. Contrast images, such as before-and-after comparisons, attract more attention and clicks. On platforms like Xiaohongshu, covers with contrast images tend to perform better than simple product displays. To create an effective contrast image, use a photo editing tool to combine two images, ensuring they are aligned and balanced. Add text to clarify the comparison, such as 'Before' and 'After'. This not only makes the cover more informative but also increases its click-through rate. Remember to keep the cover clean and harmonious in color to make it visually appealing. By incorporating contrast images, you can make your covers more engaging and effective."

Images that are too compressed or low in quality can negatively impact the perceived value of your content. To avoid this, always use high-resolution images and minimize compression during the editing process. If you need to transfer images between devices, use methods that preserve quality, such as email or cloud storage, instead of messaging apps that compress files. Additionally, consider uploading images directly from a computer to avoid multiple rounds of compression. By ensuring your images are clear and high-quality, you can enhance the overall performance and engagement of your posts."

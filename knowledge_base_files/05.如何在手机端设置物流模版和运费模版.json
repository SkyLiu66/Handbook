Once logged in, navigate to 'All Tools' and select 'Logistics Settings.' Here, you can create a logistics template, which is essential for listing products. For example, if you are listing women's high-heeled sandals, you would create a logistics template by adding the product name, shipping address, and contact information. The shipping address can be a general location, such as a specific area in Guangdong. After filling in the necessary details, save the template.

In the Xiaohongshu merchant app, go to 'Logistics Settings' and select 'Add Shipping Fee Template.' Name the template according to the product, such as 'Women's High-Heeled Sandals.' For the fee type, you can choose 'Seller Bears Shipping Cost,' which is common for most products. However, for regions like Xinjiang and Tibet, where shipping might not be available, additional settings are required. These specific settings can only be configured on the desktop version of the app. By setting up shipping fee templates, you ensure that your shipping costs are accurately reflected when customers purchase your products."

Without these templates, you cannot complete the product listing process. The logistics template includes details like the product name, shipping address, and contact information, ensuring that your products are shipped from the correct location. The shipping fee template specifies who bears the shipping cost, which is typically the seller. However, for certain regions, additional settings might be required. By preparing these templates in advance, you streamline the listing process and ensure that all necessary information is in place, leading to a better customer experience and efficient order fulfillment."

            "Content": "To create an effective live stream script, follow a structured approach. Start with a theme introduction, explaining the main topic and the value viewers will gain. Next, introduce yourself briefly, highlighting your expertise and experience. Then, move into the main content, which can include valuable information, stories, or discussions. Finally, introduce your products and make sales pitches. Throughout the stream, incorporate interactive elements such as asking for likes, comments, and shares to keep the audience engaged. Use a 20-30 minute cycle for your script to accommodate new viewers and maintain interest. This structured approach ensures that your live stream is engaging, informative, and effective in driving sales."

            "Content": "When preparing your live stream script, balance detail and flexibility. Start with a framework that includes key talking points and important phrases. Test this approach in one or two sessions to see if it works for you. If it doesn't, consider writing a more detailed script. Some people perform better with a detailed script, while others prefer the flexibility of a framework. Avoid making the script too rigid; live streams should be dynamic and responsive to audience interactions. Important phrases can be detailed, but allow room for spontaneous engagement based on viewer comments and questions. This balance ensures that your live stream remains authentic and engaging while covering all necessary points."

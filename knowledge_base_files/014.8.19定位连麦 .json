        "Content": "Identifying your core product and target audience is essential for effective content creation and marketing. If your primary product is teaching professionals how to create and sell knowledge-based courses, you need to focus on this core offering. Start by listing the main pain points your target audience faces, such as lack of course creation skills or difficulties in marketing their courses. Use these pain points to create targeted content that addresses these issues. For example, if your audience struggles with creating course outlines, you can create content that provides step-by-step guides on how to structure a course. By focusing on your core product and the specific needs of your target audience, you can create more relevant and engaging content that drives conversions."

Look for accounts with similar target audiences and analyze their content, engagement rates, and follower demographics. Identify the types of content that perform well and consider how you can incorporate similar elements into your strategy. For example, if you notice that posts about career transition tips receive high engagement, you might want to create similar content. Additionally, consider the format of the content—whether it's text, video, or a combination of both—and choose the one that best suits your style and audience preferences."

        "Content": "Balancing professional content with personal branding can help create a more relatable and engaging presence. While your primary focus should be on delivering valuable content related to your core product, adding a personal touch can make your brand more relatable. For instance, if you are teaching course creation, you can occasionally share behind-the-scenes content or personal stories related to your journey in course creation. However, it's important to maintain a balance. In the initial stages, keep personal content to about 10% of your total content to ensure that your primary message remains clear. As your audience grows and becomes more engaged, you can gradually increase the amount of personal content to build a stronger connection with your audience."

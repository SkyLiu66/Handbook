        "Content": "Diverting traffic from Xiaohongshu to other platforms must be done carefully to avoid violations. One effective method is using a secondary account to interact with users and subtly guide them to the main account or external platforms. Another approach is to use images with embedded contact information, ensuring that the text is not easily detectable by automated systems. Users can also leverage the platform's group chat feature to create a community and share information more freely. It's important to avoid direct mentions of other platforms or explicit calls to action that could be flagged by Xiaohongshu's monitoring systems. By using these methods, users can safely build a following and direct traffic without risking account suspension or content restrictions."

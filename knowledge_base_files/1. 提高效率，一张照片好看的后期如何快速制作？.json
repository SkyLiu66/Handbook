        "Content": "In Meitu Xiuxiu, several basic editing tools are essential for enhancing your photos. The 'Edit' tool allows you to crop and rotate your images, which is useful if your composition is off or if there are unwanted elements at the edges. The 'Brightness' tool, also known as exposure, helps to brighten the entire image. 'Contrast' can be adjusted to make the subject stand out, especially if the image appears dull or hazy. 'Highlights' and 'Shadows' are used to adjust the brightest and darkest parts of the image, respectively. These tools are crucial for correcting lighting issues and improving the overall look of your photos."

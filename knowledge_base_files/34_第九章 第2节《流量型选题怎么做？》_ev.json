        "Content": "Content aimed at generating traffic on Xiaohongshu can be categorized into three main types: viral content, trending topics, and compilations. Viral content includes topics that are popular within the industry and have high engagement rates. These can be identified by looking at posts that have significantly higher likes and shares compared to others. Trending topics involve leveraging current events, celebrity news, or seasonal trends to attract attention. For example, associating content with a popular celebrity or a recent event can significantly boost visibility. Compilations, on the other hand, involve creating lists or collections of related items, such as recommended apps, books, or products. These types of posts are particularly effective because they provide value to the audience by offering curated recommendations. In the early stages of account growth, it is advisable to focus heavily on traffic-generating content, which can constitute up to 80-90% of your posts. As the account stabilizes, this can be reduced to around 40-50%."

        "Content": "Identifying viral content involves several strategies. One effective method is to observe industry trends and see which topics consistently perform well. This can be done by following key accounts and noting which of their posts receive the most engagement. Another method is to use keyword searches related to your industry to find popular posts. For example, searching for common terms in your niche and looking at the top results can provide insights into what content resonates with the audience. Additionally, exploring hashtags and topics that frequently appear in viral posts can help you identify potential content ideas. Tools like Xiaohongshu's discovery page can also be useful; by engaging with multiple posts, the algorithm will start showing you more of the same type, making it easier to spot trends. Lastly, looking at the performance of similar accounts, especially those slightly ahead in growth, can offer valuable clues. By employing these methods, you can consistently find and create content that has a high potential to go viral."

        "Content": "Leveraging trending topics and creating compilations are effective strategies for maintaining high engagement on Xiaohongshu. Trending topics can be identified by keeping an eye on current events, celebrity news, and seasonal trends. For instance, if a celebrity is in the news for a particular reason, creating content related to that event can attract significant attention. Similarly, seasonal trends like holidays or festivals provide opportunities to create timely and relevant content. Compilations, such as lists of recommended apps, books, or products, are also highly engaging. These posts offer value by curating useful information for the audience. For example, a post listing the top five apps for new mothers or the best books for improving financial literacy can attract a lot of interest. These types of posts are particularly useful in the early stages of account growth, as they do not require extensive content creation skills but can still drive significant traffic. By regularly incorporating trending topics and compilations into your content strategy, you can maintain high levels of engagement and attract a broader audience."

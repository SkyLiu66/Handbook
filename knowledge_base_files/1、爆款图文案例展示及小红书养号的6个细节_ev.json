        "Content": "Proper account maintenance is crucial for success on Xiaohongshu. New accounts should be handled with care to avoid being flagged by the platform's algorithms. It's recommended to use new accounts that haven't posted any content before, as they receive initial support from the platform. Avoid posting content from multiple accounts in the same location to prevent being flagged. Using different networks or VPNs can help simulate different locations. For the first four days, refrain from posting any content. Instead, focus on browsing, liking, saving, and interacting with other users' content. This helps establish your account as a genuine user. On the fifth day, you can update your profile information, but wait at least an hour before posting any content to give the platform time to process the changes. Additionally, spend at least 40 minutes daily on the platform, engaging with content in a natural manner. This helps build a normal user profile and reduces the risk of being flagged. By following these best practices, you can maintain a healthy account and improve your chances of success on Xiaohongshu."

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu offers two main types of stores: personal stores and enterprise stores. A personal store is ideal for individuals starting with zero cost. It requires only an ID card for setup and is perfect for testing the waters with minimal financial risk. On the other hand, an enterprise store requires a business license and can manage up to three Xiaohongshu accounts under one store. This setup is advantageous for businesses looking to scale operations and manage multiple accounts efficiently. Enterprise stores also offer more robust features and are less prone to violations, making them suitable for established businesses. It is recommended to start with a personal store to minimize initial costs and then transition to an enterprise store as your business grows."

        "Content": "To create diverse Xiaohongshu notes based on different product categories, start by analyzing the types of notes your competitors are posting. For example, if you are selling innerwear, health teas, or women's shoes, observe how other sellers in these categories structure their notes. Typically, notes can include images, videos, or a mix of both. For innerwear, you might find that video content showcasing the product's fit and comfort performs well. For health teas, combining product images with informative content about the benefits of the tea can be effective. Women's shoes might benefit from videos that highlight the design and comfort of the shoes. By studying successful notes in your category, you can identify patterns and preferences that resonate with your target audience. This approach allows you to create engaging and relevant content that can attract more viewers and potential buyers."

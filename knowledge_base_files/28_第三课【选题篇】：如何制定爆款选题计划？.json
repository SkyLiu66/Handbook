        "Content": "Utilizing marketing tools effectively can significantly boost your sales. Implementing promotions such as discounts, coupons, and bulk purchase incentives can stimulate customer purchases. Access these tools through the 'All Tools' section in the merchant app. For instance, you can create store-wide coupons or specific product discounts to attract new customers. Offering discounts to new users can also encourage them to make their first purchase. Additionally, setting up trust coupons for your store can enhance customer confidence and drive sales. Regularly updating and managing these promotional tools can lead to a substantial increase in order volume. Ensure that your marketing strategies are aligned with your overall business goals to maximize their effectiveness."

        "Content": "When fulfilling orders, it's crucial to ensure seamless delivery to avoid customer dissatisfaction and returns. Firstly, avoid including any promotional cards or feedback request cards in the packaging, as these often contain branding that might not be favorable. If customers receive such items, they may realize the product is from a platform they didn't expect and request a refund or leave negative feedback. Always communicate with the supplier to ensure 'no-trace' shipping, meaning no branding or promotional materials are included. If a supplier cannot guarantee this, find another who can. This practice helps maintain a high order completion rate and positive reviews, which are essential for the growth and reputation of your store."

        "Content": "Effective customer service management is vital for maintaining customer satisfaction and ensuring repeat business. It is recommended to use a dedicated customer service team rather than relying on the platform's official customer service. This allows for more personalized and timely responses to customer inquiries. Ensure that your response rate is above 80%, as this significantly impacts customer satisfaction and your store's reputation. Download the merchant app to manage customer interactions efficiently. This app provides a comprehensive backend where you can monitor orders, handle after-sales service, and manage financial transactions. Set up notifications on your phone to alert you of new messages, ensuring you never miss an important customer inquiry. By managing customer service effectively, you can build trust and loyalty among your customers."

        "Content": "When posting on Xiaohongshu, it's crucial to use the right methods to maximize traffic and visibility. Instead of using the direct 'plus' button at the bottom center of the app, consider posting through the 'Creative Inspiration' section or the merchant backend, especially in areas marked as 'high demand for notes.' These sections often offer traffic incentives, such as flow coupons, which can significantly boost your post's visibility. Additionally, participating in Xiaohongshu's promotional activities can help you gain more exposure. Regular posting is also essential; aim to post three to five notes daily. However, avoid posting too frequently or within short intervals, as this can lead to your account being flagged as a marketing account and restricted. Utilize the scheduled posting feature to plan your posts at optimal times, such as noon, late afternoon, and evening, to reach a broader audience."

        "Content": "Monitoring the performance of your posts on Xiaohongshu is vital for continuous improvement. Pay attention to the 'small eyes' metric, which indicates the number of views. If your posts consistently receive fewer than 100 views, it may indicate that the content lacks appeal or is being restricted. In such cases, consider changing the product or content strategy. A view count between 100 and 500 is considered normal, while over 500 views suggest that your content is performing well. For high-performing posts, keep the same cover image but vary the content to maintain interest. This could involve changing the text, images, or videos while keeping the engaging cover image. This strategy helps in leveraging the initial success while providing fresh content to your audience."

        "Content": "Creating engaging content on Xiaohongshu involves sourcing high-quality materials and repurposing them effectively. Platforms like Pinduoduo, Taobao, and 1688 offer valuable resources such as buyer reviews and images that can be used for content creation. When using these resources, ensure to perform secondary creation to avoid issues with originality and potential copyright claims. For video content, platforms like Douyin (TikTok) can be useful. Use the search function to find relevant videos and images that can be repurposed. Always aim to add your unique touch to the content to make it stand out. This approach not only helps in maintaining originality but also enhances the appeal of your posts. Regularly updating and varying your content keeps your audience engaged and encourages more interactions."

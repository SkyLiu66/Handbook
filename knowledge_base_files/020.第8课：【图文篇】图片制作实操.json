Even if you know the exact settings and filters used by professionals, replicating their work is challenging due to varying shooting conditions. The key to improving your photography skills is to practice extensively. Look at thousands of good photos, collect hundreds of them, and practice shooting from different angles. The core message is to practice and observe diligently."

            "Content": "Before shooting, ensure that the elements in your scene are well-designed. For example, in food photography, the presentation and color coordination of the food are crucial. Avoid using plain white rice; instead, use colorful ingredients like purple rice or pasta with vibrant vegetables. The overall color scheme and style should be consistent. For image dimensions, use a 3:4 vertical format for better visual impact in information streams. Place the main subject in the center of the frame and consider any potential viral elements that could attract viewers."

            "Content": "Use clean backgrounds and focus on the main subject. For example, when photographing a desk setup, place the items you want to highlight in the center. Consider the 'rule of thirds' for composition, but remember that practice is more important than theoretical knowledge. Capture different angles and take multiple shots to find the best one. Highlight the most attractive elements to draw viewers' attention. For example, in food photography, make the food look appetizing and use filters to enhance its appeal."

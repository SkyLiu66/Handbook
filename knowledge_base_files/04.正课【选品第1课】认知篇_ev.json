            "Content": "Hello everyone, today we will start with the topic of product selection. I've mentioned many times that product selection is crucial in e-commerce. Whether you are on Xiaohongshu, Douyin, Taobao, or any other platform, if you don't know how to select products, the difficulty level of your work will increase significantly. To make money on e-commerce platforms, whether through live streaming or selling products, you need to have a product selection mindset. This session will be divided into four parts. First, we will discuss some basic concepts. I've always emphasized that understanding the fundamentals is essential. If you find some concepts hard to grasp initially, don't worry. Just start working on them, and over time, you will have moments of realization. Remember, the key to product selection is understanding the underlying logic of e-commerce: people, products, and scenarios. This logic applies to both online and offline businesses. By understanding this, you will know where to focus your efforts."

            "Keywords": ["consumer perspective", "product selection", "e-commerce"],
            "Content": "The second key idea is the importance of adopting a consumer perspective when selecting products. It's not just about what you like; it's about what the consumers like. You need to understand the data, see what products are trending, and observe what your competitors are doing. For example, if a particular product is trending on Xiaohongshu, it's because the platform has identified that many users are interested in it. Therefore, the platform will prioritize giving traffic to that product. As a seller, you need to align with this logic. Your personal preferences are secondary to what the market demands. By focusing on consumer preferences and market trends, you can select products that are more likely to succeed. This approach ensures that you are not just relying on luck but making informed decisions based on data and consumer behavior."

            "Keywords": ["people-product-scenario", "e-commerce", "framework"],
            "Content": "The third key idea is applying the people-product-scenario framework to your e-commerce strategy. This framework involves understanding who your consumers are (people), what products you are selling (product), and the context in which the transaction occurs (scenario). For instance, on Xiaohongshu, the 'people' are the platform's users, the 'product' is what you are selling, and the 'scenario' is the content format, such as a post or a video. By understanding this framework, you can optimize each element to enhance your sales. For example, creating appealing content that resonates with your target audience can significantly improve your chances of making a sale. Similarly, understanding the platform's algorithm and how it prioritizes content can help you create posts that get more visibility. This holistic approach ensures that all aspects of your e-commerce strategy are aligned and optimized for success."

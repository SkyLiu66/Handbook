Whether you want to do a classic red, a bright pink, or go darker, go down here, I'll show you how to do it right and keep you smiling all day. Andrea has this beautiful pinky in her lip, but there's three colors I would choose between. One of them has a little bit of red in it. Here's one with brown, and here's one that's more purple. So we're going to go with the deepest, because there's something really nice about having just a deep lip with very little else on the face. So the best way to do a lip, because it's not always the easiest, is you start in the middle, blot your lips together, and then you kind of move it around. Now, I do have a lip pencil if I need it. I try to do the lipstick without a lip pencil. And this is one of those things that it does matter. The shape of the lip matters. Now, when you're doing the lip, you don't want to go over the lip, but you want to get the full extent. Women make a mistake when they go over the lip line. It just does not look right. And another common mistake that I have tried to make sure I don't do is when one side kind of goes to a point and the other's rounded. And it's really a preference. And I don't really care which one you do. I am using a brush because this color is not forgiving. Red lipstick, deep dark lipstick, not forgiving. Even when the lipstick is out of the tube, I think the darkest ones are kind of difficult. Make a mistake, which I'm sure I will. You take your cotton swab and you take makeup remover, eye makeup remover, and you just clean it up. So when doing the inner corners, you try to get all the way in. This is definitely one of those things that is not fast. And when someone is lucky enough to have really full lips, and there's almost like a double lip line, you have to make a decision where you stop. Go again like this. Now open your mouth altogether wide. So when you're doing the lips, especially when you're applying it on someone else, you have to make sure you go in the inner corner on both sides, but not going over. Okay. And then look at me for a second. So the top is pretty good. Now what I do when I'm almost done is I always show a mirror. Okay. To the model because sometimes they're really good knowing if that's the right shape. Like, do you like to go down here? Yes. So you go all the way? Here, go ahead. Show me how you do it. I find that lips are very, very personal. Some models and some women, when I do their makeup, there's certain things they like and I let them do it. But I don't like to do it unless it's way off. So you always go to the lower end. Yeah. And then if you do make a mistake, a way to fix it is with a cotton swab. And then you go right back to the foundation and then you just use that almost like an eraser. And that will clean up any kind of mess. Okay. Now, if you are someone that likes to use a pencil, I like to do pencil after the lipstick because then you could look and you could see where it stops and starts. And another great thing when using a pencil, you could fill in the whole lip and adapt the color, make it deeper. And it does keep the lipstick on longer. The pencil is a waxier base. And then it's up to you. If you want to use a lip that has a little bit of different texture on the inside. So this is, I love this because it just brings the natural pinky out of her bottom lip without changing anything. I think it looks really, really cool and pretty. I love this color and I chose this color because the depth of her lips I thought would look so good with this tint. I thought would look so good with this tone instead of going with one of the redder colors or the, or the browner color. I happen to love a blue tone lipstick because I think we all have natural blue tones in our lips. And certainly she would look as gorgeous in a bright red lipstick. She would look as gorgeous if she wore a clear gloss. So I love the fact that she's got brows on, she's got a little bit of concealer foundation, but basically she looks beautiful. Basically she looks very chic and gorgeous and not overdone. So it's an option. So when you're done with the lip, then you go back and look at the foundation, look and see if there's anything to fix. And you just could use a sponge. Probably the best at this is a sponge. It will get the spots and then you'll go back with powder. And I don't know why, but I think the plum has really made her eyes pop. It's almost like there's blue inside. And I really love it. I'm going to give a little bit of powder. And then I'm going to take a little bit of powder. I'm going to take a little bit of powder. And I'm going to take a little bit of powder. And then I'm going to take a little bit of powder. I don't want to take away most of the shine because it gives a nice glow, but you take it away around the nose, around the mouth. And I see the most beautiful color in her cheeks. So I'm actually going to just pop it up a bit. It's almost like natural peachy. So I'm going to add a little bit. Just to complete the look. I love it. It looks great. It's kind of ugly, really nice color. And I think that will be enough for the<|jw|> makeup. I'll see you guys in the next video. Until then still, God bless, cowboy. God bless everybody.

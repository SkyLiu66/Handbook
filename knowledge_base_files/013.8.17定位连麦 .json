For instance, if you are targeting professionals with 5-10 years of experience who are considering a career transition, you need to focus on specific issues they face, such as job dissatisfaction, career growth, and work-life balance. Start by listing 20-30 pain points that your target audience might have. Use these keywords to search for similar content on platforms like Xiaohongshu. This will help you understand what kind of content resonates with your audience and how to position your content to address their needs effectively."

The goal is to find a balance between consistency and adaptability to ensure sustained audience growth and engagement."

        "Content": "Pinduoduo is known for its low prices and a mix of product quality, similar to a street market. The platform's primary characteristic is its affordability, with prices generally lower than other e-commerce platforms. However, this often comes at the cost of product quality. Another notable feature is the prevalence of fake sales numbers, as sellers can manipulate sales figures through backend operations. Therefore, when selecting products on Pinduoduo, it's crucial to be vigilant and discerning. Despite the potential for fake sales, products with genuinely high sales figures are likely to be of acceptable quality. It's advisable to use Pinduoduo as a last resort for product selection, after exploring options on platforms like Taobao, Tmall, and Xiaohongshu."

        "Content": "There are two primary methods for selecting products on Pinduoduo. The first method involves using the '9.9 Special Sale' section, which features low-priced items often sold at a loss by manufacturers to boost sales. Look for products with high sales and a good sales-to-review ratio, ideally around 10:1. Check the latest reviews to ensure authenticity and quality. The second method involves using the platform's category rankings. Start by selecting a broad category, such as food or clothing, and then narrow it down to subcategories. Avoid products with brand logos to prevent copyright issues. Save product images and details using software tools, ensuring no Pinduoduo-specific markings are present. Evaluate the product's reviews and ratings, aiming for a high percentage of positive feedback."

        "Content": "Evaluating product reviews and ratings is essential when selecting products on Pinduoduo. Start by examining the sales-to-review ratio, which should ideally be around 10:1. This means for every 10 products sold, there should be at least one review. A high ratio indicates genuine sales and customer feedback. Next, check the overall positive review rate, aiming for at least 85% on Pinduoduo, as this is considered good for the platform. Read the latest reviews to get an accurate picture of the product's quality and customer satisfaction. Look for detailed reviews with images, as these are more likely to be genuine. Avoid products with a high number of negative reviews or those with consistent complaints about quality. By carefully evaluating reviews and ratings, you can make informed decisions and select reliable products for your store."

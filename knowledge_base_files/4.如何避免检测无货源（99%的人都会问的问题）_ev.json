        "Content": "To avoid detection of no-inventory e-commerce accounts on platforms like Xiaohongshu, it is essential to understand the reasons behind such detections. One primary reason is the reuse of tracking numbers. If you use tracking numbers generated by other platforms, such as Pinduoduo, and apply them to Xiaohongshu, the system can detect this inconsistency. Each platform has its own tracking system, and using a tracking number from another platform can raise red flags. Another reason for detection is buyer reports. If a buyer receives a package with a Pinduoduo logo or a promotional card from a Pinduoduo store, they might report it, leading to your account being flagged for no-inventory practices. Understanding these reasons helps in taking preventive measures to avoid detection."

        "Content": "To avoid detection of no-inventory accounts, one effective method is to establish direct relationships with manufacturers and suppliers. Platforms like 1688 and Alibaba are excellent sources for finding suppliers who can provide direct shipping services. When communicating with suppliers, clearly state that you are operating on Xiaohongshu and inquire if they offer one-click shipping services. Most suppliers are willing to accommodate such requests. Additionally, using pre-prepared communication scripts can streamline the process of establishing these relationships. These scripts can be found in dedicated support groups or forums. By ensuring that your suppliers can handle direct shipping, you minimize the risk of detection due to reused tracking numbers or buyer reports."

These groups often provide pre-prepared communication scripts that can be used to negotiate with suppliers. For instance, when reaching out to suppliers on platforms like 1688 or Pinduoduo, using a well-crafted script can help you clearly convey your needs and ensure that the supplier understands your requirements for direct shipping. Additionally, these groups can offer advice and share experiences on how to handle common issues related to no-inventory e-commerce. By leveraging the collective knowledge and resources available in these support groups, you can enhance your communication with suppliers and reduce the risk of detection on platforms like Xiaohongshu."

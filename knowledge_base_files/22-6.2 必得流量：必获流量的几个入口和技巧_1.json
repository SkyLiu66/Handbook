        "Content": "Xiaohongshu's traffic characteristics differ significantly from platforms like Douyin. On Douyin, the performance of a post is usually determined within 24 to 48 hours. However, on Xiaohongshu, a post's visibility can increase gradually over time. This means that even if a post doesn't gain much traction initially, it can still receive continuous exposure if the content is high-quality. Therefore, it's crucial not to judge a post's success solely based on its performance within the first 48 hours. Additionally, Xiaohongshu has a precise search traffic system. If your post contains accurate keywords and high-interest topics, it can appear in search results long after it was initially posted, providing ongoing traffic. Lastly, Xiaohongshu benefits from long-tail traffic, meaning a successful post can continue to attract views, comments, and shares for months or even years. Understanding these characteristics allows content creators to focus on producing high-quality content without being overly concerned about immediate results."

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu offers several tools to help new users gain additional traffic. One such tool is the 'Traffic Boost Coupon,' available in the 'Growth Boost' section under the 'Creation Center.' New users should regularly check this section to ensure they don't miss out on these coupons, which can significantly increase a post's exposure. After using a traffic boost coupon, users can monitor its effectiveness in the 'My Promotion' section. However, it's important to note that if the content quality is not high, the platform may stop promoting the post even if the coupon's exposure limit hasn't been reached. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that the post's cover, title, and content are engaging. Additionally, users should not wait until the last day to use their coupons, as the platform's reward pool may be depleted, resulting in insufficient traffic. By understanding and effectively utilizing these tools, users can maximize their posts' visibility and reach."

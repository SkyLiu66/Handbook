        "Content": "Xiaohongshu's traffic recommendation mechanism is designed to promote content to users who are most likely to be interested in it. The platform uses algorithms to analyze user behavior and content tags to match posts with the right audience. Initially, new accounts may experience a 'cold start' period where their content receives limited visibility. During this phase, the platform is assessing the account and its content to understand its niche and target audience. To navigate this period successfully, focus on creating high-quality, niche-specific content. Avoid activities like mutual following or buying likes and followers, as these can lead to penalties. Instead, engage with the platform naturally by viewing content, searching for interests, and making purchases. This helps the algorithm understand your user tags and recommend your content to the right audience. Over time, as your account gains more engagement, the platform will start promoting your content to a broader audience, increasing your visibility and potential for growth."

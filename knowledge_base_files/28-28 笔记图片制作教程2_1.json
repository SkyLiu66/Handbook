        "Content": "When creating images for social media platforms like Xiaohongshu, it's essential to adjust the image proportions to fit the platform's requirements. For instance, Xiaohongshu uses a 3:4 ratio. To achieve this, you can use image editing tools like Meitu Xiuxiu. First, open the image in the editor and select the 'Adjust' option to set the ratio to 3:4. If the image doesn't fit well, you can use the 'Background' option to add a background that matches the 3:4 ratio. This ensures that the main content of the image remains centered and visually appealing. Additionally, you can adjust the background color to match the overall theme of the image. This process helps in maintaining the visual integrity of the image while adhering to the platform's specifications."

        "Content": "Text plays a crucial role in social media images, especially on platforms like Xiaohongshu. Users often focus on the text within the image rather than the accompanying description. Therefore, it's essential to include clear and compelling text on your images. Avoid using prohibited words to prevent your content from being flagged. Use image editing tools to add text that is visually appealing and easy to read. You can choose different fonts, colors, and styles to make the text stand out. Additionally, adding small icons or emojis can make the text more engaging. Ensure that the text conveys the key message succinctly and aligns with the overall theme of the image. This approach not only enhances the visual appeal of your content but also increases the likelihood of user engagement and interaction."

        "Content": "Centering and aligning text in images is vital for creating visually balanced content. When adding text to an image, use the alignment tools available in your image editor. For instance, Meitu Xiuxiu provides guidelines that help you center the text both horizontally and vertically. As you move the text, look for red lines that indicate the text is centered. This ensures that the text is evenly distributed and visually appealing. Additionally, you can adjust the text size and position to fit the image's layout. If the background color makes the text hard to read, consider adding a border or shadow to the text. This enhances readability and ensures that the text stands out against the background. By following these techniques, you can create well-aligned and visually appealing images that effectively convey your message."

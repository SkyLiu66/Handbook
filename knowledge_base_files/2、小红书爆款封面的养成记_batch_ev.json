        "Content": "Creating an effective cover for your Xiaohongshu posts is crucial for attracting attention. Unlike product-based accounts that require visually appealing covers, you can use simple and impactful text to create a strong visual and psychological impact. The cover should be straightforward and convey the main message clearly. You can use solid background colors like dark gray or black to maintain a serious tone, especially if your content is related to entrepreneurship or earning money. Avoid using light or playful colors like pink or light green, as they can make your content appear less serious. For lifestyle or fashion content, avoid dark colors that might create discomfort. The key is to match the cover's tone with the content's nature. By focusing on simplicity and clarity, you can create covers that effectively draw in your target audience."

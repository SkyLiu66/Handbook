        "Content": "Building a topic library is essential for maintaining a steady stream of content ideas. Relying solely on inspiration can be inefficient and result in inconsistent content styles, making it difficult to establish a clear personal brand. A topic library helps in organizing both long-term and sudden topics. Long-term topics revolve around the account's persona and provide valuable content to users, such as study tips for students. Sudden topics are based on special events or trending subjects, like holidays or viral moments. To build a topic library, start by identifying your benchmark accounts and analyzing their popular posts. Use platforms like Xiaohongshu to search for relevant keywords and gather data from various sources, including external platforms like Douyin and WeChat. This structured approach ensures that you always have a pool of ideas to draw from, making your content creation process more efficient and aligned with your brand."

        "Content": "Leveraging benchmark accounts is a practical method for generating topic ideas. Start by identifying accounts that align with your niche and have a substantial following. Analyze their popular posts to understand what resonates with their audience. Use the '123 Rule': spend one week consistently engaging with content from similar accounts, dedicate two hours daily to this activity, and perform three actions—like, save, and comment—on their posts. This engagement helps Xiaohongshu's algorithm to recommend more relevant content. Focus on accounts with stable engagement metrics, as they indicate a well-defined audience and high commercial value. Document the successful topics from these accounts in your topic library, including their titles, formats, and presentation styles. This method not only provides a wealth of content ideas but also helps you understand the trends and preferences within your niche, enabling you to create content that is more likely to succeed."

Platforms like ChaMama, Qinggua, and Feigua offer valuable insights into trending topics and popular content. For instance, using HuiTun Data, you can search for keywords related to your niche and filter results based on engagement metrics like saves and likes. This helps in identifying content that has performed well over the past 30 days, providing a reliable basis for your topic selection. While these platforms often require a subscription, they offer a comprehensive view of what works in your niche. Additionally, you can use these platforms to find influencers and benchmark accounts within your niche, further enriching your topic library. By integrating data-driven insights into your content strategy, you can create more targeted and effective content, increasing your chances of engagement and growth on platforms like Xiaohongshu."

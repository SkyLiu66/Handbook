        "Content": "Selecting products on Douyin can be a straightforward process, especially for those looking to sell high-ticket or quality items. Start by determining the type of products you want to sell. Once decided, use Douyin to search for relevant products. For example, if you are interested in accessories, search for terms like 'earrings' or 'necklaces.' Look for accounts that specialize in these products and analyze their content. Focus on accounts that use real-life images and avoid those with real person appearances to prevent copyright issues. Check the prices and sales volume of their products to gauge their popularity. Copy the successful products and their content style, but make sure to modify the names and images to avoid direct copying. This method allows you to leverage existing successful products and content styles without spending too much time on product research."

By using Pinduoduo for product verification, you can confidently select products that are likely to perform well on your platform."

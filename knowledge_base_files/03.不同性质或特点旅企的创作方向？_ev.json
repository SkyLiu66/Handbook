        "Content": "Setting up a professional account on Xiaohongshu offers several benefits, such as displaying a 'Travel Blogger' tag on your profile, which can enhance your credibility and attract more followers. This tag appears below your profile picture and description, making it clear to visitors that you are a travel blogger. To set up a professional account, open the Xiaohongshu app, go to your profile, and click on the three lines in the top left corner. Select 'Creation Center,' then 'More Services,' and finally 'Open Professional Account.' Follow the prompts to enter your personal information and choose your certification type, such as 'Travel Blogger.' While a professional account is beneficial for live streaming and opening a personal store, it is not recommended if you do not have products to sell, as it requires a deposit and is more suitable for tangible goods. Additionally, each ID can only be used for one account, and once verified, it cannot be changed unless you delete the account and start over. Consider your needs carefully before setting up a professional account."

        "Content": "Different types of travel agencies can leverage Xiaohongshu effectively by tailoring their content to their specific strengths. For local travel agencies (地接社), focus on showcasing unique local resources and experiences. Use a 'one chicken, two ways' approach: highlight individual attractions to draw attention and create comprehensive themed tours to offer a complete experience. For example, emphasize unique local activities or partnerships with local businesses. For group travel agencies (组团社) offering mid-to-long trips, use the 'white-cut chicken' method: break down the entire trip into appealing segments and highlight the most attractive parts to entice potential customers. This approach helps avoid overwhelming users with too much information at once. For short trips, focus on high-frequency local consumption, matching customer needs precisely. Highlight seasonal activities, local attractions, and unique experiences that cater to the interests of your target audience. By understanding and addressing the specific needs of different types of travel agencies, you can create engaging and effective content on Xiaohongshu."

        "Content": "Mobile photography and traditional camera photography have distinct differences. Mobile phones, being multifunctional devices, offer convenience but come with limitations in image quality compared to dedicated cameras. Cameras, designed solely for photography, provide superior image quality, depth of field, and color accuracy. To mitigate the limitations of mobile photography, ensure adequate lighting, use portrait mode for background blur, and avoid absolute white backgrounds to prevent exposure issues. Additionally, maintaining a zoom level between 1.5x and 2.0x helps preserve image quality. Understanding these differences and leveraging the strengths of each device can significantly enhance your photography skills."

Avoid using absolute white backgrounds as they can cause exposure issues due to the phone's automatic adjustments. Instead, use darker backgrounds to maintain proper exposure. Keep the zoom level between 1.5x and 2.0x to avoid pixelation and loss of detail. For lighting, use high color rendering index (CRI) lights to accurately capture colors, especially for products like jewelry. These lights help maintain the true color of the subject, which is crucial for product photography. By adhering to these tips, you can significantly improve the quality of your mobile photos."

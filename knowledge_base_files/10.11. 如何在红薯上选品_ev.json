        "Content": "To select products on Xiaohongshu, start by opening the app and using the search bar to look for the product category you are interested in, such as 'phone cases.' After searching, filter the results by selecting 'most popular.' Focus on products that are purely showcased without any promotional links. These products typically have high engagement, such as likes and comments, indicating their popularity. Avoid products promoted by influencers or those with attached purchase links, as these are already heavily marketed. Instead, look for items with high engagement but no direct purchase links. This strategy helps you identify trending products that have not yet saturated the market, giving you a better chance to succeed in selling them."

        "Content": "Once you have identified a trending product on Xiaohongshu, the next step is to source it cost-effectively. Open the Pinduoduo app and use the image search feature to find the same product. This allows you to see the price and availability from various sellers. For example, if a phone case is popular on Xiaohongshu and you find it on Pinduoduo for a low price, you can contact the seller to discuss purchasing options. Request 'no-brand' or 'unbranded' packaging to avoid any conflicts with existing brands. This method ensures you get the product at a competitive price, which you can then sell at a profit."

        "Content": "When selecting products to sell, it's crucial to avoid those that are already saturated in the market. A product is considered saturated if it has high sales numbers, typically over 500 units. Even if a product has high sales, entering a saturated market makes it difficult to compete, especially if your promotional materials are similar to existing ones. Instead, focus on products with high engagement but lower sales numbers. This approach allows you to tap into a market with proven interest but less competition. By doing so, you increase your chances of making successful sales without having to compete with well-established sellers."

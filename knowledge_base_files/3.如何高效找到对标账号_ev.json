        "Content": "Finding accurate benchmark accounts on Xiaohongshu is essential for creating effective content strategies. The key principle is to avoid using the search function to find these accounts. Searching often brings up outdated posts that are no longer recommended by the system. For example, if you search for 'jeans,' you might find high-engagement posts from last year, but these accounts may no longer be active or recommended by the system. Instead, focus on accounts that the system currently recommends. These accounts are being actively promoted to other users, indicating that their content is currently popular and engaging. To find these accounts, scroll through your feed and look for posts with high engagement, such as likes and comments. Click on these posts and examine the account's recent activity and engagement metrics. This method ensures that you are benchmarking against accounts that are relevant and currently performing well, which can provide more accurate insights for your content strategy."

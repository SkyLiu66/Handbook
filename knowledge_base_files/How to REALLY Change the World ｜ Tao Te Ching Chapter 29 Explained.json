Instead of trying to change the world, prioritize self-improvement and addressing conflicts within your immediate environment. Reflect on the importance of listening to intuition to determine where your efforts are most needed. Remember that lasting change starts from within and spreads outward, rather than attempting to change distant or unknown situations."

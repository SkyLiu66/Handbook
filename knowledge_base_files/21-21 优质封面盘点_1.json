        "Content": "On Xiaohongshu, the cover image of a post plays a crucial role in attracting user attention. The cover occupies about three-quarters of the screen space, making it the first thing users notice. A well-designed cover can significantly increase the likelihood of users clicking on the post. Conversely, a poorly designed cover can deter users, regardless of the quality of the content within the post. Therefore, the cover is the first and most important hurdle in engaging users. It should be clean, organized, and visually appealing to create an immediate impulse for users to click. This is especially important for posts aimed at promoting products, as a compelling cover can drive higher conversion rates."

        "Content": "Effective topic selection is crucial for creating viral content. The most important element in content creation is the topic, followed by the cover, title, and content. Many creators fail to produce viral content because their topics do not resonate with a broad audience. Common mistakes include sharing personal life details or selfies, which lack user-centric value. Users seek content that provides value, such as makeup tips or emotional satisfaction. Therefore, your content must create value for the user to attract their attention. Another mistake is blindly emulating celebrities or major influencers, whose large follower base allows them to post anything and still gain traction. As an ordinary creator, you need to focus on topics that cover a wide audience. For example, topics like self-discipline, financial success, and relationships are universally appealing. By choosing broad topics, you increase the likelihood of your content becoming viral. Conversely, niche topics, while valuable, have a smaller audience and are less likely to go viral. Therefore, selecting topics that appeal to a wide audience is essential for achieving viral success."

            "engagement"
        ],
        "Content": "Creating user resonance involves tapping into shared emotions and experiences to engage your audience. Resonance is achieved when your content evokes similar feelings or experiences in your audience, leading to emotional engagement. For example, the term 'small-town test-taker' became a viral topic because it resonated with many people who felt marginalized. By addressing this shared experience, content creators were able to evoke strong emotional responses, leading to high engagement. To create resonance, focus on common experiences or emotions that your target audience can relate to. This could be anything from overcoming challenges to celebrating small victories. By providing emotional value, you encourage your audience to engage with your content, share it, and support it. This emotional connection is a powerful tool for building a loyal audience and increasing the likelihood of your content going viral. Therefore, understanding and leveraging user resonance is essential for effective content creation."

        ],
        "Content": "Timely hot topic tracking is essential for leveraging current trends to create viral content. Hot topics have a limited window of relevance, usually within the first three days of their emergence. To capitalize on these trends, you need to create and publish content quickly. For example, during the Winter Olympics, content related to athletes like Eileen Gu or trending fitness routines gained significant traction. However, if you post about a hot topic after the initial surge, the chances of your content going viral decrease significantly. Therefore, it's crucial to act quickly and prioritize completion over perfection. While blindly chasing trends is not advisable, strategically leveraging hot topics can provide a significant boost, especially for new creators. By staying updated on current trends and acting swiftly, you can increase the visibility and engagement of your content. Therefore, timely hot topic tracking is a valuable strategy for achieving viral success."

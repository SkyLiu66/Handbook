Welfare products are used to attract customers with high conversion rates, while profit products aim to increase the average order value. Marketing products help in creating a buzz and drawing attention to other products. For new accounts, it's advisable to start with fewer products to avoid overwhelming the audience. Focus on products with strong advantages and gradually introduce more items as the account gains traction."

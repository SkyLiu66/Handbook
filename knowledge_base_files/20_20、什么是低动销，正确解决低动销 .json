        "Content": "Low sales activity, or 'low moving sales,' occurs when a store has many products but few or no sales. This situation often arises during bulk listing processes. To address low sales activity, one effective method is to use secondary accounts to make purchases. This involves preparing one or two secondary accounts to buy products from your store through Xiaohongshu's marketplace or by searching for notes. Ensure that these purchases are genuine, with actual shipping and confirmed receipt. This process helps increase the sales activity rate, which is crucial for improving the store's ranking and product visibility. The sales activity rate is calculated based on the number of products sold within a month. For example, if a store has 100 products and 80 of them are sold within a month, the sales activity rate is 80%. A higher sales activity rate leads to higher product weight and better visibility in search results. Therefore, maintaining a high sales activity rate is essential for the overall performance of your store."

        "Content": "The sales activity rate is a critical metric for improving a store's ranking on Xiaohongshu. This rate is determined by the proportion of products sold within a specific period, typically a month. A higher sales activity rate indicates that a significant number of products are being sold, which positively impacts the store's ranking and visibility. To improve this rate, store owners can use secondary accounts to make initial purchases, ensuring that each product has at least one sale. This strategy helps boost the sales activity rate and, consequently, the store's ranking. Additionally, regularly monitoring and managing the product listings is essential. Products that have not sold within a month should be either deleted or re-listed as new items. This practice helps maintain a high sales activity rate and prevents the store from being flagged for low sales activity. By focusing on improving the sales activity rate, store owners can enhance their store's performance and attract more customers."

Store owners should regularly review their product listings and identify items that have not sold within a specific period, such as a month. These products should either be deleted or re-listed as new items to prevent the store from being flagged for low sales activity. Using secondary accounts to make initial purchases can also help maintain a high sales activity rate. This involves preparing a few secondary accounts to buy products from the store, ensuring that each product has at least one sale. Additionally, store owners should monitor the performance of their notes and adjust their strategies accordingly. Notes with low engagement and no sales should be revised or replaced with new content. By actively managing product listings and using strategic purchasing methods, store owners can maintain a high sales activity rate and improve their store's overall performance."

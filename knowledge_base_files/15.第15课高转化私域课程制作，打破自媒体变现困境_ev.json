        "Content": "To create high-conversion private domain courses, it is essential to have a clear monetization strategy. Without a product, an account cannot form a monetization loop and thus lacks value. Not all products are suitable for private domain courses; they must be high-ticket and have high repurchase rates. Examples include weight loss courses, self-media courses, and emotional intelligence courses. Low-ticket, low-repurchase products like scissors or vases are not suitable. A good product should have high customer retention, high conversion rates, and high referral rates. The product should also have a high gross profit margin. For instance, self-media courses that teach traffic generation, monetization, and private coaching are ideal because they are high-ticket and have high conversion and referral rates."

        "Content": "Excellent courses possess four key characteristics: practicality, necessity, differentiation, and timeliness. Practicality means the course should be based on the instructor's expertise and proven methods. Necessity implies that the course addresses the immediate needs of the users. Differentiation involves finding unique selling points that set the course apart from similar offerings in the market. Timeliness emphasizes the importance of quickly bringing the course to market to capitalize on current trends and user needs. For example, a self-media course should not only cover common topics like content creation and traffic generation but also include unique aspects like private domain monetization and performance improvement. This approach ensures that the course stands out and meets the specific needs of its target audience."

Third, establish a course framework by analyzing competitors and identifying your unique selling points. Design a detailed course outline with engaging and impactful titles. Fourth, incorporate teaching experiences to ensure the content is digestible and engaging. Use a mix of theoretical and practical content, and include interactive elements like exercises and group discussions. Finally, fill in the course content with your unique insights and experiences. Avoid copying others' content directly; instead, internalize and adapt it to fit your style and narrative. This approach ensures that your course is coherent, engaging, and valuable to your audience."

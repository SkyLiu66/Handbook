        "Content": "One of the key strategies for selecting products is to find those that have gone viral despite having low follower counts. This approach is particularly useful on platforms like Douyin (TikTok). Start by using a specialized software tool to search for products that have recently become popular. Focus on items that have high sales but are promoted by users with fewer followers. This indicates that the product itself has strong appeal and can sell well without the need for a large audience. Look for products that are primarily sold through short videos rather than live streams, as this method is more accessible for new sellers. By identifying low-follower viral products, you can find items that have a high potential for success with minimal initial investment."

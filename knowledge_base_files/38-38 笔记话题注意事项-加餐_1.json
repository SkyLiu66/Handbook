        "Content": "When creating content, it is crucial to use popular topics that already have a high level of interest and engagement. Platforms like Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book) are interest-based, meaning the popularity of a topic can significantly influence the reach and engagement of your post. For example, a topic like 'Tesla' will naturally attract more interest than a niche topic like 'How to Make Beautiful Eyelashes.' The number of people interested in a topic directly affects the potential reach of your post. Therefore, instead of creating new topics, leverage existing popular topics to maximize your content's visibility. To find popular topics, you can use the platform's built-in tools like the 'Note Inspiration' section in the creation center. This section provides trending topics based on your account's tags. By consistently using high-engagement topics, you can significantly increase the chances of your content going viral."

        "Content": "Creating new topics for your content can be tempting, but it often leads to lower engagement and visibility. New or self-created topics typically have little to no existing interest, which means fewer people will see your content. For instance, if you create a topic like 'My Favorite Cup,' it is unlikely to attract significant attention compared to established topics with millions of views. Instead, focus on using existing popular topics that already have a large audience. This approach ensures that your content is seen by more people, increasing the likelihood of engagement and shares. To identify suitable topics, explore the platform's trending sections and use high-engagement tags related to your content. By aligning your posts with popular topics, you can enhance your content's performance and reach a broader audience."

        "Content": "Leveraging platform tools for topic selection is essential for optimizing your content's reach and engagement. Most social media platforms, including Xiaohongshu, offer tools that help creators identify trending topics and popular tags. For example, the 'Note Inspiration' section in Xiaohongshu's creation center provides a list of trending topics tailored to your account's tags. By regularly checking this section, you can stay updated on what topics are currently popular and relevant to your niche. Additionally, you can experiment with different topics to see which ones generate the most engagement for your content. Use the platform's sorting features to identify high-engagement tags and include them in your posts. This strategic use of platform tools ensures that your content is aligned with current trends, maximizing its potential reach and impact."

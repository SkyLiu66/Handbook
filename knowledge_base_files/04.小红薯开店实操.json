        "Content": "Opening a personal store involves several steps that are straightforward but crucial for setting up your business correctly. First, create a new account and navigate to 'My' section. In the top left corner, click on the three horizontal lines to access the menu. From there, select 'Creator Center' and then 'More Services.' Click on 'Open Store' to begin the process. You will see options for different types of stores: personal, individual business, and enterprise. For most individuals, a personal store is sufficient and allows you to sell over 90% of common items. However, for specific categories like food items (e.g., apples, snacks), you may need an enterprise account with a business license and a food safety certificate. After selecting 'Personal Store,' proceed to the next step by uploading your identification documents. Once uploaded, you will be required to pay a security deposit of 1000 units. This deposit is refundable and allows you to participate in various promotional activities and advanced operational features. It is advisable to pay this deposit if you have the means, as it can significantly enhance your store's functionality and credibility. Ensure you have selected your products before opening the store to streamline the process and avoid unnecessary fees."

        "Content": "Understanding the different types of stores and their requirements is essential for choosing the right one for your business. There are primarily three types of stores: personal, individual business, and enterprise. A personal store is suitable for most individuals and allows you to sell a wide range of products. However, certain categories like food items and 3C digital products require an enterprise store. An enterprise store necessitates a business license and, in some cases, additional certifications like a food safety certificate. For example, selling apples can be done through a personal store, but selling other food items may require an enterprise account. The enterprise store also offers more advanced features and greater credibility, which can be beneficial for larger businesses. When setting up your store, you will need to upload identification documents and pay a security deposit. This deposit is typically around 1000 units and is refundable. It allows you to access various promotional activities and advanced operational features, making it a worthwhile investment if you have the means. By understanding these requirements, you can choose the store type that best fits your business needs and ensures compliance with regulations."

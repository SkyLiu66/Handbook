        "Content": "Video editing can be intimidating for beginners, but understanding the basic tools and functions of editing software like Jianying can make the process smoother. Jianying is available in both professional and mobile versions, making it versatile for different editing needs. The software includes essential features such as frame extraction, aspect ratio settings, and a timeline for smooth transitions. Frames are static images that the system uses to compare and remove duplicates. Aspect ratios like 9:16 and 16:9 are crucial for different video formats, especially for platforms like TikTok. The timeline helps in managing transitions between scenes, ensuring they are smooth or adding effects like explosions or starry skies. Understanding these basic functions is the first step in mastering video editing."

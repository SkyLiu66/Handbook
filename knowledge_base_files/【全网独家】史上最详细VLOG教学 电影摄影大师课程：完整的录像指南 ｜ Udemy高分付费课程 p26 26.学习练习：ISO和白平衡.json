So let's see what we can find. Alright so we have our first image here on my smartphone and we can see our shutter speed is at 24 frames per second. Our white balance is at tungsten so there's kind of this weird purplish hue to it and so our auto white balance is set to the improper setting for this type of environment and our ISO is pretty high for this kind of scenario. So what I'm going to do first is start with the shutter speed and I'm going to go to 50th and then I'm going to move to our white balance here and I'm going to go to manual. Okay. And now I'm going to go and I'm going to set this, see that's a little too blue, the Kelvin rating is too low. I'm going to go at about 3500 here. I'm going to tap on where we want to focus and I'm going to check the ISO here. Bring the ISO down just a little bit. Perfect. And so here's my before and here's my after shot.",

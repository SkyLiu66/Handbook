        "Content": "When selecting products to sell on Xiaohongshu, it's crucial to consider the preferences of the platform's primary user base, which is predominantly female. Popular categories include clothing, shoes, bags, beauty products, and accessories. However, new sellers should be cautious with clothing, shoes, and bags due to high return rates, which can be as high as 40-50%. Beauty products, especially branded items like eyeshadows and eyebrow pencils, offer good opportunities but require a reliable supply chain. Accessories, particularly those priced under 50 yuan, can be a good entry point due to lower competition and higher chances of becoming popular. Always research and benchmark against competitors to set appropriate prices and manage expectations."

Keep prices low initially to attract customers and ensure the products are visually appealing and tasty to encourage repeat business. Building a reliable supply chain is crucial to maintain quality and customer satisfaction."

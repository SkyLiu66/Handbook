        "Content": "Creating a personal IP (Intellectual Property) is crucial for sustained success in self-media. While it's possible to make quick money by simply producing content, such as reposting videos, this approach often leads to one-time earnings. In contrast, a personal IP allows for continuous income streams. Personal IP involves building a recognizable persona that combines identity, influence, and expertise. For example, Li Jiaqi, known for his expertise in beauty products, has millions of followers and generates significant revenue through his live-streaming skills. Personal IPs create a lasting impression, making it easier for audiences to trust and follow them, leading to diverse monetization opportunities like advertising, training, and product sales."

Your surroundings should reinforce this identity, such as a professional setting for educational content. Next, develop a robust knowledge system in your field of expertise.

For example, historical figures like Confucius and modern entrepreneurs like Lei Jun have built influential personal IPs based on their comprehensive knowledge systems. Finally, integrate your personal values and attitudes into your content to create a relatable and trustworthy persona. By focusing on these aspects, you can create a personal IP that stands out and attracts a loyal following."

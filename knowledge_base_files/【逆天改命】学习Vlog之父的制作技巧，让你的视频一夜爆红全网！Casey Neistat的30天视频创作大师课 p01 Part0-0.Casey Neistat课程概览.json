It can come from personal experiences, observations, or spontaneous thoughts. Embrace spontaneity and be open to where the idea takes you. This initial spark is crucial as it shapes the direction and tone of your film. By focusing on a strong idea, you can create a solid foundation for your movie, making it more engaging and dynamic. The idea is what kicks you off the edge of the cliff and gets you moving, setting the stage for everything that follows."

            "Content": "Making your story more dynamic involves embracing spontaneity and allowing for unexpected moments during the filmmaking process. In this style of filmmaking, the story often presents itself during the shooting process. Instead of rigidly sticking to a script, be open to unexpected moments and let them shape your narrative. This approach can lead to more genuine and surprising elements in your film. The actual writing and structuring of the story often take place during the editing phase, where you can piece together the spontaneous moments into a cohesive three-act structure. By allowing for improvisation and spontaneity, you can create a more lively and engaging film that resonates with your audience."

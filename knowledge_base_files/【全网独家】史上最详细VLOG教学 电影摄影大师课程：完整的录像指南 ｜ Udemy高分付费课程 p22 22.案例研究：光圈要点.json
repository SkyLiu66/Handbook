It's a very important fundamental understanding of how to get the most out of your camera and video settings. So aperture simply put is the f-stop number. The lower the f-stop number, right now I'm shooting at 2.8, the wider the lens opening and the more amount of light is getting into the camera. The higher the number, the exact opposite. The less light, the less depth of field. So let's explain what that means. So the higher the f-stop, the smaller opening and the less depth of field. This is great when you want to make everything in focus, like for landscape shot, action shots where there's a lot of movement or a lot of things in the image you want to have in focus and really wide angle shots. The lower the f-stop, the lower the aperture. This has more depth of field. This is great for when you want what is in focus to be sharp and what is closer and further to be out of focus. This has a more cinematic look and feel. This is great for controlled situations, shots when you're, you know, talking to the camera or you're shooting someone that's talking to the camera because it blurs out the background and makes the image look more professional. So let me ask you here. Which out of these two images? Which one has a low f-stop or aperture and a high f-stop or aperture? Image number one with this leaf and image number two with this open landscape. So would you guess that image number one with the leaf is a wide aperture with a shallow depth of field or a narrow depth of field with a high aperture? Okay, perfect. Yes, this is shot at f2. The aperture is wide open. So the leaf is in focus. Behind it is blurred. This gives a really great look and style. So we want to keep this in mind when we're going into our own projects. Do we want to have, you know, that everything is in focus look that's more action oriented? Are we shooting like some parkour video where someone's doing backflips off a bridge? Maybe, maybe not. So this image on the right, if you had to guess the f-stop, what would you guess? Would it be an f4, f5, f10, f15? It's got to be up there pretty high. So let's see. F22. That's why the rocks that are only a few feet away from the camera are just as in focus as that mountain that's hundreds of feet away from the camera. So hopefully that gives you an idea of when to use a wide aperture and when to use a higher low aperture. Right now I'm shooting at f2.0, which is a relatively low aperture because I know I want to be in focus. And I want the background. So. I'm not shooting blurry, right? I'm not shooting this really cool mountain landscape. So I'm not at f22. Plus I'm not out in a really bright scenario with broad daylight. You're going to need a really high aperture and that's going to give you a properly exposed image.",

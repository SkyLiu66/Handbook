        "Content": "Adjusting an image to a 3:4 ratio is essential for platforms like Xiaohongshu, which prefer this format. To achieve this, you can use image editing software like Meitu Xiuxiu. First, open the image in the software and select the 'Adjust' or 'Crop' option. Choose the 3:4 ratio from the available presets. This adjustment may result in some parts of the image being cropped out, so ensure that the essential elements remain visible. If the image does not look appealing after cropping, you can use the 'Background' feature to add a 3:4 background and then enlarge the main image to fit within this frame. This method ensures that the image maintains its visual appeal while conforming to the required ratio. Always preview the final image to ensure it meets your standards before saving and uploading it."

Therefore, the text should be concise, relevant, and visually appealing. When adding text, avoid using prohibited words to prevent your content from being flagged. Use clear and attractive fonts that complement the image. You can enhance the text's visibility by adding borders or shadows. Additionally, consider the placement of the text to ensure it does not obscure important parts of the image. Experiment with different styles and placements to find what works best for your content. Remember, the goal is to make the text eye-catching and informative, encouraging users to engage with your post."

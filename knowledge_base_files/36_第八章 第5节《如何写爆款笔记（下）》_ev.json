        "Content": "Rewriting content involves taking an existing piece and modifying it to make it more engaging and relevant. This can be done by summarizing the main points in your own words, adding personal experiences, and emphasizing low input and high output. For example, if a piece of content outlines three key points for growing followers on a platform, you can rewrite it by highlighting how following these steps can save time and effort. Additionally, you can enrich the content by adding unique elements that were not present in the original, such as personal anecdotes or additional tips. The goal is to make the content more relatable and valuable to the audience, thereby increasing engagement."

        "Content": "Using frameworks to create original content involves borrowing the structure of a successful piece and applying it to a different topic. This method allows you to maintain a proven format while introducing new ideas. For instance, if a framework effectively explains a topic in the field of social media, you can adapt it to discuss a different subject, such as career transitions. The key is to retain the original structure, including the introduction, main points, and conclusion, while changing the content to fit the new topic. This approach ensures that your content is well-organized and engaging, even if the subject matter is entirely different. By doing so, you can create fresh and original content that resonates with your audience."

This can include insights from social media, books, articles, and other credible sources. For example, if you are discussing the concept of self-motivation, you can reference studies or expert opinions from platforms like Zhihu, WeChat Reading, or Douyin. The key is to adapt these insights to fit your content framework, ensuring that they are relevant and add value. Additionally, it is important to rewrite the information in your own words to avoid plagiarism and to make the content more authentic. By continuously seeking new information and perspectives, you can keep your content fresh, informative, and engaging for your audience."

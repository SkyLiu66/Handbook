        "Content": "Building an IP (Intellectual Property) on Xiaohongshu is akin to creating a personal brand that conveys your unique value and perspective. Unlike general personal branding, an IP on Xiaohongshu should focus on delivering specific value to your audience. This involves choosing a niche or 'track' that aligns with your expertise and interests. Your IP should reflect a clear and correct value system, as the platform's user base tends to have a high level of awareness and discernment. While it's acceptable to have conflicting viewpoints to generate engagement, ensure that these conflicts are constructive and not offensive. For example, you can discuss how people of different body types can dress fashionably without making absolute negative statements. The goal is to create a brand that resonates with your audience and stands out in the crowded Xiaohongshu ecosystem."

        "Content": "When building your IP on Xiaohongshu, it's crucial to avoid certain common mistakes. Firstly, don't overly focus on sharing personal life content unless you are a major influencer. Xiaohongshu users primarily follow accounts for practical benefits like product recommendations and reviews, not for personal updates. Secondly, understand that an IP cannot be artificially created; it evolves naturally as you consistently produce valuable content. Your goal should not be to 'create an IP' but to provide continuous value, which will organically lead to the formation of your IP. Lastly, ensure that your IP has the capacity for sustained growth. While it's fine to draw inspiration from others initially, you must innovate continually to keep your audience engaged. Remember, loyalty is not guaranteed; you need to keep offering new and desirable content to maintain and grow your follower base."

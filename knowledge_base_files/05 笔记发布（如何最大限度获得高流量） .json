        "Content": "To maximize the reach of your notes on Xiaohongshu, it's important to publish them correctly. Instead of using the '+' button on the main page, go to the 'Creation Center' and select 'Inspiration Notes.' New accounts that subscribe will receive a traffic subsidy. Regular participation also earns traffic subsidies. After creating your note, check if it can be promoted using 'Shutiao.' If it can, the note is compliant; if not, it may be violating guidelines and will have limited reach. Additionally, you can check if your note is indexed by searching your Xiaohongshu ID. Publishing at optimal times, such as 10 PM, and spacing out posts by half an hour across multiple accounts can also enhance visibility. Diversifying your content across platforms like Douyin, Kuaishou, and WeChat can further expand your reach."

        "Content": "Understanding and handling note violations on Xiaohongshu is crucial for maintaining visibility. Notes can be flagged for violations even without explicit keywords if they contain marketing content. To check for violations, attempt to promote the note using 'Shutiao.' If promotion is blocked, the note is likely in violation and will have restricted reach. Another method is to search for your Xiaohongshu ID to see if the note is indexed. If not, it may be flagged. To avoid violations, consider certifying your account, which costs around 600 RMB and allows for up to three accounts. Additionally, mixing in motivational or entrepreneurial content can reduce the risk of being flagged. If a note performs well, you can further optimize it by changing the title or cover and reposting it to gain additional traction."

        "Content": "Expanding your content strategy beyond Xiaohongshu can significantly increase your reach. Platforms like Douyin, Kuaishou, and WeChat also support text and video content, allowing you to create a content matrix. This approach not only diversifies your audience but also mitigates the risk of relying on a single platform. Using software tools to publish content across multiple platforms simultaneously can streamline this process. Additionally, consider the timing of your posts; publishing at night, particularly around 10 PM, and spacing out posts by half an hour can optimize engagement. By leveraging multiple platforms and optimizing your publishing strategy, you can create a robust and effective content distribution network."

In some scenarios that's okay, you'll be totally fine. In a lot of scenarios, you'll want to be using an app of some kind that will let you adjust these parameters as if it was a DSLR or mirrorless camera. My favorite app to use, I have an iPhone, it's called Pro Movie, it's completely free. This app is amazing. It allows for you to shoot at higher resolutions, higher bit rates, which is just basically the amount of information that the camera is recording, which the higher the bit rate, the better the quality overall. So I highly recommend shooting something with Pro Movie. I don't know about Android. I don't know about the other kind of apps, but I'm sure that you guys are familiar with some of them. You can just go onto the app store and choose or search a pro recording app for your phone. If you have any favorites and you want to share it in the Q&A section with some of your students, that would be much appreciated. Go ahead and hop into the Q&A section and if you already have a video recording app that you use for your phone, please share it. And finally, I'm going to be demonstrating the Sony Xperia X. I'm going to be doing a screen capture on my phone, which is linked to my camera. So it's going to be the same type of settings that you're going to have on your camera or phone. It's just probably going to look a little bit different, but regardless if it's a DSLR mirrorless or phone, you'll have to look for the settings in wherever matches for the device that you're using. But that is it for our overview. In the next lecture, we're going to drop into ISO, shutter speed and exposure. I'll see you guys in the next lecture.",

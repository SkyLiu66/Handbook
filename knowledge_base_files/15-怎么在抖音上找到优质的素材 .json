        "Content": "To find suitable content on Douyin, focus on videos that have gone viral within the last 24 hours. This ensures that the content is fresh and less likely to have been reused by others. If you can't find suitable content within 24 hours, extend your search to videos from the past week. Avoid using content from large accounts as they often post on multiple platforms simultaneously, increasing the risk of duplication. Instead, look for videos from smaller accounts that have suddenly gained high engagement. This strategy helps you identify high-potential content that can be repurposed effectively on other platforms like Xiaohongshu."

This increases the risk of your content being flagged as duplicate. Additionally, avoid videos where the creator's face is prominently featured, as these are more likely to be reported for copyright infringement. Instead, focus on videos that have suddenly gained high engagement but are from smaller accounts. These videos are less likely to have been widely shared, reducing the risk of duplication. By carefully selecting your content sources, you can maintain originality and comply with platform guidelines."

        "Content": "Once you have identified suitable content, use tools to edit and repurpose it. Start by copying the video link and using a free tool like Qingdou to remove watermarks and extract text. These tools often require you to watch a short advertisement before you can use their features. After removing the watermark, edit the video to make it unique. This may involve trimming, adding new elements, or combining it with other content. By doing so, you can create a new, original piece of content that complies with platform guidelines and stands out to your audience. This process helps you maximize the potential of sourced content while maintaining originality."

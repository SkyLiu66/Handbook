        "Content": "The growth of commercial accounts on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu can be divided into three main stages: the initial accumulation phase, the rapid growth phase, and the stabilization phase. During the initial accumulation phase, the focus is on activating the account and gaining initial followers. This involves activities like posting notes, engaging with other users, and gradually building up the account's activity level. The goal is to reach a certain number of followers to unlock more features, such as the ability to receive orders. The rapid growth phase follows, where the account experiences a significant increase in followers and engagement. This is often achieved by posting high-quality content that resonates with the audience. During this phase, it's crucial to maintain a balance between promotional content and regular posts to avoid overwhelming the audience. Finally, the stabilization phase is where the account reaches a steady state of growth and engagement. At this stage, the focus shifts to maintaining the quality of content, managing orders efficiently, and exploring new ways to engage with the audience. It's important to continue monitoring performance metrics and adjusting strategies as needed to ensure sustained growth."

Regularly posting new content helps keep the audience engaged and attracts new followers. For new accounts, it's recommended to post multiple times a day to quickly build up content and activity. As the account grows, maintaining a daily posting schedule ensures that the audience remains engaged and the account stays relevant. The content should be a mix of promotional posts and valuable information that resonates with the target audience. This balance helps in building trust and credibility, which are crucial for long-term success. Additionally, consistent updates signal to the platform's algorithm that the account is active, which can lead to better visibility and reach. It's also important to monitor the performance of each post and adjust the content strategy based on what works best. By staying consistent and responsive to audience feedback, commercial accounts can build a loyal following and achieve sustained growth."

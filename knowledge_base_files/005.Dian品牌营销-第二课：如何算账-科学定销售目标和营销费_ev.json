            "Content": "Understanding the differences between various marketing tools like 'Shoutao Search' and 'Pinxiaobao' is crucial. 'Shoutao Search' includes some free traffic from within Taobao, while 'Pinxiaobao' relies almost entirely on traffic from Xiaohongshu. For accurate sales and conversion metrics, 'Pinxiaobao' is more reliable. When setting sales targets, consider factors like average order value and conversion rates. For instance, if your sales target is 1 million RMB with an average order value of 150 RMB, and a conversion rate of 10%, you need to calculate the required number of visitors and marketing costs. High conversion rates indicate strong content and effective product landing pages. Analyze past performance to identify areas for improvement, such as content quality, product presentation, and user reviews."

            "Keywords": ["marketing costs", "conversion rates", "calculation"],
            "Content": "To calculate marketing costs and conversion rates, start with your sales target and average order value. For example, if your sales target is 1 million RMB and the average order value is 150 RMB, you need approximately 6,667 orders. If your conversion rate is 10%, you need 66,670 visitors. The cost per visitor can be estimated based on past marketing spend and visitor numbers. For instance, if you spent 100,000 RMB to attract 10,000 visitors, your cost per visitor is 10 RMB. Use these metrics to plan your marketing budget and optimize your campaigns. Ensure that your content on Xiaohongshu is engaging and aligns with your product offerings to maximize conversion rates."

Negative reviews can significantly impact conversion rates, so address any issues promptly. For example, if you are promoting a whitening product on Xiaohongshu, ensure that the corresponding Tmall landing page features the same product prominently. Consistency between your marketing content and product landing pages can enhance user trust and improve conversion rates. Additionally, analyze the performance of different content types and adjust your strategies accordingly to maximize effectiveness."

    "data": " Okay, perfect. So what we have here is our shot list. So if you haven't already, please download the shot list in the downloadable resources tab in the lecture of this course. And so I have my blank shot list here. And I also have my overall kind of script that I just kind of typed out some bullet points of what I'm saying. This will be the easiest way for us to follow along and create the shot list. So first, I start off with this, I have a confession to make, it's tough to say I'm addicted to coffee. This is going to be definitely a shot of me. Okay, so what I'm going to do here is me sitting at desk. Okay, and the shot type is going to be a medium shot. Yes, because we remember the different shot types. And because it's a waist up shot, this is a medium shot. Okay, character is going to be Julian. Okay. And the location is going to be living room. Now for the cells where we have the actual imagery, this can be hand drawn, or you can pull these shots from the internet. I'm not going to do any hand drawn stuff for timing in this course, but you're more than welcome to have this printed out and draw just an overall general aesthetic of what you envision that shot looking like. So for this example, what I'm going to do is pull a screenshot. From the framing that I know I'm going to have. Okay, perfect. Since we know this is going to be our framing. I'm going to take a screenshot and you're more than welcome to download the shot from online, go through Pinterest, go through Instagram, whatever it is, screenshot it to get the right style that makes sense for the video that you're shooting. Boom. Okay. There we go. So yeah, you know, this realization hit me earlier today. And so we have our first overall shot done. Okay. Now I'm going to move on to the next main part of the video where I know I'm going to have another important shot. So I say, I just love the whole experience of it from start to finish the beans, the texture of those sweet beans. So what I'm going to do here is definitely grab some. A shot online that I like. That's a closeup on the coffee beans. So this is definitely the vibe I'm going for. So what I'm going to do here is save it to our screenshot. Shot number two. Okay, perfect. And of course, you know, you can really fill this out as much as you want and get as in detail as you need to, depending on, you know, if it's. A more straightforward online video, that's kind of you doing something that's a funny montage and it's kind of more candid and more casual. You can maybe have three main shots that are very important that you know, that need to make it into the video. That could be your opening shot, your middle shot and your ending shot. You know, if it's more of a serious tone characters and dialogue, or you're, you got hired to do a project for a doctor's office. Yeah. You know, you're going to be doing a lot of the work that you're going to be doing. And you're going to want to see what you're going to be doing. And you're going to want to know ahead of time, the overview of what you're going to be doing. So please use this as in-depth as you'd like for this purpose, for time's sake, I'm going to be a little bit more brief here, but I want you guys to be able to get the idea of the workflow and how this process works. So for the next shot, the scene is going to be in my kitchen and this is going to be close. Up shots. Of. Beans and coffee making process. So I could list out those specific processes, process processes. I don't know about the word, but I could list out those specific ones of being, you know, heating up the water, getting out the beans, getting out the French press, the coffee maker, hitting the button. I'm going to keep it broad here, but have enough information so that while I'm glancing at it, while I shoot, I know exactly what I need to shoot. Okay. Okay. I'm going to go ahead and get the shot. And this is B roll. Okay. And I'm going to put close ups. Cause I know a lot of these shots are going to be really tight, close shots. You can see the detail of the beans and the coffee and the steam and all those cool things that I want to be accentuating with what I'm saying. So the next main point here is brewing it, taking all the finely ground coffee beans, marrying the piping out water. So what I want for that is going to be something. That is maybe yes. Okay. Perfect. Yeah. I want to see that shot. That's showing the ground coffee going into the coffee machine or the French press, depending on what I end up shooting with. Okay. We're going to call this shot three. This is a very important shot. Okay. And I really do also like one thing about this one is directly overhead. That's going to be a perfect kind of unique view for this kind of scene where it's like a creating process of a quick montage of different steps of a final process. It's cool to have the top down angle. So this is perfect. So placing coffee grounds, coffee grounds into machine or hot or hot water. And I'm just going to kind of skip forward here a little bit to pouring. Okay. So pouring coffee. Let's see. Yeah, I want to do something like this. I like the vibe. We see the condensation, good lighting. This is just a really cool kind of style. So I'm going to save this as a reference. Boom. And what I'm going to do now is kind of skip to the final shot because we have the part in the video where it cuts back. So it cuts back to me. I deliver the punch line and then it's the end of the video. So I already know what that's going to look like. So let me. And just as a brief description, I'm going to say final punch line. Me cut to me holding coffee cup. A roll. A roll. Character. Yeah. On second thought. And so there you go. This is really an overview of how to properly use a shot list. And of course it's important to be flexible with this. You know, feature films go all the way over to the very structured side where these are used like a science and like complete with complete perfection. And so it's really a guideline or a framework for you to use that the professionals use to a tee. But for us video creators that are creating for more online content, of course you can ignore using something like this and your videos may be okay. Of course you can implement using something like this to the degree that makes sense for you. And it's going to make your videos just a little bit better because not many people are taking the time to really plan out what's going on, what's happening. And this little extra step really can go a long way with making your videos more impactful, more enjoyable to watch, more straightforward and to the point. So go ahead, fill out your shot list or finish filling out your shot list because in the next lecture I'm going to be doing a crash course with you guys on filming your epic B roll. And you're going to have an idea of what you want to be filming. You're going to be working alongside me as I'm shooting these shots that I just laid out in this learning exercise with you guys going to be actually filming them using shot types, using camera movement and all that good stuff. So with that said, let's get into the next lecture.",

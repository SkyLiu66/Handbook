        "Content": "When starting on Xiaohongshu, it is crucial to select an initial batch of 30 to 50 products. This range ensures you have enough variety to attract different customer segments without overwhelming yourself. Use computer software to bulk upload these products and gather materials for each one. Write notes and attach links to guide users to your store. This initial selection sets the foundation for your store's visibility and engagement. Regularly update your product list based on seasonal trends and popular items. For instance, as the weather changes, update your inventory with relevant clothing items like short sleeves or skirts. This approach keeps your store aligned with current trends and maintains a steady flow of traffic and sales."

        "Content": "Maintaining product relevance is essential for continuous engagement and sales. After the initial selection, update your product list every week with 5 to 10 new trending items. This keeps your inventory fresh and aligned with current market demands. For categories with rapid turnover, like fashion, ensure your products reflect the latest trends and seasonal changes. For example, as summer approaches, stock up on summer clothing items. Regular updates prevent your store from becoming stagnant and ensure you capture ongoing trends. This strategy helps maintain a steady flow of traffic and keeps your audience engaged with new and relevant products."

        "Content": "When a product in your store goes viral, capitalize on its popularity to maximize sales. First, purchase samples of the viral product to create additional content. Use these samples to produce new images and videos, mixing them with existing materials to keep the content fresh. Continue to write notes and create posts about the viral product until its popularity wanes. Additionally, introduce similar products or variations to sustain interest. For example, if a specific type of skirt becomes popular, introduce different colors or styles of the same skirt. This approach leverages the existing interest and drives more traffic to your store. By continuously updating content and introducing related products, you can maintain the momentum and maximize the viral product's potential."

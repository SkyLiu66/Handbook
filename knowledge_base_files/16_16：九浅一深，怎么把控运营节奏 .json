        "Content": "In the early stages of account growth, it is crucial to focus on posting high-engagement content, such as guides, tips, and informative articles. These types of content may not directly bring in customers or conversions, but they help improve the account's rating and reduce the platform's scrutiny. For the first week, aim to post two pieces of high-engagement content daily without any promotional content. This establishes your account as trustworthy. As your account grows, expand your content to broader topics to attract a wider audience. For example, if you start with dessert-making tutorials, you can later include broader topics like culinary entrepreneurship. This helps to overcome the plateau in follower growth. When you notice a stagnation in engagement, it’s time to broaden your content scope. However, be cautious not to overextend to an audience that is too broad, as it may dilute your conversion rates."

        "Content": "A successful content strategy requires a balance between traffic-generating content and conversion-focused content. Traffic content, such as informative articles and guides, helps attract a broad audience and maintain high engagement levels. Conversion content, on the other hand, is designed to drive sales or sign-ups. It’s important to alternate between these two types of content to maintain a healthy account performance. For instance, after a period of posting conversion content, switch back to traffic content to boost your engagement metrics. This approach prevents a decline in your account’s visibility and ensures a steady flow of new followers. The key is to use traffic content to 'plant seeds' and conversion content to 'harvest' them. By maintaining this balance, you can effectively grow your audience while also achieving your business goals."

        "Content": "On Xiaohongshu, you can reuse high-engagement titles and content to maximize their effectiveness. The platform does not penalize for repeating titles, so you can use successful titles across multiple posts and accounts. Similarly, high-engagement cover images and content can be reused, but with some variations to avoid being flagged as duplicate content. For example, you can use the same title and cover image but change the subsequent images or slightly modify the content. This strategy allows you to efficiently produce content without constantly creating new material from scratch. Additionally, using different accounts to post similar content with slight variations can help you reach a broader audience without being penalized. This method simplifies content production and ensures that your high-engagement content continues to attract traffic."

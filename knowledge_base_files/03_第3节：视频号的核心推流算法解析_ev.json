            "Content": "The cold start phase is a critical period for new accounts on any platform, including Xiaohongshu. During this phase, the platform does not yet understand your target audience, resulting in a mix of low-quality traffic. This phase is akin to a probation period in a job, where the platform tests your ability to handle traffic. Many businesses fail to get past this phase because they do not understand the platform's push and popularity mechanisms. To create good content during this phase, focus on understanding the platform's algorithms and mechanisms. Ensure your content is engaging and relevant to your target audience. Use high-quality visuals and detailed descriptions to attract and retain viewers. Engage with your audience through comments and interactions to build a loyal following. By understanding and adapting to the platform's mechanisms, you can successfully navigate the cold start phase and build a strong foundation for your account."

        "Content": "On Xiaohongshu, it's important to balance the pursuit of popular posts (high likes and views) with the ultimate goal of conversion (turning viewers into customers). While popular posts can increase visibility, they do not always lead to conversions. The primary objective should be to create content that drives users to your private domain and eventually converts them into paying customers. For example, a post about a private hot spring might have fewer views than a post about a ski resort, but if the former leads to more conversions, it is more valuable. Therefore, focus on creating content that not only attracts attention but also encourages users to take action, such as contacting you or making a purchase. In summary, while popularity is beneficial, the main goal should be to create content that effectively converts viewers into customers."

        "Content": "The timeliness of your content is crucial on Xiaohongshu. The platform's policies and user needs are constantly evolving, so it's important to focus on recent trends and popular posts within your niche. Studying outdated content may not provide relevant insights due to changes in user preferences and platform algorithms.

Therefore, always analyze and draw inspiration from recent successful posts to ensure your content remains relevant and engaging. This approach helps you stay competitive and meet the current demands of your audience. In summary, keeping your content timely and relevant is essential for maintaining engagement and meeting user needs on Xiaohongshu."

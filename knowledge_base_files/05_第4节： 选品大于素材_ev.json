            "Content": "Hello everyone, good afternoon. In this session, we will discuss how to select hot-selling products on Xiaohongshu. We all know that hot-selling products come with their own traffic, and good products can attract more traffic to our store. When starting a new store, it is crucial to select hot-selling products to accelerate sales. These products already have a lot of attention and purchases, which can quickly expose our posts and increase click-through rates. Therefore, selecting good products can significantly improve our conversion rates. On Xiaohongshu, the majority of users are women, accounting for 90% of the user base, and 60% of them shop on the platform. Hence, it is essential to choose products with high repurchase rates among women. For example, clothing and accessories are popular choices, but they come with a high return rate. Other profitable categories include jewelry and emergency items like sun hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen, especially during the summer when outdoor activities are popular. By focusing on these categories, you can effectively increase your sales and conversions."

            "Content": "The second key idea is to target female consumers on Xiaohongshu. Since women make up 90% of the platform's user base, it is essential to select products that cater to their needs and preferences. Products with high repurchase rates, such as clothing, accessories, and beauty items, are ideal choices. For instance, clothing is a popular category, but it also has a high return rate. Jewelry, on the other hand, offers a high-profit margin. Emergency items like sun hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen are also in high demand, especially during the summer. By focusing on these categories, you can effectively attract female consumers and increase your sales. Additionally, it is important to avoid selecting products that have high competition, such as phone cases, especially if you are a new seller. Instead, choose categories with less competition to increase your chances of success."

            "Content": "The third key idea is to focus on specific categories for better results. On Xiaohongshu, it is important to choose a niche and stick to it. For example, if you decide to sell clothing, focus solely on clothing and avoid mixing in other categories like shoes or accessories. This helps in building a clear brand identity and attracting a specific audience. Additionally, focusing on a single category allows you to deeply understand the market and consumer preferences, leading to better product selection and higher sales. Some less competitive but profitable categories include outdoor sports equipment, fitness gear, and children's clothing. These categories have a high demand but fewer sellers, making them ideal choices for new sellers. By focusing on a specific category and deeply understanding your target audience, you can effectively increase your sales and build a successful store on Xiaohongshu."

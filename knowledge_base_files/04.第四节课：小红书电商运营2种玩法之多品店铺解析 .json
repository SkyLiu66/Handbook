        "Content": "The multi-product strategy on Xiaohongshu involves listing multiple products in a single store. This approach is commonly used by traditional e-commerce players who have transitioned from platforms like Taobao, Pinduoduo, and Douyin. The key advantage of this strategy is the potential for high customer order value, as it allows for a diverse range of products to be offered. However, it also comes with several challenges. Firstly, it requires constant product selection, especially during seasonal changes. Secondly, each product needs unique materials, which can be time-consuming to source. Additionally, having multiple products from different suppliers can lead to logistical issues, such as being flagged for having multiple shipping origins. This can complicate inventory management and customer service, especially when handling returns. Despite these challenges, the multi-product strategy can be highly profitable if managed well, particularly for those with strong supply chain capabilities or in-house production."

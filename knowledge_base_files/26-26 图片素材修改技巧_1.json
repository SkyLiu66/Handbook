        "Content": "When modifying downloaded images for non-cover pages on Xiaohongshu, it's important to ensure the images meet specific requirements. First, select images with a 3:4 aspect ratio. If the image isn't in this ratio, you can adjust it using photo editing software like Meitu Xiuxiu. After downloading the image, open it in Meitu Xiuxiu and crop it to a 3:4 ratio. Next, apply filters to enhance the image quality, but avoid overdoing it to maintain a natural look. Additionally, use the 'sharpen' feature to improve the image's clarity. If the image has a watermark, remove it using watermark removal software or crop it out. Finally, you can add text and stickers to the image, but keep them minimal to avoid a cluttered appearance. This process ensures that the images used in your Xiaohongshu notes are visually appealing and meet the platform's standards."

You can also add text and stickers to the image for additional customization. Meitu Xiuxiu offers a variety of fonts and stickers, but it's best to use them sparingly to maintain a clean and professional look.

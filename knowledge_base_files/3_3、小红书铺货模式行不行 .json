        "Content": "The product listing strategy on Xiaohongshu has undergone significant changes. Before June 2023, the platform allowed for a high volume of new product listings, providing ample traffic and opportunities to test and identify potential bestsellers. However, this approach is no longer viable. The platform now discourages mass product listings due to the risk of being flagged for non-compliance, particularly for practices like dropshipping from platforms like Pinduoduo. To avoid penalties, it is crucial to limit the number of new listings to two or three per day and ensure that all product images, titles, and descriptions are free from other store logos or watermarks. This shift necessitates a more selective and quality-focused approach to product listing."

        "Content": "Mass product listing on Xiaohongshu poses several risks, primarily related to platform compliance. When a large number of products are listed simultaneously, it increases the likelihood of being flagged for non-compliance, particularly for practices like dropshipping from other platforms. The platform has stringent rules against non-original content, and any product images or descriptions containing logos or watermarks from other stores can lead to penalties, including store suspension. Therefore, it is essential to carefully check all product details before listing. By adhering to a controlled listing strategy, with a limited number of new products each day, sellers can minimize the risk of non-compliance and maintain a stable presence on the platform."

        "Content": "To open a personal store on Xiaohongshu, you can use either a mobile device or a computer. First, download the Xiaohongshu app or use the Xiaohongshu Qianfan platform. You will need an ID card and a bank card, both registered under the same name. This is crucial to avoid any future financial disputes. Start by searching for 'open store' in the Xiaohongshu search bar. Click on the official Xiaohongshu e-commerce platform and select 'Open Store'. Choose the type of store you want to open, such as a personal store, which only requires an ID card. If you wish to open a sole proprietorship, you will need a business license and the operator's ID card. Follow the prompts to fill in the necessary information, such as ID card photos and business details. Once completed, your store can be opened, usually within the same day if all information is correct. Remember, the store name can be changed later, but only once every seven days."

        "Content": "When opening a store on Xiaohongshu, there are several important considerations to keep in mind. First, ensure that the ID card and bank card used for registration belong to the same person. This is essential for smooth financial transactions. Second, the store name can be changed later, but only once every seven days, so choose a temporary name if needed. Third, the platform charges a service fee of 5% on monthly sales exceeding 10,000 RMB. If your monthly sales are below this threshold, the service fee is waived. Additionally, different categories may require specific certifications, such as a food business license for selling food items or a 3C certification for electronics. It's advisable to avoid entering highly regulated categories unless you have the necessary expertise and certifications. Lastly, familiarize yourself with the platform's policies and guidelines to ensure compliance and avoid any potential issues."

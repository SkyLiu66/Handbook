        "Content": "In live streaming, emotion is paramount. The best approach is to engage in sincere empathy and personalized marketing. Continuously address and empathize with the user's pain points rather than just delivering dry content or selling products. If your live stream is solely focused on selling or providing information without emotional engagement, it will struggle to gain traction, especially for beginners. Genuine empathy and personalized marketing are crucial. For instance, if you are selling a product like bird's nest soup, don't just explain how to cook it. Emphasize the quality of the bird's nest you are selling, such as how it remains intact during cooking. This approach not only provides useful information but also subtly promotes your product's quality. Therefore, always integrate emotional engagement and product promotion in your live streams to create a more compelling and effective experience."

        "Content": "Balancing the amount of content and sales pitch in your live stream is crucial. The proportion of informative content should not exceed 50%. The core purpose of a live stream is to sell products, not to conduct a lecture. Therefore, while it's important to provide valuable information, it should be done in a way that also promotes your products. For example, when discussing a topic, subtly highlight the benefits of your products. If you are explaining how to cook bird's nest soup, mention the superior quality of your bird's nest that remains intact during cooking. This method ensures that the audience receives valuable information while also being subtly influenced to purchase your products. Always remember, the primary goal of your live stream is to sell, so keep the content informative yet promotional."

        "Content": "Preparation and interaction are key components of a successful live stream. Prepare your scripts and talking points in advance, especially if you are not naturally inclined towards self-promotion. This includes customer testimonials, product highlights, and personal stories that showcase your expertise and the quality of your products. Additionally, interaction with your audience is crucial. Engage with them through comments and questions to create a lively and engaging atmosphere. If possible, have friends or family members support you during the live stream to boost interaction. Confidence is also essential; don't be shy about selling your products. The live stream is a platform for sales, so be assertive and confident in your pitch. Lastly, don't wait for everything to be perfect before starting your live stream. Begin with what you have and improve over time. Analyze your performance after each session to identify what worked and what didn't, and make necessary adjustments. This iterative process will help you refine your approach and improve your live streaming skills over time."

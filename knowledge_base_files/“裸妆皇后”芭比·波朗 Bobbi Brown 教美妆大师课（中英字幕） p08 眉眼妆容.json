    "data": " Probably the number one question I get is how to play up your eyes. I'm gonna teach you how simple it is to fill in your brows that not only frames your face, it actually can do anything from kind of lift your eyes to just give you more strength in your makeup. I'm gonna show you how either with powder, pencil, gel, a wand, you can use any of those depending what's easiest for you. And I'm also going to show you the different tools you need and certainly the color that you need that will look the most natural and not overdone. It's really important to create the look that really fits your face. I'm gonna make it really simple. Eyes, you need three things. You need a light color, a medium color, and the darkest color. The light color goes all over the lid, the medium color goes from the lash line three-quarters of the way up, the darkest color is liner only. Even when we do smoky eye, there's a fourth layer of eye color. fourth color that comes into practice. But start with the lightest color, and that goes all over the lid. And it's different depending on your skin tone. So fair skin might go for like a white or a bone or an ivory tone, where a medium skin will go warmer tones, and then the darker skins will go even a little bit deeper. It doesn't matter if it's powder, if it's cream, if it's shimmer. There's so many different forms. Pencil. But I'm going to show you how you start with a light color, and depending on your skin color, that's where it changes. So I'm starting with the color that basically will lighten a little bit the eyelid, and it just takes all the oil out of the eyelid. It should blend in. It shouldn't be a color that's going to turn pink. It should literally just lighten up the eyelid. A medium tone would go on the eyelid, and the darkest one is used as liner. And sometimes it's used as smoky eye when blended together. But I'm going to lighten the eye, and then I'm going to show you different ways that you can do your eyes. But this is really basic. So that's the lightest. So here's a fluffy brush that just literally takes the color out of the eyelid. And then I'm going to take the color out of the eyelid. And then I'm going to take the color out of the eyelid. And then I'm going to take more on the Abe D proprio, because you can reach your lifelong glance right there. Here, I am using the backwards pounding method, and these are actually gives you another beauty fixer this winter. So you're going to take this little blue tiller and use your finger. And I'm going to leave it on, take some more of this orange on and we'll go back and then I'm going to apply this to my wider 심ples area and the veryıyı. just going to be applied close to the lash line. And the trick, honestly here, guys, because it's not complicated, it's a color and a formula that's easy to blend. The difference between the textures and eyeshadow, these are flat. They have no shimmer. These are flat. These are shimmery or metallic. Some have somewhere in between, but I'm going to start with flat. I can always add shimmer later. Flat eyeshadow is also known as matte eyeshadow, though some matte eyeshadows on the market are very dry, and they don't blend very easily, and they're not that flattering. So whatever matte or flat you choose, make sure it blends easily. Make sure it's a color that will blend into the skin. Make sure that it's just easy, because there's no reason to spend a lot of time on it. It's just a lot of time and energy trying to blend it. And by the way, you can always tap or blow on the brush. So when you do apply it to the eyelid, it's easy. And for artists out there, if when you apply it, you get a big blob of color, you either didn't blow it properly or it comes out too much. And I always start. I always start with a little bit of a brush. And I like to use a fluffy, wide brush, because it's easy, and then you're able to see where it goes. And it's got to go 3 quarters of the way up to create depth. And it just brings out the eye. And honestly, the trick is that you've got the same amount on both sides. But by applying a second amount, it's way easier than applying a darker color and having to blend it. So you apply it closed. You go right to the lash line, open the eye, and just make sure that you haven't done it on the outside, that you've created cat eyes, because that's not the purpose here. And then if you want a little bit of sparkle and fun, you can do that. OK. And then go anywhere you want with it. There's a silver you could use. You could use a brown. You could use a pinky color. And really, it just depends what look you're looking for. You can also play with some bases that are really easy to use. It's basically a cream to powder. And you could layer on top. And just add a little bit of fun and brightness to the eye. And the good news here is because they're both powdered formulas, they blend into each other. And this just kind of opens up the eye. And a lot of times, what you see in the magazines or on the runway, you see makeup that has a little bit of sheen. It may take decades of<|bo|> It's almost like wearing a pair of jeweled earrings. It's got to be just a hint, almost like it was a mistake, but it's kind of like a new fun way. And it really does open up the eyes. For evening makeup, we're going to go ahead and do some amazing makeup<|sn|>� For LOL for today, we're going to be doing some launched makeup for the Mofa series. So, we're going to tell the room about what you we've done. Welcome to Mofa Planet. Welcome to Mofa Planet. Welcome to Mofa Planet. you could add more depth you could do anything you want but I don't like to do too much eyeshadow because I would like to do an eyeliner on her mascara and then decide if I want to line underneath so it's better when you're doing makeup to build it and stop and look at it it's not about rules honestly it's about looking and knowing how to see what's working and what works one day might not work the next day before I decide to add more I'm going to line her eyes now she has the most beautiful color eyes and depending on what color you use I don't like to choose a color that gets takes away from the eyes but I do like to choose a color that's going to enhance a lot of people don't realize that eyeliner is honestly what makes the eye stand out eyeliner and mascara not as much eyeshadow people spend too much time worrying if the eyeshadow is applied properly it's really once you master liner and mascara the eyeshadow is just an enhancement and there's some women that have different issues with their eyelids either they have a big hooded lid or they have oily lids so there's many different things that you have to pay attention to when you're doing when you're doing makeup if you happen to have deep set eyes I have deep set eyes I make sure that my eyeshadow is lighter so it gives more brightness to the face she does not have deep set eyes they're actually you know really easy eyes to do and very versatile she could choose different looks so I'm gonna give you a couple options how to line the eye there is shadow and if you line with shadow you use a little bit of eyeshadow and then you're going to use a little bit of mascara and then you're going to use a little bit of mascara and then you're going to use a little bit of mascara and then you're going to use the darkest color it the darkest color it could be brown this is another brown and it could be a gray it could be black but I don't like using black shadow I'd much rather use a black pencil or black gel so these are the top line and then the underneath the eye when you line I'd rather go something a little bit lighter because it's not so intense other options for liner is a gel liner which works really well and a lot of women use a gel liner underneath the eye it's really hard to do and it's not something that I would demonstrate but some women that have certain eyelids that you see the pink from under their lids will use a gel also pencil there's so many different pencils on the market there are pencils that are powdered they're pencils that are long wear and there's pencils that are somewhere in the middle I'm not someone that likes bright colored pencils so I'm going to suggest either a brown a black or a navy and I don't mean blue I mean Navy because when it comes to liner you don't want something bright lining the eye even if you see it on the runway even if it looks very trendy of the moment you want liner that's going to literally make your eye pop so I'm going to start with a brown and I'm just softening it and the way to do liner is when you're a makeup artist gently pull up the lid but have the eye close so you can get right into the lash line and I start at the outside I gently go in and the trick is to go a little bit less dense on the inside so it's a little bit almost like it's tapered off and on the outside it's a little more and if you notice I've gone back and forth a couple times it's not just one liner you go back and you make sure it's right then you look and you open up the eye and you see if there's any spaces that have been missed you make sure that the line on the outside goes to the end but we're not doing a cat eye we're really just giving definition and this is a very dark brown I find it not easy to find good color browns because a lot of people do. A lot of browns that you buy have red in them. And when you line, it's not as intense. So if your brown isn't that dark, you can always do a brown pencil and do a black shadow or gel on top. And that's also really pretty. Okay, so I'm going to show you again on the other side. Lift the lid. And just line close to the lashes. And you don't line out in. You really line in and out. It's way easier. I usually somehow just start in the center because on the inner corner you want it to taper. And don't worry if your first few times don't work. It happens all the time. Because you can go back and fix it. And probably the hardest part is making sure the two sides align and match. So I could see right now this one goes out a little, which is quite beautiful, but not what we're showing. And I also noticed that I needed a little bit more on the inside. So that's pretty good, I have to say. I'm also going to teach you how to double line. I'm going to use a teeny bit of the gel. Just on top. And it just deepens it. And really it just depends on how strong you want your eyeliner. The difference between gel and liquid is really simple. Liquid, I find as a makeup artist, is really hard to control. It's really hard to control. It's really hard to control. It's really hard to control. It's really hard to control. It's really hard to control. It's really hard to control. I cannot do a great line with a liquid. It's easier with one of the felt pens that are eyeliners that you could use for a certain look. But for everyday makeup, pencil, powder, and gel are my three favorites. And there's a lot of gels on the market. Some of them dry out too quickly. Some are too wet. You want to make sure that they're not too dry. You want to make sure it's one that pretty much is center of it. So that is one easy, simple way to do an eye. It's light color all over, a medium color on our lid, two different formulas, a liner. You could do one or two. You do one, you do the other. And you try to make them look equal. But then you look and decide which one you like better. And you can always adjust. Don't go anywhere without a cotton swab. Really hard to find. But I love the cotton swab. I love the cotton swabs that have wood on them. They're really great because they don't bend. And they have just the right amount of cotton on the end of it. They're really good. So use a Q-tip before you use any kind of eye makeup remover because that really could make a mess. And by the way, if you're a new makeup artist, you might want to do the eyes first because if you make a mess on the face, your concealer will definitely be ruined. But you always have a minute to fix it. So you don't have to go back and fix it. So mistakes happen all the time. I've seen, you know, eyeliners that didn't get close to the lashes. But don't worry because then you look and you could see it needs to be added. I've seen some that are just way too thick for the eye. And you can actually make it thinner. I also recommend making sure that you start where you could see it. And a lot of women that have deep set eyes or almost no eyes, they're going to have a lot of dark circles. And if you have deep set eyes or almost hooded eyes, if you line their eyes and when they open their eyes, if you can't see it, then you have to make it a little thicker. So that's again, you have to look and you have to understand it. And almost all women have eyes that are different sizes. Especially as we get older, the eyes, things change. And for some reason, one might drop sooner than the other. You can adjust. You can make the liner on the smaller eye a little thicker. And that usually balances out. But it happens quite often. And it unfortunately happens to women that have had too much Botox. Their eyes are different. So you have to go in and make some corrections. And those are the things you learn when you're a makeup artist. Now, mascara is really simple. It should be black. I don't care if your lashes are fair, you're a redhead, you're 14 years old, you're 12 years old. Mascara should be black. That doesn't mean you need a lot of it. But lashes are supposed to be black. So there are brown mascaras on the market. I find them wimpy. There are blue mascaras on the market. I just don't understand looking at someone with blue mascara. And there's all sorts of colored mascaras. Also, there are black mascaras. There are black mascaras on the market that are really not black. So the trick is to find one that is really, really black. And honestly, how do you know if it's really black? You have to try it. But when you find a really black one, it makes a big difference. And wands, by the way. Some mascaras, the wand is curved. I like a thicker wand because I find it makes the lashes thicker. Some are straight. When it's tapered, it's great because you could use the end of it. And you could just put it on the inner corner. So you use the black. You pull it out. And you literally make sure there's no goo left on it. You could either put it on a tissue or you could just do it right in the tube. And when applying mascara, again, you hold the eyelid. Open and look down. You hold the eyelid. And as a makeup artist, this protects her eye. So if she did blink, then we wouldn't notice. And it wouldn't get in her eye. Now, I like to separate the lashes as I go. And if you notice, I didn't curl her lashes. I curl lashes often. Her lashes were actually curled today. But I have a trick that I'm going to show you, the best way to curl lashes. So that's one coat. And for some people, that's enough. They'd say, oh, that's a lot. But I like to apply two to three coats of mascara. Even for someone that likes to curl their lashes. Even for someone that likes a nude minimal makeup. I find mascara is the greatest way to open up your eyes. And I find that depending what kind of hair you have on your head, that often has a lot to do with what kind of lashes you have. Many Asian women have very, very thin lashes and very thick hair. Many women who have coarser hair on their head have super curly, great lashes. And the one thing that happens as a woman gets older is the lashes get less strong, just like your hair. But mascara makes all the difference. So that's two coats. And if you notice, I'm only doing the top right now because if I was to do the bottom, she would get it all over her eyes. But see the difference? It just really makes your eyes pop. Now some women as they're applying the mascara are kind of messy. So they might need to have like a spoolie. It's great to have one of these spoolies, we call them, because you could use them if your lashes get stuck together. You could use them for your eyebrows. And I've even seen some makeup artists get chia seeds out of models' teeth with them. Clean, of course. And then I'm going to do the same thing. And I learned how important mascara is to get it on right. When I was a young makeup artist before there was anything digital, I used to use the binoculars. I used to sit on the end of the area where people were taking pictures and I would look at the binoculars. It's a great way to really see what needs to be done. So I would consider this a very pretty, basic eye. It could be built up if anyone wanted to do anything stronger. But I love it and I don't think I would draw underneath. Now why do people draw top and bottom? I do top and bottom. It makes my eyes bigger. She doesn't need it. I think it would be too much makeup on her. But the trick is if you are going to line top and bottom, make sure the top is thicker and way thicker. Okay. And way, way softer on the bottom. And my trick is after you've done mascara, when it's drying, you literally hold the lashes and that will curl the lashes. Honestly, that's how I do it on myself and on models. Because I find it very difficult to curl the lashes. It's one of those things I usually ask someone else to do. But I find that I could do just as good job after the mascara is on. Sometimes I do brows first. Sometimes I do them second. It doesn't really matter. But I'm going to show you how easy it is to do an eyebrow and how to make it look natural. You could use an eye shadow. You could use a formula specifically for eyebrows. Sometimes it's a little waxier than shadow. You can also use a pencil. Now there's a lot of pencils that you could use. These are specifically for brows. Slanted with a really nice spoolie on the end. I like to use a shadow. Because I find that you can use the same shadow you used as your eye shadow often. And it's just easier. Also, you have to know that sometimes you need two shadows. And when doing brows, you start at the inside. You brush up. You fill it in. And then I use the shadow to just pretty much create the shape that will make the eye stand out. I brush the hair up. I create the arch. And often women need to go down and make a little bit more of a tail. Okay. Now I'll talk color in a second. But I don't like a very overdone brow. So if you ever do your brows and it gets a little overdone, you could either take powder and soften it. You could certainly use the spoolie. Now Anna has a couple different colors in her hair. She has brown. She has a little lighter brown. And a little bit of slate. So I try to find something that goes with her hair. All of them. So I'm just going to add a little bit of ash brown in it so it's not just gray. It's not uncommon that when you do a brow it gets a little bit dark. Sometimes you actually have to make it a little dark to fill it in. And then you soften it. So there's a couple ways to do it. One of the great makeup artist tricks is to take your face powder and brush it in. And that will take the edge off. And it looks a little bit more diffused. So I think that's perfect. So I'm going to do the other side. A mistake a lot of women make is when they're filling in brows they don't use the whole brow. So I am using the beginning of the brow. Brushing up so it's almost like square here. I'm brushing the hair up. And then you want to also fill in the hair but then really use the makeup to create an arch and go down. The eyebrow should start at the inner corner and it should go all the way down to frame the eye. And the center of it should be three quarters of the way. That's where the arch should be. And then we're going to brush and soften it. And again this just takes the edge off anything that's darker. And no one's eyebrows are the same. You've got to make sure that when you look at them you make them match. Hers are pretty close. So that's the simple way to do eyes and brows. I want to do one more thing. Sometimes it's really fun to add a little bit more of sparkle even on your day eye. Sparkle is not just for evening or black tie. It's for the whole look. So in closing, not that difficult. For eyes, light shadow, medium shadow, darkest shadow. Light all over. Medium on the lid. The darkest is the liner. Don't be afraid to layer different formulas, different textures, different colors. Mascara only black. And then eyebrows, fill them in. Use the entire brow. Brush them up. And just make sure it enhances. It lifts the eye and it's not too dark.",

This involves finding a popular post or note that aligns with your goals. Once you have identified the content, take a screenshot of it. This screenshot will serve as your reference for the next steps. Identifying popular content is crucial because it provides a proven template that has already resonated with a large audience. By starting with content that has already been successful, you increase your chances of creating equally engaging and effective material. Make sure to choose content that is relevant to your niche and audience to maximize its impact."

Once the text is extracted, copy it and paste it into a text editor. Remove any unnecessary parts and organize the text into a coherent format. Pay special attention to the title and main content, ensuring they are clearly separated. This process allows you to quickly and efficiently replicate the structure and wording of popular content, making it easier to create your own version."

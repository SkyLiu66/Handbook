        "Content": "To start on Xiaohongshu, it's crucial to have a safe and secure account. Ensure your device and network are clean, meaning they haven't been flagged for previous violations. Avoid frequently switching between multiple accounts on the same device. Use a new device and a new phone number if necessary. Register your account and avoid linking too many social media accounts initially. This helps prevent the platform from flagging your account as suspicious. If you have an old account that hasn't been used for violations, you can use it to start. However, avoid using virtual numbers or multiple account logins on the same device, as these can lead to low traffic or account restrictions. Ensure your phone number can receive SMS for verification purposes."

Use a concealer that is one shade lighter than your foundation to brighten under the eyes and cover dark circles. Apply it close to the lash line and on the inner corners of the eyes to open up the area. For blemishes and spots, use a complexion pencil or a cream formula that matches your foundation. Pat the concealer gently with your fingers to blend it seamlessly into the skin. By effectively using concealer and corrector, you can achieve a fresh and awake appearance, making your skin look healthier and more radiant."

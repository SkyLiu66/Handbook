The cover image's importance is comparable to that of the title, as it is the first visual element users see. To create a compelling cover image, you can use various tools such as Chuangketie, Canva, or even PowerPoint. Start by setting the correct dimensions, typically 1080x1439 pixels for Xiaohongshu. You can choose between two styles: a collage of images or a simple text-based design. For a collage, gather relevant images and arrange them cohesively. For a text-based design, select a background color or image, add a prominent title, and ensure the text is readable and visually appealing. Experiment with different fonts, sizes, and colors to make the cover image stand out. Adding personalized elements like watermarks or small icons can also enhance the cover's uniqueness."

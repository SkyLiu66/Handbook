This system involves categorizing users based on various criteria such as the date they joined, their source channel, and their current engagement status. For instance, you can tag users as 'New', 'Interested', 'Consulting', or 'High Intent' based on their interactions with your content. This helps in understanding the user's journey and tailoring your communication accordingly. Additionally, using tools like enterprise WeChat or other CRM systems can automate this process, making it easier to manage large volumes of users. By implementing a robust tagging system, you can ensure that your marketing efforts are targeted and effective, ultimately leading to higher conversion rates."

Start by listing all the resources you have at your disposal, including skills, knowledge, network, and products. For instance, if you have a family business in clothing manufacturing, you can showcase the production process and sell the products online. If you have connections with influencers or celebrities, leverage those relationships to boost your visibility. Even if you are a stay-at-home parent, you can create content around parenting tips or daily life hacks. The idea is to maximize the use of what you already have to create valuable content. Additionally, identify any gaps in your skills or resources and seek ways to fill them, either through learning or collaboration. By strategically using your resources, you can create a strong foundation for your Xiaohongshu presence."

        "Content": "Artificial intervention involves strategically guiding potential customers to engage with your product and ultimately make a purchase. This process can be broken down into several steps. First, ensure that your product is added to the customer's cart. If a customer views your product on the first day, they might not see it again the next day. Therefore, direct them to your profile and encourage them to add the product to their cart. On the second day, have them revisit your profile and proceed to the cart. If they are new customers, guide them through the process of adding the product to the cart. On the third day, they can finalize the purchase. This method helps in building trust and increasing the likelihood of a sale. Additionally, encourage customers to leave comments and reviews, which can further enhance the credibility of your product."

        "Content": "Customer reviews and sales data play a crucial role in building trust and encouraging new customers to make a purchase. When potential buyers see that a product has been sold multiple times and has positive reviews, they are more likely to trust the product and make a purchase. To achieve this, you can ask friends or loyal customers to purchase your product and leave positive reviews. Ensure that the reviews are genuine and reflect the quality of the product. Additionally, you can manipulate the sales data by having friends purchase multiple units of the product. This will show higher sales numbers, which can attract more customers. However, it's important to maintain authenticity and avoid any practices that could be considered fraudulent."

        "Content": "Effective logistics and follow-up reviews are essential for maintaining customer satisfaction and encouraging repeat purchases. Once a customer has added a product to their cart and made a purchase, ensure that the product is delivered promptly. You can use platforms like Pinduoduo to purchase inexpensive items and use their logistics information to update your own system. This ensures that the customer receives accurate tracking information. After the product is delivered, encourage the customer to leave a follow-up review. You can provide them with sample review content and images to make the process easier. These follow-up reviews, known as 'show-off notes,' can significantly increase the credibility of your product and attract more customers. Aim to accumulate multiple positive reviews to boost your product's visibility and trustworthiness."

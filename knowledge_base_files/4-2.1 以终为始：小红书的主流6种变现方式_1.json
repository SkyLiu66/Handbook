        "Content": "Xiaohongshu offers six primary monetization methods: advertising, opening a store, local life services, knowledge-based courses, live streaming, and private domain monetization. Advertising involves using the Pugongying platform to connect creators with brands, requiring at least 1,000 followers. Opening a store is accessible with just an ID, allowing individuals to sell products. Local life services, similar to group buying and beauty services, are currently in beta testing in major cities. Knowledge-based courses involve selling skills or expertise, often through live streaming. Live streaming allows for direct product sales and can be done without a follower threshold. Private domain monetization involves using Xiaohongshu to attract customers and then converting them in a private domain, useful for high-consideration purchases like home renovation."

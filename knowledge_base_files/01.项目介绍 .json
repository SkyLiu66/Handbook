        "Content": "The project focuses on providing English CET-4 and CET-6 materials to university students, who are required to pass these exams for graduation and future opportunities such as civil service exams, postgraduate studies, and job applications. The demand for these materials is high because students need to pass the CET-4 before they can take the CET-6, and they can retake the exams multiple times to achieve the best score. The project capitalizes on this consistent demand, especially at the beginning of the academic year when new students are eager to start their preparation. This high demand ensures a steady stream of potential customers, making the project viable and profitable."

        "Content": "The project has long-term viability due to the consistent demand for English CET-4 and CET-6 materials. University students are required to pass these exams, and new students enroll every year, ensuring a continuous market. The exams are held twice a year, in June and December, providing regular opportunities for sales. Additionally, students who fail the exams often retake them, further increasing the demand for study materials. This cyclical nature of the exams and the constant influx of new students make the project sustainable over the long term. By consistently providing valuable materials, the project can maintain a steady customer base and generate ongoing revenue."

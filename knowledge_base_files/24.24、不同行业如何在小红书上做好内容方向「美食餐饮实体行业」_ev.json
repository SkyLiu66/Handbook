        "Content": "Leveraging ordinary users, or '素人' (suren), for brand promotion can significantly enhance the authenticity and trustworthiness of your brand. Unlike influencers or professional promoters, ordinary users share their experiences from a genuine perspective, which can resonate more with potential customers. To utilize this strategy, encourage your existing customers to share their experiences on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book). For instance, if you own a restaurant, you can offer discounts or special deals to customers who post about their dining experience. This user-generated content acts as social proof, making your brand appear more reliable and appealing. Additionally, ordinary users typically have smaller follower counts, which means their posts are perceived as more genuine and less commercial. This grassroots approach can help in building a loyal customer base and increasing brand visibility organically."

        "Content": "Optimizing brand accounts on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu involves several key steps. First, ensure that your account is officially verified. This requires submitting a business license and a certification fee. A verified account can aggregate user-generated content (UGC) and Key Opinion Leader (KOL) content, making it more visible and credible. Additionally, verified accounts can create brand-specific topics and invite users to participate, further increasing engagement. When setting up your brand account, focus on creating a persona that resonates with your target audience. This could be the business owner, a local expert, or a friendly staff member. The content should be a mix of updates about your business, local news, and user-generated content. This approach makes the account more relatable and engaging. Lastly, use keywords strategically to improve search rankings and visibility. By optimizing your brand account, you can effectively increase your reach and engagement on social media."

        "Content": "Utilizing location-based features on platforms like Xiaohongshu can significantly enhance your business's visibility and attract local customers. Start by ensuring your business is listed on Tencent Maps, as Xiaohongshu pulls location data from there. Once your business is listed, encourage customers to tag your location in their posts. This can be done by offering incentives like discounts or special deals for those who share their experience and tag your business. Additionally, focus on creating content that highlights your location. For example, if you run a restaurant in Shanghai, create posts about local attractions, food guides, and events. This not only attracts local customers but also tourists looking for recommendations. Use popular local keywords to improve your search rankings. The more people tag and mention your location, the higher your business will appear in local search results. By effectively utilizing location-based features, you can increase foot traffic and enhance your business's local presence."

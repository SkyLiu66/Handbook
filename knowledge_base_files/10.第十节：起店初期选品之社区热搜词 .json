        "Content": "When starting on Xiaohongshu, it's crucial to select three to five popular products from competitors to kickstart your account. Each product should be promoted for four to five days. This approach leverages Xiaohongshu's algorithm, which favors popular items by frequently showing them to users who have previously interacted with similar content. By choosing products that already have high exposure, you increase the likelihood of your posts being seen, clicked on, and ultimately leading to sales. This method ensures that your initial efforts are focused on items with proven demand, maximizing your chances of gaining traction on the platform."

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu operates on an exposure logic rather than a push logic like Douyin. This means that the platform shows users content based on their previous interactions. For example, if a user frequently engages with posts about a specific product, Xiaohongshu will continue to show similar posts to that user. This is why it's essential to choose products that already have high exposure. By doing so, you tap into an existing audience that is more likely to engage with your content. The key metrics to focus on are exposure (how often your post is shown), clicks (how many users click on your post), and conversions (how many users make a purchase)."

        "Content": "Community hot search terms on Xiaohongshu can be a valuable tool for selecting products. These terms reflect what users are currently searching for the most. By aligning your product titles and content with these hot search terms, you can increase your posts' exposure. To find these terms, navigate to the 'Xiaohongshu Sign' section in the merchant management backend and look for the 'Community Hot Search Terms' section. Choose terms related to your product category and incorporate them into your posts. This strategy helps ensure that your content is relevant and more likely to be seen by a larger audience, thereby increasing your chances of driving traffic and sales."

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu's primary audience consists of two main groups: young women aged 18-25 and middle-aged women aged 25-40. The younger group, often referred to as the 'resilient generation,' includes women from both urban and rural areas who are more open to new internet platforms. They prefer trendy, high-appearance products with good cost-performance ratios. The older group, termed 'senior middle class,' is concentrated in first and second-tier cities and values high-quality, ritualistic, and niche products. Understanding these demographics helps in tailoring product selections to meet their preferences and increase sales effectiveness."

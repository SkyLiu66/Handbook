            "Content": "To navigate the newbie phase on Xiaohongshu effectively, start by understanding the importance of product selection. A mature live streaming room often features a mix of low-priced, mid-priced, and high-priced products. These products serve different purposes: some are for attracting traffic (welfare products), some for generating profit (profit products), and others for enhancing the overall appeal (green leaf products). Welfare products, for instance, are low-profit items designed to boost interaction and conversion rates. They help break the initial barrier with users, making them more likely to purchase higher-priced items later. Marketing products, on the other hand, are highly attractive items used to draw in users and increase engagement. By strategically using these different types of products, you can effectively grow your account and increase your reach."

            "Content": "Marketing products are essential for drawing in users and increasing engagement on Xiaohongshu. These products are typically highly attractive and offer great value, making them irresistible to users. For example, a marketing product might be a highly discounted item that appears too good to be true. The goal is to attract users' attention and encourage them to interact with your content. Once users are engaged, you can use other products to convert this engagement into sales. It's important to note that marketing products should not be overused, as they can lead to financial losses if not managed properly. Instead, use them strategically to boost initial engagement and then transition users to higher-priced, profit-generating products."

            "Keywords": ["welfare products", "profit products", "Xiaohongshu"],
            "Content": "Balancing welfare and profit products is crucial for maintaining a healthy profit margin while keeping users engaged. Welfare products are low-profit items designed to attract users and encourage initial purchases. These products help break down users' initial resistance, making them more likely to purchase higher-priced items later. Profit products, on the other hand, are designed to generate revenue. These items are typically higher-priced and offer better margins. By strategically placing welfare products alongside profit products, you can create a seamless shopping experience that encourages users to make multiple purchases. This approach not only boosts your sales but also helps build a loyal customer base."

        "Content": "Monetizing through private domains, such as personal social media accounts, involves a strategic approach to content and user engagement. After attracting users from public platforms to your private domain, such as a personal WeChat account, it's crucial to maintain consistency in branding and identity. This consistency builds trust and credibility. The content shared in private domains should be carefully curated to enhance the user's experience and foster a sense of trust. This includes sharing high-quality product images, customer testimonials, and engaging in meaningful interactions. Additionally, it's important to avoid overwhelming users with too many posts or purely promotional content. Instead, a balanced mix of personal stories, professional insights, and promotional content can keep the audience engaged and more likely to convert. By strategically managing your private domain, you can create a seamless and trustworthy experience that encourages users to make purchases and remain loyal to your brand."

        "Content": "To find benchmark accounts on Xiaohongshu, you can use several methods. First, utilize the search function. For example, if you want to create a custom avatar account, type 'avatar' in the search bar and filter the top 50 accounts to find suitable benchmarks. Second, explore the homepage channels. Expand the channels to find relevant categories, such as the avatar channel, and identify your peers. Third, after browsing related accounts for a while, the system will recommend more similar accounts based on your interests. Fourth, use third-party platforms like QianGua, HuiTun, and XinBang to search for avatars. However, these platforms often require a membership fee, making them less cost-effective for beginners. By using these methods, you can quickly find benchmark accounts to guide your content creation."

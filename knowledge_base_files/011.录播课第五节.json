Regular updates keep the audience engaged and signal to the platform's algorithm that the account is active, which can lead to better visibility and higher engagement rates. For instance, an account that posts daily or several times a week is more likely to attract and retain followers compared to one that posts sporadically. Consistency also helps in building a reliable content calendar, ensuring that followers know when to expect new content. This regularity can lead to increased trust and loyalty among the audience."

Additionally, understanding the types of advertisements competitors receive can provide clues about potential monetization opportunities. This analysis helps in refining one's content strategy and making informed decisions to improve performance."

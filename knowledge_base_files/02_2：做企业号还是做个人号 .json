        "Content": "Setting up a Xiaohongshu account is straightforward. Personal accounts can be registered with just a phone number and do not require real-name verification unless you plan to make payments. However, it is recommended to verify your account, especially if you are setting up a business account. Business accounts require a business license, and one license can be used to verify up to three business accounts. Each account can open a store, but it is crucial to verify the account as a professional account before opening the store to avoid complications. Business accounts have several advantages, including the ability to send more private messages daily and access to promotional tools like the 'JuGuang' platform. To maintain a white-list status on JuGuang, you need to spend a certain amount regularly. Initially, you need to deposit a specific amount, and subsequent accounts require lower deposits. Regular spending ensures you remain on the white-list, which is essential for effective promotions."

        "Content": "Managing multiple accounts on Xiaohongshu can be highly effective, especially for businesses in niche markets. The primary reason for using multiple accounts is to increase the chances of content visibility and engagement. Each account can target different segments of your audience, ensuring broader coverage. Additionally, the platform's algorithm tests content with initial exposure, and having multiple accounts increases the likelihood of some content performing well. This strategy also mitigates the risk of account suspension or penalties, as issues with one account won't affect the others. For businesses, it's essential to balance the number of accounts with the team's capacity to manage them effectively. Using a matrix approach, where each account focuses on specific content types or audience segments, can optimize performance. Regularly updating and engaging with each account ensures sustained growth and visibility. This approach requires careful planning and consistent execution but can significantly enhance your presence on Xiaohongshu."

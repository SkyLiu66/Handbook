            "Content": "After downloading high-quality, watermark-free videos, it's essential to edit them properly to avoid being flagged as reposted content on platforms like Xiaohongshu. One effective method is the 'Sandwich Editing Technique.' Start by opening a video editing software like Jianying. Create a new project and import your downloaded video. To apply the 'Sandwich Editing Technique,' first, add a photo or video taken with your phone as the base layer. Adjust the aspect ratio to match the platform's requirements (e.g., 3:4 for Xiaohongshu). Next, add your downloaded video as a picture-in-picture layer and slightly adjust its size and position. Finally, add another photo or video on top, adjust its size, and blend it using the 'Overlay' mode. This technique ensures your video appears original and is less likely to be flagged. Adjust the video's parameters like brightness, contrast, and saturation to match the original quality. Export the video at 60 frames per second for the best quality."

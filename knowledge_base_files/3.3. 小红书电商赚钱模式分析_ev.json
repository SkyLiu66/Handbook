        "Content": "E-commerce monetization on Xiaohongshu involves setting up a store and conducting live streams to sell products. Although the platform's users have not yet fully adopted the habit of quickly browsing live streams, this is expected to change over time. Similar to how Douyin (TikTok) and Kuaishou transitioned from entertainment platforms to e-commerce giants, Xiaohongshu is on a similar path. Initially, these platforms relied heavily on advertisements, but eventually, they opened up e-commerce opportunities. Currently, the primary focus for Xiaohongshu users should be on establishing and maintaining a store. Live streaming, while not yet a major traffic driver, holds potential for the future as user habits evolve. By starting early and building a strong presence, sellers can benefit from increased sales and higher platform rankings over time. This approach ensures that when live streaming becomes more popular, they will already have a solid foundation to capitalize on the trend."

        "Content": "Advertising is another significant revenue stream on Xiaohongshu, primarily for Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs). These influencers can leverage their large followings to attract brands looking to promote their products. Unlike regular users, KOLs have the advantage of a built-in audience that trusts their recommendations, making them ideal partners for advertising campaigns. For those who are not influencers, this revenue stream might not be as accessible. However, understanding the potential of advertising can help users aspire to grow their influence on the platform. By consistently creating high-quality content and engaging with their audience, users can gradually build a following that could eventually attract advertising opportunities. This approach requires patience and dedication but can be highly rewarding in the long run. As the platform continues to grow, the demand for advertising space will likely increase, providing more opportunities for users to monetize their influence."

        "Content": "Private traffic monetization on Xiaohongshu involves directing followers to private channels, such as WeChat groups, to facilitate direct sales. This method allows sellers to bypass platform fees and have more control over their customer interactions. For example, a store selling shoes on Xiaohongshu can create a fan group and invite followers to join. Once in the group, the seller can engage with customers more personally, answer their questions, and promote new products. Transactions can then be completed directly through WeChat, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This approach not only reduces costs but also fosters customer loyalty, as buyers appreciate the direct and personalized service. Additionally, it allows for immediate payment and simplifies the return process. By building a strong private traffic network, sellers can ensure a steady stream of repeat customers and create a more sustainable business model. This strategy is particularly effective for niche markets where personalized service and customer relationships are crucial."

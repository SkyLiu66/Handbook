        "Content": "To identify fake engagement on Xiaohongshu, analyze both static and dynamic data. Static data includes metrics like followers, likes, comments, and shares. Genuine engagement typically shows a balanced ratio, such as 20 likes for every comment. If these numbers are unusually high or identical, it may indicate fake engagement. Dynamic data involves monitoring the growth of followers and interactions over time. Sudden spikes in followers or engagement without corresponding content quality improvements suggest artificial boosting. Additionally, examine the comments for authenticity. Genuine comments are often detailed and relevant, while fake ones are generic and repetitive. By scrutinizing these data points, brands can better assess the true influence of a Xiaohongshu account."

        "Content": "Monitoring dynamic data is essential for verifying the authenticity of a Xiaohongshu account. This involves tracking the growth of followers and engagement over time. Use data monitoring tools to observe these metrics over weekly or monthly periods. Genuine accounts typically show steady growth, while sudden, unexplained spikes may indicate artificial boosting. Additionally, analyze the interaction patterns within the first 24 hours of a post. High-quality posts usually start with slow growth, followed by a rapid increase if they perform well in initial smaller recommendation pools. In contrast, artificially boosted posts often show unnatural, consistent growth patterns. By carefully monitoring these dynamic data points, brands can better assess the authenticity and influence of Xiaohongshu accounts."

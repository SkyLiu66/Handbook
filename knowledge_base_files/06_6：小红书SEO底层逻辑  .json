        "Content": "SEO (Search Engine Optimization) on Xiaohongshu is crucial for gaining visibility and driving traffic to your content. Xiaohongshu's search traffic is significant, with over 40% of users relying on search to find information. Many users treat Xiaohongshu like a search engine, similar to how they use Baidu. For example, users often search for solutions to personal issues, such as skin allergies or product recommendations. To capture this search traffic, it's essential to understand the platform's SEO logic. The core of Xiaohongshu's SEO is keyword matching. The weight of keyword matching in the title is higher than in the content, and the content's keyword matching weight is higher than that of the tags. Therefore, having relevant keywords in your title is critical for ranking higher in search results. By optimizing your content for search, you can increase your visibility and attract more users to your posts."

        ],
        "Content": "Effective keyword matching is the cornerstone of successful SEO on Xiaohongshu. The platform prioritizes keyword relevance in the title, followed by the content and then the tags. For instance, if a user searches for 'How to open a store on Xiaohongshu,' a post with the title 'Xiaohongshu Store Opening Guide' will rank higher than one titled 'Xiaohongshu Operations Guide,' even if both contain similar content. This is because the former has a higher keyword matching weight in the title. To leverage this, you should conduct thorough keyword research using tools like Grey Data or Chang Xiaohong to identify popular search terms in your niche. Incorporate these keywords naturally into your titles and content to improve your chances of ranking higher. Avoid keyword stuffing, as the system can detect and penalize irrelevant keyword usage. By focusing on relevant and high-frequency keywords, you can enhance your content's visibility and attract more targeted traffic."

        "Content": "Maintaining and boosting search rankings on Xiaohongshu involves a combination of strategic content creation and engagement. One effective method is to regularly publish new posts, as Xiaohongshu has a rotation mechanism similar to the listing and delisting system on platforms like Taobao. New posts are given initial exposure, and if they perform well in terms of click-through rates and engagement, they receive more visibility. Additionally, you can use tools like Qingdou APP to manage tasks such as collecting comments and likes to maintain your post's ranking. Engaging with your audience through comments and likes can also help improve your post's interaction rate, which is a key factor in the ranking algorithm. For high-value posts, consider using private networks to boost engagement metrics. However, the most sustainable strategy is to consistently create high-quality, keyword-optimized content that naturally attracts and retains user interest. This approach ensures long-term visibility and engagement on the platform."

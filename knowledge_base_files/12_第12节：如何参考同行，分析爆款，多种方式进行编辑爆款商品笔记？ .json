        "Content": "Identifying best-selling products involves analyzing various metrics such as time, likes, and sales volume. For example, a post that has garnered over 1,000 likes in a month or 500 likes in a week is likely a best-seller. Additionally, consider the seasonality of the product; a product that sells well in winter may not perform as well in summer. Look at the sales volume of individual products; if a product has sold over 1,000 units, it is worth considering as a best-seller. By focusing on these metrics, you can identify products that have a high potential for success and tailor your marketing strategies accordingly."

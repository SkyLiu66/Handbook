Choose your identity type (individual or business) and select a category, such as women's clothing. Once registered, configure your store settings, including the store logo and name, which should align with your Xiaohongshu account details. Next, set up logistics by managing your shipping address and return address. You can use your own address initially, but it's advisable to use the supplier's address for drop shipping. After setting up logistics, source products from platforms like Taobao, 1688, or Pinduoduo. You can manually upload products or use software to automate the process. Ensure you set up shipping templates to define which regions are eligible for free shipping. Finally, configure customer service settings, including automated responses and manual customer service options, to handle inquiries efficiently."

        "Content": "Setting up product details and pricing is crucial for a successful store. After fetching product details from 1688, you need to configure several settings. First, ensure the brand is set to 'None' if the product is unbranded. This avoids potential legal issues with branded products. Next, adjust the product price. A common strategy is to set the price at 200% of the original cost plus an additional 5-10 yuan. This markup covers your profit margin and potential discounts, such as coupons. For example, if a product costs 40 yuan on 1688, set the price to around 100 yuan. Configure the shipping template to 'Non-remote areas free shipping' to attract more customers. Select your shipping address and ensure it is correctly set up. These steps ensure that your products are correctly priced and detailed, making them attractive to potential buyers."

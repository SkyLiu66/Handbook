            "Content": "To maximize the effectiveness of your posts on Xiaohongshu, it's important to consider the optimal posting times and frequency. For product-related notes, different categories have specific peak times. For example, for furniture-related posts, the best times are between 8-10 AM and 12-2 PM, as the target audience (often mothers) is most active during these hours. For fashion-related posts, aim for 11 AM-1 PM and 6-10 PM, as young women tend to be more active during these times. The key is to post when your target audience is most likely to be online and engaged. Additionally, understanding the 'golden hours'—times when user activity is highest—can significantly boost your post's visibility and engagement."

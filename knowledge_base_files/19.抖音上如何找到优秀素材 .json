        "Content": "To find quality content on TikTok, start by understanding that your competitors are your best teachers. Register a new TikTok account tailored to your target audience. For example, if you are in the children's clothing niche, create an account focused on that demographic. Engage with relevant content by liking and commenting to train the algorithm to show you more of the same. This method helps you discover high-quality content that you can adapt and innovate upon. Additionally, use tools like 'Kao Gu Jia' to search for specific types of content, such as e-commerce videos. Look for accounts with low follower counts but high engagement rates, as these indicate successful content. By following these steps, you can efficiently gather and utilize quality content from TikTok to enhance your own social media strategy."

        "Content": "'Kao Gu Jia' is a valuable tool for discovering content on TikTok. To use it effectively, start by searching for keywords related to your niche, such as 'children's clothing.' Filter the results to focus on e-commerce videos, which are more likely to feature product promotions. Analyze the data provided, such as the number of followers, likes, comments, and shares. Prioritize accounts with fewer than 50,000 followers but high engagement rates, as these are likely to have high-quality content. Avoid accounts with millions of followers, as their success may be due to their personal brand rather than the quality of their content. By using 'Kao Gu Jia,' you can find and follow accounts that consistently produce engaging and effective content, which you can then adapt for your own use."

        "Content": "Adapting and innovating content from TikTok involves several strategic steps. First, identify high-performing content by looking for videos with high engagement rates but from accounts with fewer followers. This indicates that the content itself is compelling. Once you find such content, analyze the elements that make it successful, such as the format, style, and presentation. Adapt these elements to fit your brand and audience. For example, if a particular style of product demonstration is popular, try to replicate it with your own products. Additionally, don't rush to innovate immediately. Start by closely following successful content to understand what works. Over time, you can introduce your own unique twists and innovations. By systematically adapting and innovating content, you can create engaging and effective posts that resonate with your audience."

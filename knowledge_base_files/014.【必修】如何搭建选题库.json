            "Content": "To build an effective topic library, start by understanding why it's essential. The topic you choose significantly impacts whether your content will go viral. The title and cover are important, but the topic is even more crucial. Viral topics often tap into human nature, such as the desire for shortcuts, free resources, or financial gain. To create viral content, you must borrow successful topics but ensure the core is your own. Topics should not be randomly thought up; they must be validated by the market. Search for your topic keywords on Xiaohongshu to see if they have been successful. Your topic library acts as your ammunition; without it, you may struggle to create content consistently. Regularly update your topic library by surfing Xiaohongshu with a creative mindset, analyzing why certain content goes viral, and adding validated topics to your library."

            "Content": "To create good content, validate your topics before diving into content creation. Randomly thinking of topics while walking or showering is not effective. Instead, search for your topic keywords on Xiaohongshu to see if they have been validated by the market. If you find a promising topic, check if similar content has high engagement. This step ensures that your efforts in creating titles, covers, and content are not wasted. Additionally, maintain a habit of building a topic library. This library should be regularly updated with validated topics, ensuring you always have a pool of ideas to draw from. This approach prevents last-minute scrambles for ideas and helps you create content that resonates with your audience. Remember, a well-validated topic is more likely to succeed and attract engagement."

            "Content": "To generate a diverse range of topic ideas, leverage multiple channels. Don't rely solely on a few benchmark accounts for topic ideas. Instead, use various sources such as trending keywords, community hot search terms, and third-party tools. For example, search for keywords related to your niche on Xiaohongshu and analyze the top-performing content. Additionally, use tools like the 'Houyi Collector' to gather data on trending topics. This approach ensures that your topic library is filled with a variety of ideas, increasing the chances of finding a viral topic. Regularly update your topic library by adding new ideas and removing outdated ones. This habit ensures that you always have fresh and relevant topics to create content around. By diversifying your sources, you can create content that appeals to a broader audience and stays relevant to current trends."

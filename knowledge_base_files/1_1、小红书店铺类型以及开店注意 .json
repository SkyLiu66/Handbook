        "Content": "On Xiaohongshu, opening a store requires a professional account, which can be either personal or enterprise. A personal professional account is free and requires real-name verification with an ID card. This type of account allows individuals to open a personal store and also assist other influencers with product promotions. On the other hand, an enterprise professional account requires an annual certification fee of 600 RMB and a business license. This account type does not need personal ID verification and allows one business license to open up to three stores. Enterprise accounts are ideal for those looking to manage multiple stores, as they can leverage the business license to open several stores without additional ID verification. Additionally, enterprise accounts can distribute their products through other influencers, making it a versatile option for larger operations."

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu offers several types of stores: personal stores, individual business stores, ordinary enterprise stores, specialty stores, and flagship stores. Personal stores require an ID card, bank card, and phone number, and they can only sell a limited range of products. If more product categories are needed, the store can be upgraded to an individual business store, which requires a business license. Individual business stores can open up to three stores per license and do not require personal ID verification. Ordinary enterprise stores can sell a wider range of products but require higher security deposits, ranging from 2,000 to 50,000 RMB. Specialty stores can sell multiple authorized brands, while flagship stores are for selling products under a single brand. Each store type has different requirements and benefits, making it important to choose the one that best fits your business needs."

        ],
        "Content": "Xiaohongshu's platform fees are structured to support small sellers. If your monthly sales are less than 10,000 RMB, there are no service charges. However, if sales exceed this amount, a 5% service fee is applied to the excess. For example, if you sell 15,000 RMB worth of products in a month, the first 10,000 RMB is exempt from fees, and the remaining 5,000 RMB is subject to a 5% fee. Store names are also important; personal store names are based on the Xiaohongshu account name and can be changed every seven days. For enterprise stores, changing the store name requires paying the 600 RMB certification fee again. Therefore, it is advisable to choose your store name carefully during the initial setup to avoid additional costs. Starting with a personal store is recommended to minimize initial expenses and gain experience before expanding to multiple stores."

For example, if you are selling lingerie, find the top-ranked competitors and analyze their popular posts. Look at the format they use, whether it's images, videos, or a combination of both. Pay attention to the keywords and phrases in their titles and descriptions. Mimic their successful strategies while adding your unique touch. For instance, if a competitor's post highlights the comfort and fit of a bra, ensure your content also emphasizes these aspects but with your product's unique features. By systematically studying and replicating successful competitor strategies, you can create compelling content that resonates with your target audience."

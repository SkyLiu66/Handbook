        "Content": "Generating traffic on Xiaohongshu involves multiple strategies to attract and retain users. One effective method is to modify your account settings to subtly include your WeChat ID. This can be done by editing your Xiaohongshu account details to hint at your WeChat ID without explicitly stating it, which helps avoid content violations. Another method is to use your profile description to suggest contacting you via email or QQ for business inquiries, although this should be done cautiously to avoid account suspension. Additionally, leveraging Xiaohongshu's 'Moments' feature allows you to post temporary content that can direct users to your main profile or other contact methods. Creating pinned notes and collections can also help in organizing and highlighting important content that directs users to your contact information. By using these methods, you can effectively generate traffic while minimizing the risk of account violations."

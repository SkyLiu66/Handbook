        "Content": "Batch uploading products on Xiaohongshu can significantly streamline your workflow, especially if you have a large inventory. To start, you can use either a computer or a mobile device. For computer users, log in to the Xiaohongshu merchant management backend by searching for 'Xiaohongshu Merchant Management' on your browser. Once logged in, navigate to the 'Product List' section and select the 'One-Click Move' tool. This tool allows you to transfer products from other platforms like Pinduoduo to Xiaohongshu. Copy the product links from your source platform and paste them into the tool. The system will automatically fetch the product details, which you can then review and edit as needed. Make sure to update the product descriptions, prices, and images to ensure they meet Xiaohongshu's guidelines. For mobile users, the process is similar but may be less convenient due to the smaller screen size. Regardless of the device, always double-check the imported data for accuracy and completeness before finalizing the upload. This method saves time and ensures that your product listings are consistent across multiple platforms."

For example, if you are selling bread, search for 'bread' or more specific terms like 'breakfast bread.' Use the filter options to sort by the most liked content within a specific timeframe, such as the past week. This helps you find the most relevant and recent viral content. Analyze the top-performing posts, focusing on their visuals, captions, and the music they use. This analysis will give you insights into what makes content go viral. Additionally, you can search for related hashtags and topics to find more viral content.

Once the product is migrated, fill in all necessary details such as product categories, brands, and logistics options. Ensure that your product supports seven-day returns and specify the shipping timeline. For pricing, a common strategy is to take the original price from platforms like Taobao, multiply it by two, and add an additional amount (e.g., 6 or 10 yuan). This allows room for offering significant discounts through coupons. When setting up your content, focus on high-quality visuals and engaging captions. Use popular hashtags and keywords to increase visibility. By following these steps, you can create compelling and optimized content that attracts more viewers and potential buyers on Xiaohongshu."

You can then recreate similar content for Xiaohongshu, ensuring to make slight modifications to avoid direct copying. Use AI tools to generate new captions and visuals if needed. Similarly, you can take viral content from Xiaohongshu and adapt it for Douyin. This strategy not only saves time but also increases the chances of your content going viral on multiple platforms. By consistently applying this dual-platform strategy, you can maximize your content's reach and engagement."

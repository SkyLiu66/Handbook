Just a very simple action that when shot on an iPhone with these kind of techniques and these kind of principles of using different angles, using different frame rates, using camera movement, we can create a completely interesting and extraordinary scene. So now it's your guys' turn. It's time for you to film one action shot. This can be anything that creatively that you can come up with. It can be making a smoothie. It can be getting ready for school. It can be whatever your heart desires. Hopefully it's something for a video that you'll actually use to upload to one of your channels. But I want it to be shot in two different ways. The first way is just a standard wide shot that you might normally document the situation with. Okay. And the second way is the same exact movement or action. So you can use the same action that you're going to use to document your activity that shot with five to 10 cutaway shots with different shot types and the different types of movement that we covered in the previous lectures. And then I want you to edit it into a five to 10 second montage. Now you can use music that you add or you can use the live audio, the actual audio in the surroundings of what you're shooting as the backing audio track. And share your video link with the standard shot first, and then your updated montage second in the Q and a section, just like this video example right here. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So let's go. What are you waiting for? I want to see those edits guys. Come on. Put your edits together and then upload them to the Q and a section, and I will see you guys in the next lecture.",

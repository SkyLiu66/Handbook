        "Content": "To gain more visibility for your notes, leveraging official traffic sources can be highly beneficial. Official traffic can help boost your initial reach, especially when your account is new. There are two main ways to utilize official traffic: note activities and store activities. For note activities, you can participate in 'Note Inspiration' and 'Community Hot Search Terms.' 'Note Inspiration' can be accessed through the 'Creation Center' in the app, where you can subscribe to various trending topics and receive exposure rewards. 'Community Hot Search Terms' can be used by tagging your notes with popular search terms, increasing the likelihood of your notes being discovered. For store activities, you can participate in various marketing campaigns organized by the platform. These activities often require you to meet certain criteria, such as offering discounts. By participating, your store can gain additional exposure and attract more customers."

The 'Note Inspiration' section in the 'Creation Center' offers various trending topics that you can subscribe to. By doing so, you can receive exposure rewards, such as 200 additional views for new notes. This can significantly boost your note's visibility. Additionally, using 'Community Hot Search Terms' when publishing your notes can help them appear in popular searches. These terms are updated regularly and can be found in the 'Note Rankings' section. By tagging your notes with these terms, you increase the chances of your notes being discovered by a larger audience. This method is particularly useful for new accounts looking to gain initial traction."

        "Content": "Engaging in store activities organized by the platform can help boost your store's visibility and sales. These activities are listed under 'Marketing Activity Registration' and include various campaigns such as seasonal sales and special promotions. To participate, you need to select your products and set promotional prices. It's important to ensure that the discounts offered do not negatively impact your profit margins. For example, if a campaign requires a 30% discount but your profit margin is only 20%, it may not be beneficial to participate. However, if your profit margin is 50% or higher, participating in these activities can be advantageous. The platform will promote your store, and customers are more likely to make purchases during these promotional periods. Adjust your regular prices and discounts accordingly to maximize the benefits of these activities."

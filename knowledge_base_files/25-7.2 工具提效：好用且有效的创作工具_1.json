These tools can be categorized into three main types: trending news aggregators, text conversion tools, and copywriting tools. Trending news aggregators, like 'Today's Hot List,' help gather inspiration and build a topic library by providing a comprehensive overview of daily hot topics across multiple platforms. Text conversion tools, such as 'Chuangzuo Mao' for video-to-text and 'Yuelu' for voice-to-text, streamline the process of converting multimedia content into text, saving time and effort. Lastly, copywriting tools, including AI-based solutions like ChatGPT 4.0, assist in generating high-quality text quickly. By integrating these tools into your workflow, you can significantly boost your productivity and content quality."

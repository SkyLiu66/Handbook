        "Content": "Growing an account on Xiaohongshu involves understanding how the platform's system works in terms of user engagement and content distribution. When you create a new account and start posting content, the system initially doesn't know your audience. It will distribute your content to various user groups to gauge their reactions. If certain groups engage positively with your content, the system will start associating your account with those user profiles. This process is known as 'account growth' or '起号' in Chinese. The key is to consistently produce content that resonates with your target audience, thereby allowing the system to refine your user profile and distribute your content more effectively."

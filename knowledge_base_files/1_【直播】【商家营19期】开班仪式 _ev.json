        "Content": "The training camp consists of a structured course with specific rules. Each day, a sign-in process is initiated five minutes before the class starts. If you miss this window, you won't be able to sign in later. The course spans 16 days, with 15 days dedicated to formal lessons. The course is divided into two parts: theoretical and practical. The theoretical part, lasting 30 to 40 minutes, is pre-recorded by the instructor, while the practical part, also 30 to 40 minutes, involves hands-on activities and assignments. The practical sessions are led by the course instructor, who also provides feedback on assignments. The course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the platform, its features, and practical applications. Each day has a specific theme, and assignments are given to reinforce the day's lessons. It's crucial to complete assignments promptly to keep up with the course pace."

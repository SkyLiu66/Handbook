        "Content": "Xiaohongshu is a platform that emphasizes visuals over text, making the type of image-text notes you create crucial for engagement. The common types include: 1) Real-shot notes, which involve actual photos of people, landscapes, or objects. These require good photography and editing skills. 2) Poster-style notes made using PPT or templates, which are easier to create but may not be suitable for product placements. 3) Semi-real-shot notes, where you use copyright-free images and add text using design tools. 4) Plog (photo blog) notes, which can mix real and semi-real shots, making them versatile for various content types. 5) Screenshot notes, which are straightforward but may limit advertising opportunities. 6) Handwritten notes, either on paper or digitally on devices like iPads, which can convey authenticity but may also limit monetization options. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice should align with your content goals and audience preferences."

Start by structuring your content logically, using formats like lists, step-by-step guides, or problem-solution frameworks. This makes the content easier to read and follow. Use short paragraphs and break up text with images or bullet points to maintain reader interest. Keywords should be strategically placed in the title, headings, and throughout the text to improve searchability. Research popular keywords related to your topic using tools like Xiaohongshu's search suggestions or external keyword research tools. Incorporate these keywords naturally into your content to avoid keyword stuffing, which can negatively impact readability and SEO. Additionally, participate in platform activities and use trending hashtags to increase the chances of your content being discovered.

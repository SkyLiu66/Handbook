        "Content": "Reposting videos on Xiaohongshu can be an effective strategy to maintain and increase your content's visibility. Xiaohongshu operates on a 'no deduplication' mechanism for viral content, meaning that if a video performs well, it can be reposted without any modifications and still attract significant traffic. This is particularly useful for content creators who have previously created successful videos. To maximize the benefits of reposting, monitor the performance metrics of your videos using the Qianfan backend. Focus on metrics such as the number of views, likes, comments, and the 'add to cart' rate. If a video continues to perform well, it can be reposted multiple times until its engagement metrics decline."

        "Content": "Analyzing data is crucial for understanding the performance of your videos on Xiaohongshu. Use the Qianfan backend to access detailed metrics about your content. Key metrics to monitor include the number of views, likes, comments, 'add to cart' rates, and conversion rates. High 'add to cart' rates and conversion rates indicate that the video is effectively driving sales. Additionally, track the performance of your videos over time to identify trends and patterns. For instance, if a video consistently generates high engagement, it can be reposted to maintain its momentum. Conversely, if a video's performance declines, it may be time to create new content or adjust your strategy."

        "Content": "Creating and reposting effective content involves a balance between new and existing videos. While reposting successful videos can maintain engagement, it is also important to create new content regularly. Aim to post a mix of new and reposted videos each day. For example, if you post five videos daily, ensure that at least one or two are new. This approach keeps your content fresh and increases the chances of creating another viral video. When reposting, avoid making any changes to the video to prevent it from being flagged for limited reach. Additionally, use the first three seconds of your video effectively to capture viewers' attention, as this 'golden three seconds' can significantly impact the video's performance."

        "Content": "One of the most common challenges in creating a successful account is clarifying your niche and positioning. Many people want to explore multiple fields but don't know where to start. The key is to identify the unique value you can offer and focus on that. For instance, if you are a writer like Lei Zhuang, you should emphasize your writing skills. Highlighting your strengths will attract an audience willing to pay for your expertise. Similarly, if you are a public servant or a stay-at-home parent, focus on areas where you can provide valuable insights, such as exam preparation for public service or parenting tips. It's crucial to start with a niche that is closely related to monetizable opportunities. If you lack professional skills, consider starting with something universally appealing, like book recommendations. Book recommendation accounts are relatively easy to grow and can attract sponsorships from publishers. The goal is to find a niche that aligns with your strengths and has a clear path to monetization."

        "Content": "On Xiaohongshu, the two main content creation formats are video and image-text. Videos generally have a higher engagement rate because they can convey more information and build a stronger connection with the audience. Videos are also more suitable for establishing a persona and can command higher advertising rates. However, if you prefer not to appear on camera or want to keep a low profile, image-text posts are a viable alternative. Xiaohongshu started as a platform for image-text content, and there is still a significant user base that prefers this format. Image-text posts can be further divided into two types: those that focus primarily on images with minimal text and those that integrate important textual information within the images, supplemented by additional text below. The choice between video and image-text should be based on your industry, personal preferences, and current situation."

        "Content": "When creating content on Xiaohongshu, it's important to structure your posts effectively. For image-text posts, you can either focus on high-quality images with minimal text or integrate important textual information within the images, supplemented by additional text. The latter approach is more engaging as it combines visual appeal with informative content. For videos, you can choose between videos with or without a script. Scripted videos, which include a storyline and characters, are more challenging to produce but tend to have higher engagement rates. Non-scripted videos rely on well-shot footage and smooth transitions to convey the message. Regardless of the format, the key is to provide valuable and engaging content that resonates with your audience. High-quality visuals, clear and concise text, and a well-thought-out structure are essential for creating effective posts."

        "Content": "Effective content creation on Xiaohongshu involves several strategies. First, identify the format that best suits your content and audience, whether it's video or image-text. For image-text posts, ensure that your images are high-quality and visually appealing. Use text to highlight key points and provide additional context. For videos, decide whether to use a script or rely on visual storytelling. Scripted videos with a clear storyline and characters can be more engaging but are also more challenging to produce. Non-scripted videos should focus on high-quality footage and smooth transitions. Additionally, consider using different content structures, such as pain point, process comparison, conflict, reveal, resonance, herd, and contrast modes, to make your content more engaging. Each structure serves a different purpose and can help you connect with your audience in various ways. By experimenting with different formats and structures, you can find the most effective way to engage your audience and achieve your content goals."

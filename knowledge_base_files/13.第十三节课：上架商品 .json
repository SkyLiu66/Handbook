It's crucial to list the products before posting any related notes. Start by finding the product on platforms like Taobao, Pinduoduo, or 1688.

Start by providing a clear and concise product title that includes relevant keywords. Ensure the product images are high-quality and free from any watermarks or brand names. When filling out product attributes, be as detailed as possible. Include information such as sleeve length, style, material, and applicable seasons. For example, if listing a sweater, specify whether it is a pullover or cardigan, its thickness, and the type of fabric used. Set the product specifications accurately, including sizes and colors. Use custom labels for colors and provide size recommendations based on weight or measurements. This helps customers make informed decisions and reduces the likelihood of returns. Additionally, set competitive prices by researching similar products on the platform. Offering slightly lower prices than competitors can make your listings more attractive. Finally, configure the shipping template to ensure accurate delivery options and costs."

Start by configuring your shipping templates. Define which regions are eligible for free shipping and set appropriate shipping costs for other areas. For instance, you might offer free shipping within mainland China but exclude regions like Xinjiang and Tibet. Ensure your shipping settings are clear and accurate to avoid any confusion or disputes. Next, set up your customer service options. This includes automated responses for common inquiries and a manual service option for more complex issues. Use keywords to trigger automatic replies, reducing the workload on your customer service team. Additionally, configure after-sales service options, such as return and exchange policies. Clearly state which products are eligible for returns and under what conditions. Providing excellent customer service and clear shipping policies can enhance the overall shopping experience, build customer trust, and encourage repeat purchases."

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu offers a variety of common and niche markets. Common markets include women's clothing, shoes, accessories, baby products, and household items. These markets are popular due to their broad appeal and high demand. However, they also come with higher competition and return rates. Niche markets, such as aromatherapy products, outdoor gear, and custom items, offer lower competition but require more effort to identify and target. These markets can be highly profitable if you find the right audience. Avoid markets that heavily rely on brand recognition, such as high-end cosmetics or electronics, unless you have the necessary credentials and supply chain. By understanding the dynamics of both common and niche markets, you can make informed decisions about which areas to focus on, balancing demand, competition, and your unique strengths."

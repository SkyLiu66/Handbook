        "Content": "To effectively find and modify content on Xiaohongshu, follow these steps. First, identify high-quality content from your competitors, focusing primarily on videos with text notes as supplementary material. Videos are often mixed and edited, while text notes are frequently posted by manufacturers. It is crucial to avoid directly copying content. Instead, make slight modifications to images and videos to avoid detection by the platform. For instance, you can edit images slightly or mix different video clips. This ensures that your content remains unique and less likely to be flagged for duplication. By carefully selecting and modifying content, you can maintain a steady flow of engaging posts without violating platform rules."

        "Content": "When selecting content to repurpose on Xiaohongshu, focus on recent posts from the last seven to fifteen days. Avoid using content that is too old, as its relevance and engagement may have diminished. Look for posts with high likes and comments, as these indicate popular and engaging content. Be cautious with videos featuring prominent personalities or large IPs, as these can lead to issues with intellectual property rights. Instead, choose content that does not prominently feature individuals or brands. For videos, consider cropping out faces, and for images, use tools to blur or cover identifiable features. This approach ensures that you are using relevant and engaging content while minimizing the risk of being flagged for duplication or intellectual property violations."

        "Content": "To repurpose content for your online store on Xiaohongshu, start by searching for your product category, such as 'phone cases.' Select posts with high engagement from the last week to half a month. Save the images and videos of these products, ensuring they have high likes and comments. For example, a post with 35,000 likes and 1,500 comments indicates high engagement. Compare the product prices on platforms like Pinduoduo or Taobao to find similar items at lower prices. Save the main images and detailed descriptions from these posts. Use these images and descriptions to create your own posts, ensuring they are slightly modified to avoid duplication. Additionally, incorporate positive reviews and buyer showcases from the original posts into your content. This method allows you to leverage popular content to attract customers to your store while maintaining originality and compliance with platform guidelines."

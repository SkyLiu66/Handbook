Many people struggle with creating original content because they only see the surface of viral posts without understanding the underlying logic and patterns.

This involves understanding the pain points addressed, the powerful endorsements used, and the specific techniques employed. By breaking down these elements, you can replicate the success of viral posts while adding your own unique twist.

        "Content": "To create high-quality original content, follow these three steps: First, learn to deconstruct viral posts. This means going beyond simple copying and pasting; instead, analyze the underlying factors that contribute to their success. Identify the 'viral factors' such as pain points, endorsements, and unique presentation styles. Second, innovate based on these viral factors. Use the insights gained from your analysis to create content that is both original and engaging. Finally, ensure that your content is detailed and specific. Use concrete examples, numbers, and real-life scenarios to make your content relatable and trustworthy. By following these steps, you can create content that resonates with your audience and stands out on platforms like Xiaohongshu."

When creating content, it's important to provide detailed and specific information to make your content more engaging and trustworthy. This includes using concrete numbers, real-life examples, and detailed descriptions. For instance, instead of saying 'many people experience this issue,' specify the number of people or provide a relatable scenario. This approach not only makes your content more credible but also helps in capturing the audience's attention. Additionally, detailed content allows for better understanding and retention of information. By focusing on specificity and detail, you can create content that is both informative and engaging, thereby increasing its chances of going viral."

Without these, transactions cannot be processed. Then, navigate to the logistics tools to create shipping and return addresses. For those using multiple suppliers, set the return address to your office and the shipping address to the supplier's location. This setup helps manage returns efficiently. Additionally, create a logistics template with a name of your choice, specifying whether you offer free shipping or charge for certain regions. Adjust the shipping fees for remote areas like Guizhou and Qinghai to cover additional costs. This comprehensive setup ensures smooth payment processing and efficient logistics management."

        "Content": "Creating shipping templates is essential for managing logistics effectively. Start by naming your template and specifying the shipping origin. If you offer free shipping, select 'Seller bears shipping costs.' For remote areas where you don't offer free shipping, enable custom shipping fees and specify the additional charges. For instance, you might add extra fees for regions like Xinjiang and Tibet. This customization ensures that you cover the higher shipping costs associated with these areas. Once the template is set up, it can be applied to your products, streamlining the shipping process. Regularly review and update these templates to reflect any changes in shipping policies or costs, ensuring efficient and cost-effective logistics management."

        "Content": "To effectively post on social media, follow these steps: First, capture a screenshot of the page you want to post. Ensure your device is charged and ready. Open the relevant app, such as Xiaohongshu, and navigate to the backend to select your product. Use trending keywords to find popular items. For example, if you're posting about down jackets, select high-transaction items and use the 'Buy the Same' feature to check product quality. Once you have your product, take a screenshot and search for similar items on platforms like Pinduoduo. Save the main image, title, and details. Next, gather 50-100 pieces of content from sources like Douyin. Save 5-10 scripts for each product type. Use these scripts to create five different videos using editing tools like Jianying. Post these videos at different times throughout the day to test engagement. Use trending keywords in your titles and ensure they are engaging by including numbers, exclamations, and product names. Finally, monitor the performance of your posts and adjust your strategy based on the results."

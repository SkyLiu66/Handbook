        "Content": "Setting the right price for your products can significantly enhance conversion rates and facilitate quick sales. There are two primary methods for pricing: referencing competitors on Xiaohongshu or other platforms like Douyin and Taobao. If a product is already popular on Xiaohongshu, set your price slightly lower than competitors to attract buyers. If the product is not available on Xiaohongshu, use prices from Douyin or Taobao as a reference, and consider setting a slightly higher price if the product is unique. Additionally, use psychological pricing, such as setting prices at 9.99 instead of 10.00, to appeal to consumer behavior. This approach helps in creating a competitive edge and increasing the likelihood of sales."

        "Content": "Maintaining a profit margin of at least 25% is crucial for sustainable business operations. Platforms like Douyin deduct a 5% fee for transactions over 10,000 units, so pricing should account for such deductions. Initially, you can set lower prices to gain traction and increase product visibility, but ensure that the long-term pricing strategy maintains a healthy profit margin. Use promotional tactics like coupons to attract early buyers. For example, if your product costs 5 yuan to produce and you aim to sell it for 9.99 yuan, initially set the price at 15.99 yuan and offer a 6 yuan coupon. This strategy helps in maintaining perceived value while offering discounts to boost early sales."

        "Content": "Coupons are an effective tool to increase conversion rates by offering temporary discounts. Set a higher initial price and provide coupons to create a sense of urgency and value. For instance, if your product's base price is 5 yuan and you want to sell it for 9.99 yuan, set the initial price at 15.99 yuan and offer a 6 yuan coupon. Additionally, using SKU combinations can enhance sales. Offer multiple units or different variations of a product at a discounted rate to encourage bulk purchases. For example, selling two different styles of a product together can appeal to customers looking for variety, thereby increasing the average order value and overall sales."

So this light is simply a 36 inch diffuser, okay, I think I got that at Samy's Camera for like 30 bucks. So this is a really great purchase to add soft lighting and also work secondly as a great sound dampener. Now this is simply just a C-stand that has a 90 degree articulating arm, okay, and I just took a sheet and put that over the arm, super simple, with two clamps at the top. Super easy, super simple way to get a very large change in the sound. The quality of your sound. And you can go more intense into the amount of sound dampening that you do or less. It's really a personal preference up to you of how solid you want your audio to be coming through. But this is an easy way that takes maybe 10 to 15 minutes to set up. And if you're one of those people that's shooting with a permanent setup at your house or wherever you shoot, doing an option like this is an excellent, excellent way to make all of your future videos sound much better.

        "Content": "Nurturing a new account on Xiaohongshu is crucial for its success. Start by not posting immediately after registration. Instead, engage in activities that mimic real user behavior for at least three to six days. This includes browsing popular topics, searching for content related to your niche, and interacting with posts by liking, commenting, and following relevant accounts. This behavior signals to the platform that you are a genuine user, increasing the likelihood of your content being recommended. For accounts focusing on sensitive topics like skincare or weight loss, nurturing is even more critical to avoid being flagged for using sensitive keywords. Regularly engage with the platform to build a credible presence before you start posting your content."

To achieve higher levels, you need to post a certain number of notes, which can be a mix of videos and text. Each note must meet specific interaction criteria, such as likes and saves. Additionally, including popular hashtags recommended by Xiaohongshu can boost your ranking. Higher levels increase your content's chances of being recommended and seen by a larger audience. Regularly posting high-quality content and engaging with the platform's features can help you climb the ranks faster. Understanding and leveraging this mechanism is essential for maximizing your account's reach and influence."

        "Content": "Properly switching between multiple accounts on Xiaohongshu is essential to avoid being flagged as a bot or marketer. If you need to switch accounts frequently, follow these steps: clear your search history and cache, log out of the current account, and close the app. Wait for five to ten minutes before logging into the next account. This process helps prevent the platform from detecting suspicious activity. Additionally, using flight mode during the waiting period can further obscure your switching behavior. Proper account switching ensures that your IP and network are not flagged, maintaining the integrity and reach of all your accounts. This technique is particularly useful for users managing multiple accounts for different purposes, such as personal use and business."

        "Content": "When a note suddenly goes viral without a product link, you can re-edit it to add the link. There are two scenarios to consider. First, if your note has gone viral and you want to add a product link, click on the three dots in the upper right corner and select 'Edit.' Then, click on 'Associate Product,' confirm, and republish. The note will show today's date as the publication date, but all likes, saves, and comments will remain intact. Second, if the note's views have plateaued or dropped, you can re-edit the cover and add small stickers or text. This minor adjustment can help re-engage viewers and make the note appear as newly published while retaining all previous interactions."

Additionally, interacting with comments and encouraging discussions can keep the engagement high. Responding to comments and asking questions can create a sense of community and encourage more interactions.

        "Content": "Including copy in your posts depends on the type of content you are sharing. If you are posting video content, the copy can be minimal or even omitted because the primary information is conveyed through the video and its audio. However, if you are posting images or text-based content, it is essential to include a well-crafted copy. A simple title with a few hashtags is not sufficient. The copy should provide additional context, engage the audience, and encourage interaction. For posts that are meant to drive conversions, such as those promoting a product, the copy becomes even more crucial. If your post is getting good views and likes but not converting, it indicates that the copy is not compelling enough to push the audience to take action. In such cases, revising the copy to include a strong call-to-action can significantly improve conversion rates."

However, for mobile users, the process can be more cumbersome. One effective method is to take a screenshot of the desired text. After capturing the screenshot, use the editing tools to crop the image, leaving only the text. On an iPhone, you can then use the built-in text recognition feature to select and copy the text. This copied text can be pasted into your notes or sent to yourself via a messaging app for further editing. This method is also useful for copying long comments or reviews from platforms like Taobao. By using these tools, you can quickly gather and adapt high-quality copy for your own use."

        "Content": "To ensure your copy is effective, it is important to have a self-check standard. One practical approach is to benchmark against your competitors. Look at how successful accounts in your niche structure their copy. Notice if they use short sentences, bullet points, or specific formatting styles like emojis or special characters. By analyzing a well-performing post from a competitor, you can identify key elements that make their copy engaging. Then, try to emulate these elements in your own writing. Edit and refine your copy multiple times, focusing on clarity, engagement, and a strong call-to-action. This iterative process will help you create compelling copy that resonates with your audience and drives the desired actions."

For example, the beauty and skincare category requires special licenses, making it less accessible for individual sellers. Fashion and accessories demand a wide range of products and have higher return rates, which can be challenging for new sellers. However, categories like jewelry and accessories have lower return rates and higher profit margins, making them more attractive. The food category is growing rapidly, with high repeat purchase rates but requires food safety licenses. Home decor and small appliances are popular for their aesthetic appeal, especially among women who enjoy sharing their purchases online. Understanding these nuances can help sellers navigate the platform more effectively and choose categories that align with their capabilities and market demands."

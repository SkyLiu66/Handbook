        "Content": "Flow restriction on Xiaohongshu can significantly impact your account, especially if you rely on it for advertising revenue or sales. When your account is restricted, the visibility of your posts decreases, leading to fewer likes and interactions. This can deter potential advertisers and reduce your sales. To address flow restriction, first identify the cause. For new accounts, low initial engagement is normal and not necessarily a sign of restriction. Focus on creating high-quality content and gradually increasing your post frequency. For older accounts, a drop in engagement may be due to inactive followers. Consistently posting new content can help regain visibility. If a specific post performs poorly, it might be due to a lack of interest in the topic. Continue posting and monitor the performance of subsequent posts. If the issue persists, consider platform trends and adjust your content accordingly. Regularly check for any violations and address them promptly to avoid further restrictions."

        "Content": "Several factors can lead to flow restriction on Xiaohongshu. Common causes include posting content that violates platform guidelines, such as using copyrighted images, including contact information, or mentioning other platforms like Taobao or JD. To avoid these issues, ensure your content adheres to Xiaohongshu's community guidelines. Avoid using copyrighted material and refrain from including contact details or external platform names. Instead, use indirect references if necessary. Additionally, avoid frequent refreshing of your page to check for updates, as this can trigger the platform's anti-spam measures. Limit the number of posts you delete in a short period, as excessive deletions can flag your account as suspicious. Lastly, steer clear of providing medical, financial, or investment advice unless you have the appropriate credentials. By following these guidelines, you can minimize the risk of flow restriction and maintain a healthy account."

        "Content": "If you encounter flow restriction on Xiaohongshu, there are several steps you can take to resolve the issue. First, identify whether the restriction is due to a specific post or a general decline in engagement. For specific posts, review the content for any potential violations and consider appealing the restriction if you believe it was a mistake. If the appeal is unsuccessful, delete the post to avoid further penalties. For general engagement declines, maintain a consistent posting schedule and focus on high-quality content. Monitor platform trends and adjust your content strategy accordingly. If your account is temporarily restricted from being recommended, refrain from posting new content until the restriction period ends. In severe cases, such as account suspension, appeal the decision and consider creating a new account if the appeal is denied. By taking these steps, you can address flow restrictions and work towards restoring your account's visibility and engagement."

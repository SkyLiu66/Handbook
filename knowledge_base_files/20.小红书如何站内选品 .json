To start, log into the merchant backend of Xiaohongshu and navigate to the 'Notes' section. Here, you can access the community hot search feature, which displays trending product categories. Choose the category that aligns with your business. For more specific targeting, you can select a secondary category. For example, if you are selling jewelry, you might find that necklaces, rings, and bracelets are trending. By focusing on these hot search terms, you can create content that is more likely to attract attention. Additionally, you can filter by 'Most Lacking Notes' to identify high-demand but low-supply topics, increasing your chances of gaining traffic. This strategic approach helps you identify and capitalize on trending products, ensuring your content reaches a wider audience."

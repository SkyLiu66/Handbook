        "Content": "Managing multiple accounts on Xiaohongshu requires careful attention to avoid violations. It is recommended not to use more than three accounts on a single device to prevent frequent switching, which can trigger the platform's security measures. If possible, use an Android device that supports app cloning to manage multiple accounts more efficiently. For iPhone users, avoid frequent account switching. Ideally, use one device per account and avoid connecting to public Wi-Fi networks. This practice helps maintain account integrity and reduces the risk of being flagged for suspicious activity."

        "Content": "To avoid violations on Xiaohongshu, be cautious with your account's nickname and avatar. Do not use nicknames that contain promotional content or advertisements, as this can lead to account restrictions. Instead, focus on creating high-quality content to attract followers. Similarly, avoid using brand logos, trademarks, or contact information in your avatar. This practice can also result in violations. Instead, use a neutral and professional image that represents your brand without directly promoting it. By adhering to these guidelines, you can maintain a compliant and professional presence on the platform."

        "Content": "Proper account maintenance and activity are crucial for avoiding violations on Xiaohongshu. If you have an old account that has been inactive for a while, do not immediately start posting promotional content upon reactivation. Instead, engage in normal user activities such as browsing, liking, and commenting on posts to simulate genuine user behavior. This helps the platform recognize your account as legitimate. Additionally, avoid posting content related to pseudoscience or controversial topics, as these are not well-received on Xiaohongshu. Focus on creating valuable and relevant content that aligns with the platform's community guidelines. By maintaining regular and authentic activity, you can ensure your account remains in good standing."

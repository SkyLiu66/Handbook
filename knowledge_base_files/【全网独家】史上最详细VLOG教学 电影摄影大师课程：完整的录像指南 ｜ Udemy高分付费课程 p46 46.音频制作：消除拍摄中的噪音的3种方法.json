So right now we're in our kind of recording space and if we are quiet and we listen, we can pick up a few things that's happening in the environment. So after you've figured out where you want to film, before you hit the record button, you want to take a survey of things that are causing excess noise that are getting ... excess noise. I don't know what that was. Excess noise that are getting picked up in your scene, just like what we just heard. So we're going to walk through and find out what those potential problems are in most scenarios and we're going to fix those problems. So by first, or one of the first things mainly is window noise. Wind that's coming out of a window. Coming through a window. Cars honking in the background like we just had filming the other lecture. Plenty of cars because we live here in Los Angeles. And there's just a lot of issues. Dogs barking in the distance, whatever. So whether it's obvious or not to you, I definitely want to just mention that closing all your windows before you start recording, very important. The next thing that we hear is air conditioning. This is creating a steady hum in the background. Feels good. Feels really good. But it creates a steady hum in the background. So before we record, AC, boom. The next thing, and this is a much more low key. So the window and the air conditioning unit, very much you got to fix those. Otherwise when you're editing, there's going to be a constant hum in the background. And one of the reasons people click away from videos is if it's echoey, distorted, buzzing, humming in the background. You always want to have clean audio. So the last thing is the hum on the fridge. Now might sound funny, might not. I don't know. But I always, if we listen, you don't want this in your recording. Okay? So I always shut off the fridge and a little hack to that, because sometimes you forget to turn the fridge back on. I set a timer on my phone when I shut off the fridge that in two hours, the timer will go off. You can't do anything about the honking. But the two hours, it's just a little hack. So I set a timer on my phone for two hours. When the timer goes off, it reminds me to turn the fridge back on, because you don't want to leave that off. I've done it many times. But man, these people are honking like on the lecture that I'm doing about sound. What is the joke? So that should give you guys a really good 101 on how to take a normal area and make it sound a lot better. How to use sound dynamics in a room that might be very echoey, always keeping the microphone as close to the subject. It's possible. And really killing the things that can distort or make distracting noises in your recording.",

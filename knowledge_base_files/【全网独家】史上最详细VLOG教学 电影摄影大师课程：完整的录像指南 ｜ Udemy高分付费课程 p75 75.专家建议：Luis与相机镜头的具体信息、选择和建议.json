    "data": " There's a lot of lenses you can recommend people. It's just what it is, is what you can afford. It should always be that way. Like what you can afford, you go for it. But if you want a lens that can do it all, it's this lens. You know what I mean? But if you're already invested in full frame camera gear, like these hybrid shooters, then this won't be an option for you. I mean there is lenses like Tamron that makes that are really good, that I've seen. But Canon and Sony make their own good zoom lenses, like their 24-70 and stuff like that. And those are good just overall, just to get the job done. That's what I would say, that regardless of what kind of Sony or Canon or Luminex, whatever it is, you really want to have at least two main lenses. You want to have something in the 16-35mm range. Right now we're shooting on 16mm. We can see the entire room, Luis and I, all the equipment. And then on this angle, we're shooting on 50mm. This is giving a much more telephoto feel. If you get a lens here and here, you're going to have basically 16mm all the way up to 105mm, which is going to get you through a lot of the scenarios you're shooting with. The way I see it is, there's a lot of rental sites, like ShareGrid. I don't know if your fans know about that, or your students know about that. Do you want to explain that real quick? So I use ShareGrid, and when ShareGrid puts any of these lenses out, or a new thing or something, I like to try them out before I buy, or I buy them used. Mm-hmm. And then hardly buy new. I mean, some people like to buy new because they don't want the damages and the... Something that... One thing you don't know about zooms is that when you buy them used, or even new sometimes, they're slightly off. You won't notice it to the first glance, but when you put it on the computer, you'll notice that slight blur. The focus. Yeah, that just slight blur. And then I was getting that on the 24-70mm for the longest on Canon and Sony. And all my buddies that were hardcore pixel-perfect, hardcore pixel-peepers, they saw that, and then they actually had a good copy of the 24-70mm, and they showed me the side-by-side, and I'm like, damn, that is a big issue. Is that something you can fix by taking it to a shop? You have to take it to wherever they get it fixed, and they will actually realign it for you. I think I have that on one of my lenses. Yeah, so that's the reason why I don't buy... I went with a 24-105mm this time on a Canon, because I saw this on the original Mark III EF version, and I really liked it. I was like, wow, it has stabilization built in. It's the 4.0 with... This is F4, that's the only issue. But you give that for the stabilization. I give that, and it already has great low light, so I don't really go higher than, what, 64,000 or maybe... I mean, I never even go that high. Yeah, those are numbers that we never even touch. Wow, I don't even like going above 3,200 on my Mark II. But that shoot that you saw, those were all... Some of them were about 64 and up. For the fashion? For the fashion, yeah. And then something with the Mandy Moore, what I just did, that was above that. Because there were some shots where we tried to use more ambient light than artificial light, because it was supposed to tell... We use lighting to tell a story. And so we didn't want the lighting to be too flat, so we used the dynamic range of this camera to push and pull. Honestly, it all depends on what you're doing. If you want to be a beauty photographer video guy or girl, you want a macro lens or a zoom lens that can push and pull from here and here or get close eyeballs, because these camera lenses, you cannot get close to the eyeball. You would need a macro, you know what I mean? Especially depending on your client. That's another thing. So it all depends on what you want to do. If you're going to be a wedding or a little family indie filmmaker or whatever... Family indie filmmaker, what is that? Somebody that wants to just shoot stories or film their own personal projects, but wanted to get into advertising, then get a lens that does everything and then rent everything out. You know what I mean? But if you can't rent and you're in a different country and stuff like that, where it's harder to rent because there's not a share grid everywhere, then just try to find and invest on a lens that does it all. You know what I mean? Or get these old vintage lenses too. This is an old eBay... Contact Zeiss. And I got this years ago for like 300 bucks. And dude, this lens still slaps. I can put this on this camera, I can put this on this, I can put this on this, because it's a full frame from 1980 something, somewhere in the 80s. And this glass is so good, it's still good that it's used for cinema. You know what I mean? Or just indie films. And that brings up a good point too as well, that with the lens choice that you're doing, you're gonna see a lot of different 16, 18 to 35s. You're gonna see a lot of different 24 to 70s, 24 to 105s for your camera. And there's gonna be a big price differences. And the price that you're paying is directly linked with the quality of the glass. You know, a $200... There's like the $200 50mm 1.8. Maybe it's $100, the 50mm with the Canon. And then there's the 50mm 1.8. Yeah. And then there's the 50mm 1.4. And then there's the 50mm 1.2. And with each one, it's almost double the price before. So it's like $100, $300, then like $1,200 or something like this. $1,500 maybe. So what you're paying for, yes, there's a slight increase in the maximum aperture, meaning you're gonna be able to get more light. But what you're paying for is the amount of time and energy that went into creating such high quality glass. It creates sharpness and clarity. And that is the look that when you see much more high-end, highly produced videos, you're like, wow, how does this look so damn crisp? It's because they're not shooting on a cheap kit lens that has cheap glass. Cheap kit lens. Exactly. It's like if you have just your eyes and you're seeing everything clearly and you put on opaque sunglasses and now things are a little bit blurry, it takes a lot of work to get all the impurities out of high quality glass to remove those impurities. So it's something to think about is when you go about lens purchases, you wanna, if you're shooting action, if you're shooting travel vlogs and you want scenery and landscapes and something that's more fun and action oriented, wide angle. If you're shooting more beauty blogger, if you're shooting more short film, something more stylized, you want depth of field and the background to be blurry, more telephoto or something that'll get you in the 50 mil, 60 mil, 70 mil. But when you're making those decisions, also keep in mind there's gonna be different price ranges and you wanna pick something that's not as expensive and it's not gonna be the cheap $100, 24 to 105, okay? You're gonna get what you pay for in this area. Yeah. I mean, a lot of the lenses when you buy now are like above 500 or not. Like the thing is you could, like I said, like I bought this 50 mil for the characteristics because the element, the coating that was on here, when it flares, it flares beautifully. Same thing with Canon, they flare beautifully. The Zeiss, I mean the Zeiss, the Sigma, they flare a little differently and more cold, I wanna say. But it has a weird, because I've used plastic lenses, those cheap nifty 50s, the ones that you get for like 100 bucks. Sony, Canon, everyone has one of those cheap pancake lenses. Like they're tiny as hell but they're made out of plastic. And those have plastic, glass. And you can tell right away when you hit the, when you put it against the sun, you'll see the flare and you're like, oh, and it just looks bad on the skin and all that. So that's what you're paying for is that glass that's been refined. To mimic light in such a beautiful way where when it hits the sensor, it does it right for you. It gives you that sense of feeling like, wow, that's a beautiful image, you know what I mean? And that's one thing that I always look for. It's like everyone else is trying to look for that perfect look, that unicorn glass, you know what I mean? But it does not exist. So the way I got to here was, and I still got more glass, I have the 70-200 Canon, I have an old one and I still use that to this day. Because sometimes I got to like back up and zoom in all the way to like from here to here and it just looks good because of the compression of the lens. That's another thing. And I will never possibly ever use like wildlife lenses, like 1600 millimeters or 600. But those lenses are very specialty. I would only rent those. I would never use it. So if you're a person that's a gearhead and just wants to buy everything all at once, that's like the one thing you should never do is buy it as you go. Everything here, I bought it as I go. So I started here, went here and then I went here. But these two right now... And there was a lot of iterations in between. Oh yeah, there was a lot of selling, Sony. So if you see me with my Sony stuff, I used it but I never used it for video. I just like the photos out of it. And it's still a great camera, don't get me wrong. Sony's don't disappoint. If you have a Sony and a lot of people do, it won't disappoint. Just buy the right glass. Yeah. Don't cheap out on your glass either. And buy glass that you know that's gonna... That's one thing I always tell a new buyer is always buy glass that's gonna future-proof your next purchase. So that's why since I already had Canon, Canon was Sigma but it's a Canon mount, I can transfer these to this camera. And that's one thing I tell everybody. If you're gonna buy a Rebel or whatever, one of these, what is it called? Micro Four Thirds lenses, you can't transfer these to any of the bigger cameras. So if you're starting off with a $300, $400 camera or $500 like the A6500, like those little point and shoots but they have really good quality and stuff, you can't transfer that to the next one. And that's one thing that every person that calls me and tells me, hey, what do you think I should get? I mean, I started with a Rebel or I started with a... Like what do you have? Like, oh, I have those old cheap 14 to 13 Canon or whatever. You can't transfer those. Like you have to sell the whole gear. And that's one thing you should never do is like get the glass that you like and then use that and utilize that. So you're, you know what I mean? And then if you get tired of it, then you're, I mean, I'm pretty sure by then you'll be shooting Hollywood films, you know? Because it's all practice, honestly. All this is just learning your style and learning how well you work with it. And then that's how you were able to determine where you want to go in filmmaking or photography, you know? That's a good point. You want to really, when you are making your purchases, you want to be able to have longevity. If you buy some of these cheaper lenses, when you want to upgrade your camera two years later, a year later, you're stuck with these old lenses. They don't really transition. As your creativity and your skillset grows, you want to try and set up that your equipment is going to grow with you. So that's just a really good point equipment-wise.",

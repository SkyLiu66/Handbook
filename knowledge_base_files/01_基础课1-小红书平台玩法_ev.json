        ],
        "Content": "Xiaohongshu offers multiple monetization methods. The first method is through advertisements, which can be either reported (official) or non-reported (soft placements). Official ads require a minimum of 5,000 followers and are managed through the platform, ensuring no restrictions on reach. Non-reported ads are more flexible but carry the risk of limited exposure. The second method is creating and selling courses or columns, which can be live or recorded. This method is particularly effective for knowledge-based content and can generate significant revenue. The third method is live streaming, which is ideal for influencers with a substantial follower base. Live streaming can be used to sell products or courses and often includes a combination of fixed fees and performance-based commissions. The fourth method is private domain traffic, where influencers use Xiaohongshu to attract followers to their private channels for direct sales. Lastly, building a strong personal brand (IP) can open up opportunities for collaborations, book deals, and other high-value engagements. By leveraging these methods, users can effectively monetize their presence on Xiaohongshu."

This could be in the form of tips, tutorials, or personal experiences. It's also important to stay updated with platform trends and continuously improve your content strategy. Lastly, leveraging multiple monetization methods, such as ads, live streaming, and private domain traffic, can diversify income streams and increase profitability.

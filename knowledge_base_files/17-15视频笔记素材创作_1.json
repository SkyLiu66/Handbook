First, identify the video clips you want to use and remove any watermarks using tools like Qingdou or Chuangzuomao. Next, import these clips into a video editing software like Jianying. Begin by adjusting the aspect ratio to fit the platform's requirements, such as 3:4 for Xiaohongshu. Then, mute the original audio and add your own background music to enhance the video's appeal. Use the software's features to cut, rearrange, and merge clips, ensuring smooth transitions between scenes. You can also add text, stickers, and filters to further customize the video. Finally, review the edited video to ensure it flows well and meets your quality standards before exporting it for upload.

        "Content": "Enhancing the originality of your videos is crucial for standing out in a crowded digital space. One effective technique is to use a mix of different video clips and edit them creatively. Start by selecting at least three different clips to increase the variety and originality of your content. Use editing tools to adjust the aspect ratio, mute original audio, and add new background music. Incorporate text overlays, stickers, and filters to give your video a unique look. Additionally, consider using the 'picture-in-picture' feature to add a small clip of yourself or another relevant video within the main video. This not only adds a personal touch but also increases viewer engagement. Regularly updating your editing techniques and experimenting with new features can keep your content fresh and appealing. By focusing on originality, you can create videos that capture attention and drive higher engagement on platforms like Xiaohongshu."

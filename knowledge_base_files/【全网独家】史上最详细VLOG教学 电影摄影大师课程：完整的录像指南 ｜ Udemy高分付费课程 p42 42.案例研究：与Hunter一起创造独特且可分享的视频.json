You have to be aware of the composition I think more than if you have a DSLR obviously because an iPhone has a really high quality camera but the depth of field you just don't have right so being aware of the shots that you're able to use it's almost like here's a good example like if you use a prime lens on a camera it forces you to move your body right it's kind of like it's kind of one of the oldest thing people say is like if you want to get better photography or videography like use a prime lens so you don't zoom in right I feel like it's kind of that to a higher level it's like it forces you to focus on things that you could get away with with a higher level piece of equipment like composition hand movement right like I'm using a very light iPhone so any little motion in my hand is going to catch. So being really hyper aware of how to do hand held cameras. Camera movements is a really good thing to learn when you're using an iPhone and I would say those two things just being able to understand composition a little bit better forces you to kind of only use what you have and then secondarily is like if you're going to use hand movements or hand held movements then it's a great way to kind of test your skills. Right and so with this did you know you wanted to do it sound driven with a montage or did you entertain the idea of doing maybe fully. Yeah. A montage driven by the live sound in the video. Good question. No I had the song in mind for this specific clip so that was kind of that was actually the foundation of this video and what kind of sparked the thought because it kind of had this like kind of chill morning vibes energy to it so it kind of was the foundation of why I chose the sequence this story that's what kind of built off of that. Perfect and so have you been able to kind of use this project in any way out of the way outside has it brought in any kind of other gigs or anything like that any kind of you know other things. Yeah as a filmmaker it's definitely it's just it's not necessarily directly brought in a gig sound like somebody's like saw it and was like hey I need an iPhone video made for my company right. I would say indirectly 100 percent in the sense that all for one like I said from an engagement perspective not that likes and views matter. But they do when it comes to social media development. This specific video got the most shares and it also was shared on platforms that host videography and filmmaking content like learn filmmaking filmmaker like all of those kind of like theme accounts on social media like Instagram. So that to my mind was like oh this is a shareable piece of content. So creating these types of content isn't necessarily a you know. You know. Full depth personally driven creative expression type of project but it's a project to get my account found as a project to teach. I guess that I have a course. So this shows people like oh I'm a teacher I'm not just creating you know photos for myself which nothing wrong with that at all. Of course that's great. So it's established me as a teacher and also to like I said a lot of my students are well specifically focused on creating YouTube channels. And a lot of them are intimidated by the filmmaking process. So this shows them like oh you don't need to have you know a three thousand dollar USR. You can start with what's in your pocket if you're willing to take the time to learn how to use the tool. And that's really what's come from this. What do you think it is you're saying that this was one of your better more engagement more shares more audience interaction with your probably lowest expensive piece of equipment which is kind of. A weird contrast or it seems like it opposes you know what I'm saying. So what is that sauce. What is that thing that other people can really hear and apply into equipment. Yes it's important. But what is it about this video that created that engagement that other people are wanting in their videos. I can get mad with that. A few thoughts. One it's different. You know it immediately is different. Most people don't see people making cinematic B roll sequences with an iPhone. It's immediately right there too. It's a format that I recognized as something that's getting attention. I follow a lot of filmmaking accounts and I was like oh this this format of showing what you create whether it's like the timeline on the bottom and the B roll sequence on the top or the actual filmmaking kind of POV style. I recognize oh these pieces of content are getting shared these pieces of content are getting a lot of engagement. And I said oh I'm going to go start creating this. And I think the key to that is just being observant. And that always develops and change. People use social media differently and it always is evolving and changing based on like Instagram Reels just came out like there's the it's basically obviously like mimicking TikTok. I thought that was very interesting. That's a side tangent. But like people use Instagram in a very specific way. People use TikTok in a very specific way. People use YouTube in a very specific way. But now that people got used to how to use TikTok and all of a sudden Instagram Reels came out now I see the TikTok dances on Instagram Reels. It's become like a meme of its own. Right. And I think that's because. It's how people are used to using a platform and for the filmmaking photography community the show people the process then show them the result was very viral on TikTok. And I was like oh that's going to start carrying over to Instagram. So that's that was my mindset around why I did this. It's and it's a vibe. There's a feeling there's a it's storytelling in the sense of you're showing someone's experience and you're you're giving it in a way that is a aesthetically pleasing. And. And I think that's what I want to speak to that is that it's obviously all these techniques apply to any piece of equipment. But when it comes to storytelling and you know using video to tell that story what have you kind of learned over the years with that process. Good question. It's just like a. There's a finesse to a good video versus a great video versus a holy crap video right. And it's all these little subtle things that come together. I don't claim to be the best. Technically. I'm not a technical filmmaker. I know there's so many people who are amazing at both the shooting and editing process right. But it's like you can just like bring or be willing to teach yourself all those little elements and work on them and they all come together. I think that's what makes something stand out. So in my mind in this specific project in this video it's handheld. So can you shoot handheld video. Well do you know how to use your body and not just your hands. Do you know how to what types of shots can you shoot versus what you can. Right. There's certain shots with the gimbal if I was like chasing her and she was running. I was probably unless you're trying to get like a shaky kind of like you know action scene but understanding how to do that is one thing. Color correction. Right. So understanding how to color correct and grade a shot. Once again something that's not typical for an iPhone video but if you can bring all of those little elements together and understanding how to edit a sequence together that feels natural and not forced or awkward. Yeah. I think all of those elements coming together so like a little bit of editing technique shooting technique lunch saying how to color grade understanding how to cut a sequence to a beat and not just like randomly putting shots together to some song that doesn't really fit. I think those are all the elements that really come together and that's I imagine like something that's once again I'm a structured person so you can break that down and kind of like put that onto a spreadsheet and it's something that is just unspoken and kind of like you have to have a finesse in us. An awareness that's unspoken and I think being able to have both of those elements is really what brings that together. Right. So what's the one thing if you were to do this project now that you've done this one and you let's say you wanted to do I want to do another 30 second just what's the one thing that you would upgrade or change to really make it even one step better. It's a good question. I would bring in some element of humor or pop culture relevancy. Like what is something because that's really the things that people connect with on the Internet whether it's on YouTube especially in this short format right is something that people relate to. Is it like and it can be expressed in so many different ways whether it is like getting in a fight with your girlfriend and kind of like creating a little sequence of that obviously audio that brings something in like actual dialogue that's that's immediately something I would probably bring in is like how could I create like a little dialogue sequence that shows something that's relatable humorous. Yeah. And connects with people in that way. I think that's what I would do because that's really I think what people relate to especially in short format content like Instagram and TikTok which is obviously this is meant for that platform. And you see a lot of people who are in the kind of social media creator world to do that type of stuff and on the most like kind of like low low quality way they're not like you know color grading their footage and doing B roll sequences. But they're doing something that connects with people that's relatable whether it's like some goofy you know sequence of a girlfriend and a boyfriend ghosting each other while they're texting or something stupid like that and it's kind of like I think to a filmmaker or creative like oh that's stupid but like so people care about. So how can you blend those two things together the pop culture elements and the relatability element with storytelling filmmaking and those two things together. I think that's the stuff that stands out. Exactly. Yeah. And I think that's the community thought or the stuff that so many people relate to express that in a video. That's something that I'm really working on changing you know yeah the type of content that I create for social media platforms because what I think is good is like high produced what the majority of people is like entertainment humor something that oh yeah I know that I get that. So that's something that yeah I'm working on that balance as well. So to kind of sum it up and wrap it up here. What's kind of something you want to leave the students with these cinematographers upcoming video creators. You know what's a little piece of advice you know that you've learned over the years you want to leave them with. I would say this. I think it's easy to especially as a filmmaker and a creative to focus on what other people do and be overwhelmed by that. And I think it's hard to sometimes when you get in your own head of like creating your own style and the way that you create content. I think though it's a balance of like kind of observing and learning from others while still at the same time creating your own style. So don't be so focused and headstrong about like I want to do it the way that I want to do it. Nor on the flip side don't be so focused on like I'm going to do exactly what Sam Colder do it and it's going to work and I'm going to be a travel influencer and like I was that person too I literally like turned down jobs so I could go fly to Bali and like I'm going to go film waterfalls. And that was the most amazing experience I've ever had. But that doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to create the same result from that. Kind of my point in saying that is that focus on your style focus what is authentic to you and observe what people do because they're really the blend of the two is really I think how you're going to create success in that. I'm very much like coming from a background of digital marketing so like I think more from a strategist more so than a creative. But if you can bring that to the table. You can bring both those elements together both the creative mindset and the strategic observant mindset. I think that's really what will stand out and kind of allow you to one not only be creatively fulfilled but also understand like what type of content are people hiring for. You know where if I'm looking to become a full time filmmaker and be paid for this you know career and skill what types of jobs and things are people going to hire me for versus the creative side of things. And I think both of those things need to kind of be understood and brought together. Yeah I love that man it's all about remixing and talk a lot about that taking yourself you know other people's ideas and yeah remixing and building something new but building on top of what's worked before you know so well perfect man thank you for coming on today and expounding on you know all the stuff that you learned on making this project and of course going to link to all your sites so that all the students can. You know. Check out your work and looking forward to seeing the next iPhone project the next smartphone video. Glad to chat and thanks.",

        "Content": "Selecting the right keywords is a critical step in Xiaohongshu SEO. Keywords should be relevant to your content and what your target audience is searching for. There are several types of keywords to consider: product-related keywords (e.g., 'skincare', 'fashion'), functional keywords (e.g., 'moisturizing', 'anti-aging'), and situational keywords (e.g., 'summer skincare', 'winter fashion'). Tools like Xiaohongshu's own keyword planner or third-party tools can help identify high-traffic keywords. It's also beneficial to look at competitors' posts to see which keywords they are using successfully. Once you have a list of potential keywords, incorporate them naturally into your post titles, descriptions, and tags. Avoid keyword stuffing, as it can make your content less readable and may be penalized by the platform. Effective keyword selection can help your posts appear in more search results, increasing visibility and engagement."

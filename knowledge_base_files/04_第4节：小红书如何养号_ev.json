            "Content": "Hello everyone, I am Teacher Mumu. In this lesson, I will explain how to nurture your account. It's crucial to nurture your account before posting notes. You need to establish your account's tags and model so that Xiaohongshu understands your interests and intentions. First, choose a product category, such as jewelry or phone cases. Search for your chosen product on Xiaohongshu and interact with related posts by liking, saving, or commenting on them. Ensure your interactions appear natural and not robotic. Spend time watching videos fully before interacting. Avoid searching for unrelated content like health or wellness. Continue this process for three days to establish your account's identity."

            "Content": "While nurturing your account, also focus on selecting products to post. For example, if you choose phone cases, evaluate the product's popularity by checking the posting date and engagement metrics like likes and comments. Look for posts within the last week for popular categories and within the last month for less popular ones. Avoid posts with too many likes as they may have already saturated the market. Check the comments for purchase intent and ensure the product has a reliable supply source. Select two to three products to post."

            "Content": "After selecting products, find two to three benchmark accounts that align with your interests and product category. These accounts should have a similar style, content, and price range to what you aim to achieve. Avoid accounts with a large following as they may not be comparable to your current level. Look for accounts with a few thousand followers and recent activity within the last six months. Analyze their posts, titles, and engagement to understand what works well in your niche. This will help you create effective content and grow your account."

        "Content": "Using data tools like '考古家' (Kao Gu Jia) is essential for effective product selection, especially when dealing with platforms like Douyin (TikTok). The core logic involves filtering recent popular products. The steps include selecting your niche, filtering for products with high sales and positive reviews over the last 7 to 30 days, and matching products to your target audience. For instance, if you are in the fashion niche, you would filter for high-selling items with over 90% positive reviews. Then, you would analyze the audience demographics to ensure they align with your target market. This process helps in identifying products that are not only popular but also relevant to your audience, increasing the likelihood of successful sales. By leveraging these data tools, you can make informed decisions and stay ahead of market trends."

The process involves searching for popular videos related to your niche and analyzing their performance metrics such as likes, shares, and comments. For example, you can look at the 'Video Hot Push List' to identify trending videos. Once you find relevant videos, you can save them and use them as inspiration for your content. This includes observing how the videos are shot, the type of content that resonates with the audience, and the overall presentation style. Additionally, you can use these videos to create mixed edits, combining multiple clips to produce a new, engaging video. This method not only saves time but also ensures that your content is aligned with current trends, thereby increasing its potential reach and engagement."

Tools like '考古家' provide detailed insights into user profiles, including age groups, gender distribution, and geographic locations. By understanding these demographics, you can tailor your marketing strategies to better meet the needs and preferences of your audience. For example, if your target audience is primarily young women aged 24-30 in urban areas, you would focus on trendy, fashionable items that appeal to this group. This targeted approach increases the effectiveness of your marketing efforts and improves the chances of converting viewers into customers."

Now, with video on your laptop, it's really similar to your phone, and in general, where you want to have things as close to eye level as possible. This is honestly a little bit low for my liking. It should probably be something like that. You can feel that this feels a lot more presentable than this. This is a lot more casual. You're not really setting things up. If this is you and your family, that's totally fine. I want to get this a little bit higher, so I'm just going to grab a prop in the house that I can easily use. Now, this is not a step that all people should need to take, but this is just a little extra step that, whether you're doing this professionally or with friends and family, this will give you... a slightly better looking image on your laptop. So, the next thing that I want to do is, because I already have a decent main lighting source, I want to get the exposure down behind me, because this is all blown out, and the image is very grainy in the darks and around the frame. Something you really have to keep in mind with laptop videos when you're streaming or doing... these zoom calls is that you don't have the type of quality to work with that you have on a DSLR or more professional camera, or even the iPhone quality is going to do so much more. So, you really have to take a few extra steps to make this look good, which the next step is going to be getting the exposure behind me down. So, let's see what that looks like. Okay. And you can see that it's a lot cleaner of an image. So, if you go to the before, and the after. So, you can see pretty well lit. Of course, it's a little bit grainy. It's not much we can do about that. It comes down to the quality of the camera on our laptop, which the quality is not that good most of the time. One last thing that I wanted to actually add that we have available in this kind of situation is adding practical lights in the background. Like you probably already know by now in this course, this is one of my favorite things. So, this is an oak here. This is a little bit dull, but we're going to really make things look a lot more stylized by adding on these practical string lights in the background. Let's see what that looks like. I love these lights. Voila, as you can see, a lot better looking of an image. Now, something to keep in mind before I wrap up this lecture is the video or the camera inside the laptop is always recording on auto, so it's kind of getting confused by these lights in the back. I'm going to try to get the camera in the background and I can see the exposure kind of changing. So, stylistically, it looks really nice, but it's also, yeah, it's there's a lot of the ISO kind of issues and some digital noise going on and whatnot, but this is just a little extra step for your laptop videos.",

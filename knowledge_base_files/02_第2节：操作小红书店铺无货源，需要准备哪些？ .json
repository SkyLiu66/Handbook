        "Content": "Setting up a Xiaohongshu store without inventory involves several steps. First, you need to open a store on Xiaohongshu and publish posts that include product links, known as 'Little Yellow Car' links, to promote products. The no-inventory model means you place orders through Alibaba and have them shipped directly to customers. This method leverages the high traffic and active user base of Xiaohongshu, which has over 200 million active users, predominantly women from first and second-tier cities. The platform's competitive advantage lies in its high-quality user base and relatively low competition, making it a sustainable option for long-term business. Additionally, users can be directed to private domains for secondary monetization."

        "Content": "Before launching a Xiaohongshu store, several preparations are necessary. You need a smartphone (either iPhone 7 or above, or a compatible Android phone) and a computer for managing orders and inventory. It's advisable to have 3-5 Xiaohongshu accounts, each linked to a unique phone number. For sourcing products, an Alibaba account is essential. Additionally, having a business license allows you to open multiple stores; a personal ID allows only one store, while a business license can open up to three. For creating content, tools like Meitu Xiuxiu for photo editing and Jianying for video editing are recommended. These tools help in producing high-quality visuals that attract more engagement."

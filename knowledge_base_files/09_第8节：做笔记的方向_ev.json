Posting notes should not be as casual as posting on a personal social media feed; the content must be focused on a specific niche. Choose a field you are most skilled at and interested in, so you have enough content to sustain your account. You can imitate other influencers or bloggers, but make sure to capture the essence, not just the surface."

The profile should use one sentence to introduce yourself, clearly stating your content direction so users immediately understand what you do. The background image should be simple and clear, not too flashy, and can be designed based on your content."

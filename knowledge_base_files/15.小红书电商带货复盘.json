        "Content": "The first stage in Xiaohongshu product selection is identifying profitable products. Focus on products that are consistently making money on Xiaohongshu rather than those that are successful on other platforms like Taobao or Douyin. This ensures that the products are well-suited to the Xiaohongshu audience. For example, a product like a selfie stick might appear profitable with high sales, but if daily sales are low, it indicates that the product's popularity has waned. Instead, look for products with consistent daily sales and high profit margins. Additionally, avoid products that have high engagement but low sales, as user interest does not always translate to purchases. By focusing on products that are proven to sell well on Xiaohongshu, you can minimize risks and increase your chances of success."

        "Content": "For new Xiaohongshu accounts, an effective content strategy is crucial for gaining traction. Initially, avoid posting direct advertisements. Instead, focus on creating 'traffic-type' posts that encourage user interaction. These can include guides, tutorials, and personal stories that resonate with your audience. Such posts are more likely to be shared, liked, and commented on, helping to build your account's visibility and engagement. Aim to post a mix of 20% traffic-type content and 80% promotional content. This balance ensures that while you are building engagement, you are also promoting your products. Increase your posting frequency to at least one post per day to maximize exposure. Once you have a post that gains significant traction, it will help establish your account's niche and attract more targeted followers. Over time, as your account gains more followers and engagement, you can gradually increase the proportion of promotional content."

        "Content": "Participating in Xiaohongshu's platform activities is an effective way to increase your account's exposure. The platform frequently hosts events and challenges that offer additional visibility to participating accounts. By joining these activities, you can benefit from the platform's promotional efforts, which can significantly boost your posts' reach. For instance, Xiaohongshu often provides a tiered exposure system where initial participation grants a small exposure boost, and continued engagement can lead to larger boosts. Additionally, ensure that your products are listed under multiple relevant categories to increase the chances of being featured in various events. Regularly check the platform's event calendar and participate in as many relevant activities as possible. This proactive approach not only increases your exposure but also helps you stay engaged with the platform's community, leading to more organic growth and higher engagement rates."

        "Content": "User interest tags are crucial for content recommendation on platforms like Xiaohongshu. When users register, they are asked about their interests, such as beauty, skincare, or sports. Based on these selections, the platform recommends relevant content. Additionally, the system continuously updates these tags based on user behavior, such as searches, likes, comments, and shares. For example, if a user frequently searches for skincare products, the platform will tag them as interested in skincare and recommend related content. This tagging system ensures that users receive personalized content that matches their interests. For content creators, understanding this tagging mechanism is essential. By producing content that aligns with popular interest tags, creators can increase their visibility and engagement. It's also important to note that these tags are dynamic and can change based on evolving user behavior, so continuous content optimization is necessary."

For instance, students might search for 'dorm essentials,' while their parents might not. By creating content that matches these search preferences, you can attract a highly relevant audience. To identify these preferences, use Xiaohongshu's search suggestions and related keywords. For example, if you are in the beauty niche, common search queries might include 'skin allergy remedies' or 'sunburn treatment.' Compile these keywords into an Excel sheet and use them to guide your content creation. This approach ensures that your content is discoverable by users actively searching for related topics. Additionally, embedding these keywords naturally within your content can improve its search ranking, making it more likely to be seen by your target audience."

This technique, known as keyword embedding, increases the chances of your content appearing in various search results. Moreover, regularly updating your content with new keywords can keep it relevant and maintain its search ranking.

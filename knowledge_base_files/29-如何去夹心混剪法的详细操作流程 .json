        "Content": "The first step in creating a mixed video using the sandwich method is to find and prepare your materials. You can source these materials from platforms like Pinduoduo or Douyin. Once you have your materials, open your video editing software, such as Jianying, and start a new project. Import your photos or videos into the project. Adjust the aspect ratio to 3:4 if you are working with images. This ensures that your content fits the platform's requirements. Next, add music that matches the style of your product. For example, if your product has a sweet and cool vibe, choose music that complements this theme. Use the auto-beat feature to synchronize your images or videos with the music, ensuring that each visual element aligns with the beat for a more engaging experience. This preparation phase is crucial as it sets the foundation for the rest of your video creation process."

        "Content": "Enhancing the visual and audio elements of your video is essential for creating engaging content. Start by adding transitions and effects to your images or videos. Use the 'zoom in' effect to make your visuals more dynamic. Adjust the brightness and contrast to ensure that the visuals are clear and appealing. Be cautious not to overdo it, as this can lead to discrepancies between the actual product and its representation, potentially causing returns. Adding music is another critical step. Choose a track that matches the mood of your content and use the auto-beat feature to synchronize the visuals with the music. This creates a rhythm that makes the video more enjoyable to watch. Additionally, you can add sound effects and voiceovers to highlight key features or points. By carefully enhancing both visual and audio elements, you can create a more immersive and engaging video experience for your audience."

        "Content": "The sandwich method involves combining original content with sourced materials to create a unique video. Start by filming a short clip using your camera. This clip should be around ten seconds long and can feature anything, such as your surroundings or a family member. The purpose of this clip is to establish originality. Import this clip into your video editing software and adjust the volume to zero. Next, import your sourced materials and place them between the original clips. Adjust the aspect ratio to match the original content. Use the 'picture-in-picture' feature to overlay the sourced materials onto the original clip. Ensure that the transitions between the original and sourced materials are smooth. Finally, export the video in 1080p resolution with a frame rate of 30 fps. This method ensures that your video is unique and complies with platform guidelines, making it more likely to be approved and reach a wider audience."

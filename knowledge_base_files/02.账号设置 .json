        "Content": "When setting up a Xiaohongshu account, it's essential to create a professional and trustworthy profile. Start by choosing a nickname that resonates with your target audience, such as 'Senior' for males or 'Senior Sister' for females. This helps build a connection with your followers. Your profile should include a detailed and professional-sounding bio, even if some details are exaggerated for effect. Avoid including contact information in your bio, especially if your account is new, as this can lead to restrictions or bans. Instead, focus on creating a profile that looks credible and engaging. Mimic successful accounts in your niche to understand what works. If you have an old account, hide previous posts to start fresh. For new accounts, it's recommended to 'nurture' the account for 3 to 7 days to build up its weight on the platform."

Look at their profile setups, the type of content they post, and how they engage with their audience. Pay attention to their bios, nicknames, and the overall aesthetic of their profiles. Mimicking these elements can help you create a more appealing and trustworthy profile. Additionally, observe how they structure their posts, the hashtags they use, and their interaction patterns. This can provide valuable insights into effective content strategies. If you struggle to find benchmark accounts, seek help from someone experienced in your niche. Remember, the goal is to learn from these accounts and adapt their successful strategies to your own profile."

        "Content": "Managing multiple accounts on Xiaohongshu can increase your chances of success. Start by creating at least two accounts, preferably three if you have multiple devices. This approach allows you to test different strategies and see which account gains traction. For new accounts, it's crucial to 'nurture' them for 3 to 7 days. This involves regular activity to build up the account's weight on the platform. Follow a detailed nurturing guide to ensure you're doing it correctly. Avoid linking contact information in your bio until your account has a significant following, as new accounts are more likely to be restricted or banned for this. Focus on creating high-quality content and engaging with your audience. Once you identify which account is performing well, concentrate your efforts on that account to maximize its potential."

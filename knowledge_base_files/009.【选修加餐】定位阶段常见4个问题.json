            "Content": "Common issues during the positioning phase often revolve around whether an account appears too chaotic due to posting diverse content. Accounts can be categorized into theme-based and persona-based. A theme-based account is highly vertical, focusing on a specific niche, such as a food blogger who only shares air fryer recipes. This helps in quickly gaining followers interested in that niche. On the other hand, persona-based accounts revolve around the individual, allowing for a broader range of content. For example, an influencer might post about skincare, study tips, and fitness, leveraging their personal brand to attract followers."

For example, a food blogger focusing solely on air fryer recipes will attract followers interested in that specific topic, leading to higher conversion rates. Vertical content helps in building a precise model, making monetization easier. Scattered content with imprecise tags makes it difficult to monetize effectively."

For instance, a fashion influencer might use tags related to fashion and beauty. Adding relevant topics and tags to your posts ensures that the system pushes your content to the right audience, based on data feedback like likes, saves, and comments."

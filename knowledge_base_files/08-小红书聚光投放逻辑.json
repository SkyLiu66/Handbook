        "Content": "To set up and verify a Xiaohongshu account, follow these steps. First, create an account and apply for a Blue V verification. If you have a health permit, you can complete the verification process yourself. If not, third-party services typically charge around 800 RMB for this. The initial recharge for the 'Juguang' promotion tool is 2000 RMB, and subsequent recharges can be any amount. To be eligible for the whitelist, your account must have spent at least 1000 RMB in the past 30 days. This allows you to include contact information in your posts. If you don't meet this requirement, your contact details will not be visible to others. Additionally, be aware that Xiaohongshu may restrict your account if you violate their guidelines, such as sending too many private messages. The first violation results in a 7-day ban, and the second violation results in a 14-day ban and reduced visibility."

        "Content": "Creating effective content on Xiaohongshu involves understanding the platform's preferences and audience. Xiaohongshu favors 'soft' advertisements over 'hard' ones. For example, content that subtly integrates products into lifestyle posts tends to perform better than overt advertisements. Women’s content, such as beauty tips, fashion, and lifestyle, should focus on soft advertising. Men’s content can include transformation stories or design-focused posts. Before launching ads, ensure your profile is well-prepared with at least 20-30 posts to create a solid foundation. Customize your profile with a unique signature and use high-quality images and videos. Utilize Xiaohongshu's professional account features, such as auto-reply, which becomes available once your account meets the spending threshold. Testing different content types and optimizing based on performance is crucial. Start with a batch of 10-20 posts, analyze their performance, and refine your strategy by focusing on the top-performing content."

        "Content": "Optimizing ad campaigns on Xiaohongshu requires a systematic approach. Begin by testing multiple ads simultaneously. For instance, start with 10-20 ads and run them for a week. After the initial test, retain the top-performing ads and discard the underperforming ones. Continue this process until you narrow down to the best 2-3 ads. It's essential to monitor the budget and adjust bids accordingly. Aim to spend your budget within 8 hours to ensure your ads are competitive. If your budget is exhausted too quickly, reduce your bid. Conversely, if it takes too long to spend, increase your bid. Analyze the data to identify peak engagement times and allocate your budget to these periods. For example, if your data shows that most conversions happen between 4 PM and 10 PM, focus your ad spend during these hours. Regularly review and optimize your ad copy and visuals based on performance metrics to maintain high engagement and conversion rates."

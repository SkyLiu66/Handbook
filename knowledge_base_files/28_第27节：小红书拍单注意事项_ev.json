        "Content": "When fulfilling orders on Pinduoduo, it's crucial to ensure seamless delivery to avoid customer dissatisfaction and returns. Firstly, Pinduoduo has canceled SMS notifications for orders, which previously alerted customers and could lead to increased returns. This change is beneficial for those operating without inventory. Secondly, avoid including any promotional cards or feedback request cards in the packaging, as these often contain Pinduoduo branding. If customers receive such items, they may realize the product is from Pinduoduo and request a refund or leave negative feedback. Always communicate with the supplier to ensure 'no-trace' shipping, meaning no Pinduoduo branding or promotional materials are included. If a supplier cannot guarantee this, find another who can. This practice helps maintain a high order completion rate and positive reviews, which are essential for the growth and reputation of your store."

        "Content": "Effective customer service management is vital for maintaining customer satisfaction and ensuring repeat business. It is recommended to use a dedicated customer service team rather than relying on Pinduoduo's official customer service. This allows for more personalized and timely responses to customer inquiries. Ensure that your response rate is above 80%, as this significantly impacts customer satisfaction and your store's reputation. Download the Pinduoduo Merchant App to manage customer interactions efficiently. This app provides a comprehensive backend where you can monitor orders, handle after-sales service, and manage financial transactions. Set up notifications on your phone to alert you of new messages, ensuring you never miss an important customer inquiry. By managing customer service effectively, you can build trust and loyalty among your customers."

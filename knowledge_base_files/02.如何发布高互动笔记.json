A healthy account should have a basic view count of at least 50, with 200 being ideal. For example, you can create a simple post with a white background and some text asking for comments on a specific topic, such as 'Looking for shoes that can be worn outside.' High interaction in the comments section indicates that your account is active and engaging. This method helps you gauge the baseline activity of your account and ensures that it is ready for regular use."

To use these mini-programs, first, copy the link of the content you want to download. Open WeChat and search for a mini-program like 'Good Stuff.' Paste the link into the mini-program and wait for it to parse the content. Once the parsing is complete, you can save the video, cover image, and title directly to your device. Some mini-programs may require you to watch a short advertisement before downloading, but this is a small trade-off for the convenience they offer. By using WeChat mini-programs, you can streamline your content management process, making it easier to gather and organize materials for your projects."

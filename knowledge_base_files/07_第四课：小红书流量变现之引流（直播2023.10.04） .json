        "Content": "Using GPT to write Xiaohongshu notes can be effective for video notes but is less recommended for text and image notes. Video notes primarily rely on the quality of the video content, making the text less critical. Therefore, GPT can be used to generate the accompanying text for video notes. However, for text and image notes, GPT-generated content often lacks the personal touch and authenticity that resonate with the audience. It is advisable to manually write these notes to ensure they are engaging and relatable. Manual writing allows for customization and the inclusion of personal experiences, which can significantly enhance the note's appeal and effectiveness."

        "Content": "When publishing notes, it is crucial to select topics that are relevant to your content. Start by accessing the 'Creation Center' through the three-bar menu in the top-right corner. Choose 'Note Inspiration' and select a category related to your content, such as fashion for clothing-related videos. Publish your note by following the prompts and uploading your video. Experiment with different topics for each note to see which ones generate the most traffic. For example, if a note published under 'Fashion' performs well, use that category again. Ensure the topics you choose are directly related to your content to attract meaningful traffic. Avoid selecting unrelated topics, as this will not yield beneficial results. Consistently monitor the performance of your notes and adjust your topic selection accordingly."

        "Content": "Using hashtags effectively can significantly increase the visibility of your notes. After uploading your video and selecting a relevant topic, you will need to choose appropriate hashtags. Use the search function to find hashtags related to your content, such as 'fashion' or 'outfit.' Prioritize hashtags with high view counts, as these are more likely to attract traffic. Do not rely solely on the order of hashtags in the search results; instead, focus on their view counts. Select at least 5 to 10 hashtags for each note. If the platform automatically adds a hashtag based on your topic, ensure you add at least five more to meet the minimum requirement. This strategy helps in maximizing the reach and engagement of your notes."

        "Content": "Monitoring and adjusting the performance of your notes is essential for continuous improvement. After publishing a note, track its performance by observing metrics such as views, likes, and comments. Compare the performance of notes published under different topics to identify which ones generate the most traffic. If a particular topic consistently performs well, continue using it for future notes. Conversely, if a topic does not yield good results, try different ones. Additionally, analyze the effectiveness of the hashtags you use. If certain hashtags attract more views, prioritize them in future notes. Regularly updating your strategy based on performance data ensures that your notes remain relevant and engaging to your audience."

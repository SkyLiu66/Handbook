        "Content": "Opening a Xiaohongshu store is straightforward and can be done with zero cost and zero followers. The process involves navigating to the 'Creation Center' and selecting 'Open Store.' You can choose between different types of stores: personal, individual business, or enterprise. For beginners, a personal store is recommended as it requires only an ID card and a refundable deposit of 1000 RMB. The choice of product categories is crucial; it's advisable to select specific subcategories to avoid higher deposit fees. Initially, you can choose up to five categories, but exceeding this limit can significantly increase the deposit amount. Once the store is set up, you can start listing products and publishing commercial posts. The platform provides initial traffic support for new stores, making it easier to gain visibility and attract customers."

        "Content": "Choosing the right product categories is essential when setting up your Xiaohongshu store. The platform offers a wide range of categories, from fashion to home goods. It's important to select specific subcategories to ensure better targeting and avoid higher deposit fees. For instance, if you want to sell women's clothing, you can choose subcategories like tops, dresses, or accessories. Selecting up to three categories is advisable, as exceeding five categories can increase the deposit to as much as 20,000 RMB. This selection process helps in better inventory management and targeted marketing. Additionally, focusing on specific categories allows the platform to better understand your store's niche, making it easier to recommend your products to interested users. Proper category selection is a strategic step that can significantly impact your store's success."

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu offers three types of stores: personal, individual business, and enterprise. Each type has its own requirements and benefits. A personal store is the easiest to set up, requiring only an ID card and a 1000 RMB refundable deposit. It's ideal for beginners and small sellers. An individual business store requires a business license and a 600 RMB certification fee. This type allows for more extensive operations and can register up to six stores using three business licenses. An enterprise store also requires a business license and a 600 RMB certification fee. It can register two stores per license and bind three enterprises or individuals to each store. Understanding these differences helps in choosing the right store type based on your business needs and scale. For most beginners, a personal store is sufficient, but as your business grows, you may consider upgrading to an individual business or enterprise store."

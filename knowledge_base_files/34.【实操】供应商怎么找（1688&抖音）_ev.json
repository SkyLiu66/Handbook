        "Content": "Selecting reliable suppliers on 1688 involves several key steps to ensure you are partnering with trustworthy and capable manufacturers. First, use the platform's search features to find factories that match your desired product style. Look for suppliers with a long operational history, as this indicates stability and reliability. For example, a factory that has been in business for 19 years is likely more dependable than one that has only been around for a year. Additionally, check the factory's details such as its establishment date, factory size, and customer reviews. High ratings and positive feedback are good indicators of a reliable supplier. It's also important to verify if the supplier is willing to provide drop shipping services if needed. Contacting the supplier directly via phone or online chat can help clarify these details. Lastly, consider the supplier's fulfillment rate and customer return rate, as these metrics reflect the quality of their products and services. By following these steps, you can identify and select reliable suppliers on 1688."

        "Content": "Finding suppliers on Douyin requires a different approach compared to traditional e-commerce platforms. Douyin provides various metrics to evaluate suppliers, such as product experience scores, logistics experience scores, and seller service scores. Focus on suppliers with high product and logistics experience scores to ensure timely delivery and good product quality. Additionally, examine the variety of products offered by the supplier. A supplier with a wide range of products can be more beneficial as it allows you to source multiple items from a single supplier, simplifying logistics and communication. When evaluating suppliers, also consider their willingness to provide drop shipping services. Suppliers who only list a phone number for contact may be less responsive or selective about their clients. Therefore, prioritize suppliers who offer multiple contact methods and are open to new business relationships. By carefully evaluating these factors, you can find reliable suppliers on Douyin who meet your business needs."

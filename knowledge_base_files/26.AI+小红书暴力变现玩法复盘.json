This is because homework serves as a practical application of the concepts taught in class, allowing students to reinforce their learning. Additionally, reviewing homework helps the instructor identify areas where students may be struggling and provide targeted feedback. To ensure that all students are on the same page, the instructor reviews the first three homework assignments and provides feedback on the quality of the work submitted. This process helps students understand the expectations and standards required for successful completion of the course."

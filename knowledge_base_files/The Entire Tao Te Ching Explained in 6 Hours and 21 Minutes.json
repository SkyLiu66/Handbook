    "data": " Okay, okay, I'll make a 6 hour compilation of all my Tao Te Ching videos. You guys have been begging me to do this for months now and I've finally done it. So here it is. Every single chapter of the Tao Te Ching explained in a video that is… way too long. The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth. The named is the mother of the ten thousand things. Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations. These two spring from the same source but differ in name. This appears as darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery. Alright, so this chapter is a little esoteric, so let's go ahead and break it down piece by piece. The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. I've heard a lot of people going on about how this passage means that we should never talk or write about Taoism. Now I think this is silly because these lines are literally taken out of a text about Taoism. So if we are maintaining that Taoism should not be talked about or taught, then we are saying that the entire Tao Te Ching is nothing but a massive work of hypocrisy. So I think we can rule this out. What I think is really being said here is that however well you can describe something, you're never really going to hit it on the head. Because of this, names and descriptions of things are imprecise, especially when we're dealing with something as complex and mysterious as the Tao. I think Laozi, the alleged author of the Tao Te Ching, is basically saying to us that the writings in this book cannot possibly describe the Tao in any sort of adequate way, but are instead there to try and point us in the right direction so that we can get closer to the Tao ourselves, and only then will we be able to really start to understand it. This is true of anything really. You could have a friend describe the Grand Canyon to you for hours and hours, and you'd never be able to wrap your head around what it's really like as well as you would if you had stood on the edge of the real thing for even just a single minute. Words, names, and descriptions of things are not the things themselves. In order to really understand the thing itself, you have to really experience it in person. How do you experience the Tao? Well, let's look a few lines down. Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations. The Tao is the Tao of the world. So one of the main principles of Taoism is this idea of overcoming desire rather than allowing our desires to overcome us. We'll talk about this a lot more in future chapters, but for now, let's focus on these lines. Our values, desires, and perceptions shape the way that we see the world around us. Have you ever noticed that two people can be present for the same event and yet describe it in completely different ways? Well, this is because we human beings are just not very objective in the way we perceive and interpret our environments. Let's take a hypothetical situation of two kids walking around the park. Let's say that one child has a dog at home that he really loves and plays with often, and that he has never had a negative experience with dogs before. Now let's say that the other child has no dog, but once he was bitten by a neighbor's dog so badly that the dog had to literally be pulled off of him. Child number one sees this dog and probably perceives an opportunity to enjoy the company of a kind animal. Child number two might see this dog and perceive nothing but a threat to his safety. Which child is right? Well, the answer is we don't know, because we don't have enough information yet. But now say the dog comes running toward the two children. Child one, based on his experience, sees a dog coming to play, while child two sees a dog running up to attack. Both children are so involved in the story of what they have previously experienced that neither child is able to perceive the possibility of anything else. Neither child is seeing reality. Both are seeing only a replay of a past experience. 2. This is a way to teach us to put aside our prejudices, experiences, and desires, and to learn to see things as they truly are. This is certainly not an easy thing to do, but part of it is to acknowledge that you have a predisposition to see the world in a certain way. This is usually a way that legitimizes what you already believe. And I'm not talking about just politics or current events or left versus right or anything like that. I mean, when you go outside your house and look at the world around you, can you keep yourself open to receiving the information that each thing is presenting to you about itself? Rather than projecting your own inferences onto the world around you? The answer is no, you probably can't. And neither can I, for that matter. We just haven't learned to do that yet. This is a process that starts with learning to accept the world, as well as circumstances in your life, for what they really are. This doesn't mean that you never get to do anything about them. But before you can do anything about them, you have to see them for what they are, and in order to do that, you have to accept them as they really are. We're going to talk about this a lot more in later chapters, but for now, we can just walk away with the understanding that we are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the we are not familiar with, we don't understand the world around us completely, because of what we are unable to accept, because of other jin zero experiences we are holding onto, or because of what we want to be true. Hence the line, ever desiring, one sees the manifestations. This is especially true when we're trying to understand Tao. In order to do this, we need to be able to put aside our notion and our predispositions about it, and really getting waist-deep in it for ourselves. I hope this is making sense So far. When people see things as beautiful, ugliness is created. When people see things as good, evil is created. Being and non-being produce each other. Difficult and easy complement each other. Long and short define each other. High and low oppose each other. For and aft follow each other. Therefore, the master can act without doing anything and teach without saying a word. Things come her way and she does not stop them. Things leave and she lets them go. She has without possessing and acts without any expectations. When her work is done, she takes no credit. That is why it will last forever. Okay, so there are a few different themes in this chapter, so let's start with the first two lines. When people see things as beautiful, ugliness is created. When people see things as good, evil is created. So this is our first example in the Tao Te Ching of a concept called non-duality. Now, if you go back and look for the definition of non-duality, you'll find all kinds of different things. But for our purposes here, non-duality is the understanding of the oneness of all things, including things that seem to be opposite and distinct. This runs pretty against how most people, especially those who are raised in Western culture, are used to viewing the world. We perceive all things as separate, but through the lens of non-duality, we can see them as one. Our tendency to see things as separate and distinct often comes from our habit of seeing things as one. When people see things as good, we can see them as one. Our tendency to see things as good, we can see them as one. Our tendency to see things as good, we can see them as one. Our tendency to see things as one. Our tendency to making judgments about the people and things around us. Even the things that appear to be objectively opposite, such as longness or shortness, are two sides of the same coin. Now, some people take the first few lines of this passage to mean that there is no such thing as good, evil, beauty, or ugliness, that these are all concepts we conceive of ourselves and that don't have any basis in reality. Well, it is possible that that's what the author meant, but let's take a look at another translation. The Xiaofu Feng translation renders these lines this way. Under heaven, all can see beauty as beauty, only because there is ugliness. All can know good as good, only because there is evil. Now, this translation makes these lines out to mean something more like this. We only know the existence of goodness when we have experienced the existence of evil, and we only can recognize beauty because we have also experienced ugliness. The difference here is subtle, but it is significant. One translation holds that good and evil are concepts created by people. The other holds that good and evil exist together. The other holds that good and evil exist together. We can come to know them by experiencing both sides. So, which did the author mean? Well, we may never know, so for now, I think we have to feel it out for ourselves. However, whether you believe in the existence of good or evil, we can acknowledge that we are not always perfect judges of what is good and what is bad. Some things that happen in our lives seem to be bad, but turn out in the end to have worked out for the best. There's a pretty well-known quote by Alan Watts where he tells a story of a Chinese farmer. I'll read it off here in case you haven't heard it before. Once upon a time, there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, The next day, the horse came back, bringing seven wild horses with it. And in the evening, everyone came back and said, The following day, his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, Oh dear, that's too bad. And the farmer responded, Maybe. The next day, the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again, all the neighbors came around and said, Isn't that great? Again, he said, Maybe. The point of this story is that since we can't see the future or even everything in the present, we sometimes get a bit ahead of ourselves when we jump to conclusions about whether something is good or bad. This is why Chinese farmers are so good at explaining the truth. They're so good at explaining the truth. In chapter 2 of the Tao Te Ching tells us that, The master can act without doing anything and teach without saying a word. This is why things come her way and she does not stop them. Things leave and she lets them go. She has without possessing and acts without any expectations. The master understands that there is so much that she doesn't know. And so rather than putting judgments onto things that happen, she allows them to be what they are, and she just lets them come and go. So does this mean that the master is lazy or idle? Not at all. The master accomplishes many things, often more than the master does. She doesn't do this by trying to force things to go her way. She does this by observing how things are going and acting on the opportunities that are presented to her. And when the results of her work appear, she doesn't take credit for them. Not because she's trying to be modest or because she's trying to talk down how good they are, but because she knows that taking credit for what has been done would be the silliest thing in the world to do. After all, she didn't do them all herself. She allowed an opportunity to unfold, she took it, and she allowed the result to happen naturally. So what is there for her to do? What is there for her to take credit for? If you overly esteem talented individuals, people will become overly competitive. If you overvalue possessions, people will begin to steal. Do not display your treasures, or people will become envious. The master leads by emptying people's minds, filling their bellies, weakening their ambitions, and making them become strong. Preferring simplicity and freedom from desires, avoiding the pitfalls of knowledge and wrong actions. For those who practice non-doing, everything will fall into place. Well, I think it pretty much goes without saying that the world we live in goes soundly against most of this advice. We live in a culture that basically worships talent. Our society teaches us to believe that talent and achievement are the greatest measures of success, while decency and humanity are often all but ignored. Along with this comes the extremely high value we put on material possessions, since we often worship talent as a means of getting these things. And where do we go from here? To people becoming overly competitive in order to acquire more possessions, at which point they will often display them for others to envy. Now I do want to talk a little bit about competition here for a second, lest we immediately throw the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak. The Tao Te Ching does acknowledge the reality of competition in the world. For example, the Xiaofu Feng translation of chapter 68 states that, A good winner is not vengeful, implying that there will be situations where there is a winner and a loser. All throughout the Tao Te Ching, we are taught to seek to emulate nature, yet nature is full of competition. Animals, plants, and organisms of all kinds compete for food, water, mates, and shelter. I think the point here is, when you do compete, how do you do it? Do you embody Bu Wei in the doing of your task? Do you allow the competition to take its course and remain focused on your part in it, or do you try to force things to go your way? Consider the martial art of Tai Chi, which is closely linked with Taoism. Tai Chi, as a martial art, is a form of self-defense, and it is a form of self-defense. It is a form of self-defense, and it is a form of self-defense. It is a form of self-defense, and it is a form of self-defense. Tai Chi, after all, is a martial art. Martial arts are competitive by nature. However, Tai Chi embodies the philosophy of Taoism by adopting the ideas of yielding and softness. It theorizes that the fighter that is able to flow with the tide of the battle gains an advantage. As said in Chapter 76 of the Tao Te Ching, An army without flexibility never wins a battle. A tree that is unbending is easily broken. The hard and strong will fall. The soft and weak will overcome. The Master understands this concept. He or she can become strong, and the��o is one who is strong. The teacher understands this concept and teaches it to others. For this reason, he or she leads by weakening people's ambitions, thereby making them become strong. Taoism of the Tao and Its Effect The Tao is an empty vessel. It is used but never filled. Oh unfathomable source of ten thousand things! Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knot, soften the glare, merge with dust. Oh hidden deep but ever present! I do not know from whence it comes. Oh hidden deep but ever present! I do not know from whence it comes. It is the forefront from whence it comes. It is the forefather of the gods. So this phrase, the 10,000 things, is one that's often used throughout the Tao Te Ching, and it has a few different meanings depending on who you ask. Usually, the 10,000 things are held to represent all the things in the world or in reality, or the material diversity of the universe. The 10,000 things are also sometimes held to represent all the little distractions that clutter our minds and our lives. Either way, this chapter is basically speaking about the transcendency of the Tao. We are told that the Tao will outlast all things, the sharpest edge, the tightest knot, even the brightest light. Before all of these things was the Tao, and after they cease, the Tao will continue to exist, even as all the things in the world expire and go back to the dust they were made from. The chapter says that the Tao is hidden from our sight but exists wherever and whenever anything is, and has done so as long as anyone on earth can comprehend, even longer than the concept of God. Now, if you are religious, this phrase might bother you a bit, but consider this. There are some laws or forces that even the gods cannot defy. An example from Greek mythology comes in the form of the Myrre, the three sisters of fate, who spin the fortunes of gods and humans alike. One can also look to the story of Phaethon, in which the god Helios promised Phaethon any favor he asked for, and could not revoke his promise, even when the mortal foolishly asked to drive his chariot across the sky to bring in the sun, which led him to the top of the mountain. This led to terrible destruction both in heaven and on earth. Even in modern Christianity, Christ had to be sent as an intermediary for people because God was not able to defy the laws of justice by simply letting them off when they chose sin. The Tao Te Ching sets up the Tao as part of this universal law, part of the framework upon which all known reality is built. In my opinion, this means a religious person need not shy away from the teachings of the Tao at all, as they are not mutually exclusive. Heaven and Earth are impartial. They try to destroy the world, but they are not. They try to destroy the world, but they are not. They try to destroy the world, but they are not. They treat all of creation as straw dogs. The master doesn't take sides. She treats everyone like a straw dog. The space between heaven and earth is like a bellows. It is empty, yet has not lost its power. The more it is used, the more it produces. The more you talk of it, the less you comprehend. It is better not to speak of things you do not understand. So the straw dogs talked about here were figures of dogs used as props in ancient Chinese ceremonies. The straw dog is generally used to symbolize something that has a little worth, or that is discarded after use. This metaphor is basically to say that we should strive not to take sides, and should regard people objectively and impartially. Now, let's talk about this part about heaven and earth being like a bellows. A bellows is only useful for its job because it is empty inside. If it were filled with things, it wouldn't work properly. Can you think of any other objects that are useful only because they're empty? Things like buckets, bowls, cups, or even rooms come to mind. But this applies not only to objects, but to people as well, what does it mean for a person to be empty? Well, that could mean a lot of things. For example, perhaps the emptiness Lao Tzu is talking about refers to a lack of ambitions or distractions to cloud our judgment. Have you ever ended a meditation that just really felt like you got what you needed out of it? How would you describe how you feel after a really good meditation like that? Maybe this is different for different people. For me though, after a really good meditation, I feel empty. I feel like my mind is clear and uncluttered. It's kind of like that moment where you spray off your windshield while you're driving, and the wipers make the first couple of wipes, and you just get this moment of realizing how dirty your windshield really was, and what a relief it is now to have it so clean and clear. Emptiness in our minds and hearts adds clarity. It makes a space for intuition to come through. I think maybe this is one of the reasons for the line, the more you talk of it, the less you comprehend. As we already learned in chapter one, words and names are not precise, and sometimes I think too much explaining can clog the gears up a little bit. If you over-explain something, it doesn't leave as much space for you to understand or intuition to work, and this can lead to confusion. So, in the spirit of not over-explaining, I'll leave it there for today. The valley spirit never dies. It is named the mysterious female, and the doorway of the mysterious female is the base from which heaven and earth spring. It is there within us all the while. Draw upon it as you will, it never runs dry. So rather than just interpreting this chapter, I'd like to just lay a bit of groundwork to hopefully let you use your own intuition and to draw your own conclusions about it. The valley spirit mentioned in the third line has also been translated as the spirit of emptiness, or even just the Tao. The doorway of the mysterious female, sometimes rendered as the subtle female, has been sometimes suggested to allude to the gateway of a woman's womb. All throughout the Tao Te Ching, the traditional characteristics of the female, i.e. submissiveness, humility, quietness, generosity, etc., are applauded and endorsed. The Tao Te Ching certainly is one of the few ancient texts to do, it would have been in pretty stark contrast to the prescribed cultural norms for men of Lao Tzu's day. In today's day, this runs counter to the culturally prescribed norms for any sex, as many of these quote-unquote traditionally feminine characteristics have begun to fall out of favor even for women. Please understand that neither I nor Lao Tzu are making any political statements about equality or gender roles. Lao Tzu was not putting one sex above another, rather he was encouraging both men and women to cultivate in themselves certain human characteristics above others. This was rather a way of showing that the Tao Te Ching was not just a political institution, but a political institution in the form of a political institution. It was radical then, and it's radical now, not because of any political implications, but because of its endorsement of human qualities that are and were supremely undervalued. The Tao is often described in terms of these traits. So what do you think this means for us? I understand that whenever we talk about things like gender, there is a potential for things to get political, so let's just be kind to each other in the comments and have equality discussion, without putting words in each other's mouths. Heaven lasts long and earth abides. What is the secret of the Tao Te Ching? The Tao Te Ching is the secret of their durability. Is it not because they do not live for themselves that they can live so long? Therefore the sage wants to remain behind, but finds himself at the head of others, reckons himself out, but finds himself safe and secure. Is it not because he is selfless that his self is realized? So this chapter presents the idea of heaven and earth not living for themselves, and that it is for this reason that they are so long lived. Living for oneself is exhausting. Self-centeredness and self-preservation are very demanding states of mind. Impatience weighs on your soul and snatches up the happiness of the present moment, as it always points towards something in the future. A person who desperately guards the things they desire, or to which they feel entitled, will be haunted by phantoms of the future . A person that is simply living in and observing the present moment is open to all the joy, satisfaction, and opportunities available in the future. in the present moment, while a person consumed by self-interest will be blinded to many of these things. I remember one time in my life while serving in a volunteer capacity, I had a desire for a leadership position within the organization. These leadership roles were rotated regularly and appointed by the leaders of the organization. I felt that a leadership position in the organization would help me feel somehow legitimized, like I was good enough of a person to be asked to lead. But the position never came. I got so worked up about this that whenever I thought about it, it caused me a lot of frustration and anxiety. Was there a reason why others around me were getting put into these positions and I wasn't? Was there something wrong with me? Well, I think the best possible thing that could have happened, happened. I was appointed to a mid-level leadership position for a short period of time and then released from that position again. Surprisingly, I felt a sort of freedom after this. I suddenly realized having been on both ends, how little it mattered. Leadership positions don't exist to legitimize the person serving in them. They exist to serve the people being led. Therefore, the sage is perfectly fine to act in whatever capacity he finds himself in, but finds himself in leadership capacities anyway. In the words of Albus Dumbledore, It is a curious thing, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who have leadership thrust upon them and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they were it well. Another translation of the latter half of chapter 7 reads, Ultimately, being fulfilled is what we all want. But I don't think we can become fulfilled by striving to be fulfilled, by chasing after things, or by accomplishing some goal in the future. We become fulfilled by being able to do away with the clamor of, so that we can see and feel in the present moment the influence of our intuition, which will guide us in the direction of what our souls came to achieve. It is only in losing ourselves that we eventually find ourselves. The highest good is like water. Water gives life to the ten thousand things and does not strive. It flows in places men reject, and so is like the Tao. In dwelling, be close to the land. In meditation, go deep in the heart. In dealing with others, be gentle and kind. In speech, be true. In ruling, be just. In daily life, be competent. In action, be aware of the time and the season. No fight, no blame. Now, this is probably not the first time you've been told to be like water, and it probably won't be the last. Water has a lot of the qualities prescribed by Taoism, and indeed, much of Eastern philosophy. Water can trickle as a stream, or it can crash as a wave, but it always does its work by going with the flow of the land, by utilizing the environment around it, and by not striving to make things into that which they are not. The chapter mentions that water flows in places men reject. This is also sometimes translated as water flows into low places. Water follows the pull of gravity. It doesn't mind being lower than everybody else. Similarly, a master doesn't mind being seen as lower or less important. In fact, he chooses these places. It is an example of how water flows. Water is creative, gentle, honest, fair, and kind. He is competent in what he does, but he does not assert his dominance. Although his skill may be great, he knows when is the time to employ it and when it is not. He understands that there is a time and a season for everything. He doesn't blame others. He doesn't pick fights. He does his thing, and he isn't concerned about the result. If we can learn to emulate these qualities, we will find that we, like water, can accomplish much while striving very little. It is easier to carry an empty cup than one that is filled to the brim. The sharper the knife, the easier it is to dull. The more wealth you possess, the harder it is to protect. Pride brings its own trouble. When you have accomplished your goal, simply walk away. This is the pathway to heaven. In this chapter, we are talking a lot about the dangers of excess, and the wisdom of knowing when enough is enough. There is a concept out there called the law of diminishing returns. This law, which is often used in mathematics, business, science, or economics, to name a few, states that in many matters, there is a point where the gains or profits realized from more investment of money, time, or effort become diminished relative to the money, time, or effort that will be required to realize these returns. For example, an owner of a toothpaste factory may assume that he or she could double production by doubling the amount of workers in the factory. However, they may discover that there is just not enough work in the factory to efficiently employ that man. This is the reason why the company is so poor. The company is not able to work efficiently and the company is not able to employ that many workers, leading to diminished returns. I saw another example of diminishing returns when I was working as an audio-visual technician. For those of you who don't know, these are the guys who run the lights, projectors, slides, and microphones whenever you go to a large event. Working in audio-visual, or AV, we often joked about the fact that most of our effort went towards improvements that only we would notice. It can be tempting to get very granular in a job like AV. In an attempt to get the audio just perfect, we often joke about the fact that we are not able to do the work we want to do. You see, we have the lighting perfect. We have the lighting placement perfect. We have any number of other things. And there are some productions where this sort of thing really does matter. But, especially in live events, the truth is that almost nobody will notice anything about the audio-visual elements, unless something goes horribly wrong. Such as the lights not turning on in time, or the microphones ringing. There comes a point in AV where added effort just stops contributing significantly to the experience of the customer. You see diminishing returns in many areas of life. Laozi gives us a couple examples. It's harder to drink out of a cup that is full to the brim. A sharp knife is useful for many tasks, but an overly sharp knife loses its durability. Amassing more and more wealth leads to more headaches. Our brains are wired to think that more of a good thing is always better, but this is not the case. There comes a point when enough is just enough. When I first started making videos, I was a total perfectionist. And because of the time it would take me to actually get a video out, not to mention the stress, I would just stop uploading for months at a time, because it just felt so overwhelming. Since then, I've tried to adopt a done-is-better-than-perfect approach. Sure, the production quality of my videos is nowhere near that of other channels out there, but at least I'm doing it now, and I can improve the quality as I go. There's an old saying in writing that projects are never finished, only do. There is always something you could do to make a project better. But eventually, you just have to do it. You just have to be able to know when to call it a day. I think this is mainly a function of intuition. At least that's how it is for me. Whatever the case, knowing when enough is enough is an important life skill, and one of the many virtues of the Tao. Can you love people and lead them without forcing your will on them? When heaven gives and takes away, can you be content with the outcome? When you understand all things, can you step back from your own understanding? Giving birth and nourishing, making without possessing, expecting nothing in return, to grow yet not to control, this is the mysterious virtue. So, I think one common misunderstanding about Taoism is the conflation of humiliation and ignorance. humiliation and ignorance. humiliation and ignorance. Humiliation and softness with weakness and apathy. Taoism teaches us to be soft, but it does not teach us to be weak. On the contrary, the Tao Te Ching instructs us to improve ourselves as much as we possibly can. It's just that self-improvement for a Taoist often looks quite different from the self-improvement we see all around us in the rest of the world. And let's just establish one thing here. Taoism and self-improvement do indeed go hand in hand. The first lines of chapter 10 read, Nurture the darkness of your soul until you become whole. Nurturing your soul, letting it become whole, this is a kind of self-mastery. But it isn't the self-mastery that comes from aggressively trying to eradicate all of your faults. It isn't making a list of all your problems and making goals to fix them. Lists and goals can be helpful, and they can have their place, but the Tao Te Ching prescribes a different kind of healing. Think of what it means to nurture your soul. Another translation renders this passage as, Husbanding the animal and spiritual souls. Another reads, Can you coax your mind from its wandering and keep to the original oneness? Now, obviously, each of these translations differ quite a bit. When I read the Tao Te Ching, I like to read several translations side by side to try to pick out the main theme that's shared by all of them. Kind of like using multiple lenses in an optical instrument to bring a picture into greater clarity. If you put each of these translations alongside each other, you can see that this nurturing of the soul is not a forced, agendized agenda or an itemized to-do list, but rather a gentle guiding of the mind and spirit into harmony one with another. Do you remember what it was like when you first started learning to meditate? Or if you're still learning, as we certainly all are, can you think of the first few times you ever tried it? Many people experience their first few attempts at meditation as frustrating and difficult. When I hear people talk about quote-unquote failed attempts at meditation, I most often hear them saying things like, I just can't get my mind to slow down. This betrays a common and totally natural misunderstanding about meditation, which is the idea that meditation is about forcing your mind to calm down and stop thinking. Well, of course, this just doesn't work. One of the most certain methods of getting yourself to think about something is telling yourself not to think about it. So, in meditation, we don't try to do this. We allow the mind to do whatever it wants to do. We just choose not to engage with it as it does so. We simply watch the thoughts come and go without dwelling on them. Like we are sitting on the side of the road, watching cars drive by, or watching a car drive by. Now, to bring it all back, this definitely takes repetition and practice, but it isn't the sort of thing that you can force to happen. People that teach meditation will often say to gently guide your mind back each time you feel it being carried away by a particular thought. Learning to meditate involves a lot of this gentle guiding back of the mind. Each time you do this, it strengthens your ability to remain a passive observer of your thoughts. This is practice. You are practicing meditation. Learning to master your brain's impulses to get caught up in thought is a kind of self-mastery. But self-mastery in this sense, as you can see, is not the same as forcing. Chapter 33 of the Tao Te Ching tells us, Those who master others are strong. Those who master themselves have true power. So, while Taoism absolutely is concerned with self-mastery, it teaches a new way of going about it. You are not learning by force of will to behave differently. You are learning to think differently, to see the world differently. Change in behavior is merely a natural result of a change in our personal nature. Now, I can see I've taken up the entire length of this video on only the first two lines of the passage, so I think I might need to make this chapter into a two-part video. So keep an eye out for the second one. Chapter 34 of the Tao Te Ching Nurture the darkness of your soul until you become whole. Can you do this and not fail? Can you focus your life breath until you become supple as a newborn child? While you cleanse your inner vision, will you be found without fault? Can you love people and lead them without forcing your will on them? When heaven gives and takes away, can you be content with the outcome? When you understand all things, can you take a step back from your own understanding? Giving birth and nourishing, making without possessing, expecting nothing in return, to grow yet not to control, this is the mysterious virtue. So, last time we broke down chapter 10, and we spent so much time on the first few lines we left a lot unsaid about the rest of the chapter. So this is going to be kind of a part 2 to chapter 10, because today I want to get into the rest of the chapter, but especially I want to touch on what I feel is sort of the main theme of the chapter, what I call inner softness. Chapter 10 gives several different examples of behavior or events that will result from this state of natural softness. We broke down the first one in the last video. The next example we encounter is in the next line. Focus your life breath until you become supple as a newborn child. This life breath comes from the word qi. Qi is an ancient Chinese concept that refers to a sort of life energy that flows throughout the universe and throughout all people. The ability to focus your qi in this way is indicative of great ability and focus. Laozi is telling us to develop the ability to be able to master and hone ourselves while staying as flexible and non-forcing as a small baby. Many other religions and philosophies advise us to emulate the innocence of children. Jesus also said to become as little children. Children are humble, patient, and quick to forgive. Likewise in leadership, we are told to love people and lead them without forcing our will on them. Love comes before lead. When we truly love someone, we take them as a part of ourselves. We conflate their best interests with our best interests. True love for someone is giving them what they need the most when they deserve it the least at great personal cost if necessary. A master understands that leadership is not an opportunity for self-aggrandizement. His primary focus is on loving the people whom he leads. When circumstances do not go his way, he doesn't fret about them. He doesn't waste time or energy wishing they were something they are not. He allows things to be given to him and taken from him, knowing that this is the way of the universe, and allowing things to be as they are. As his understanding of all things grows, so does his openness to seeing things as they really are. This is in contrast to the archetypical scholar or pedant, which, as he learns more, increasingly begins to shove things into the little boxes that he has created for interpreting them. The scholar puts great emphasis on capitalism, categorizing and naming things. The master recognizes that the obsessive naming and categorizing of things often does more harm than good, as it can lead us to make assumptions of things or see them as cast in concrete, rather than being subject to new or continued observation. He is present to observe the stories that all things tell about themselves, rather than trying to write the stories for them. He is like the sun, which sustains, nourishes, and brings life to things without laying any arbitrary claims of ownership to them, and without having any expectations of being paid back. This is the virtue of inner softness, the quiet, present, open, pliable state in which the master resides, where he can freely observe and hear his or her intuition. We experience something like this when we meditate, or when we spend time alone in nature. Learning to reside in this state is one of the most important things we can do to lead happier lives, and to allow ourselves to become more in harmony with the Tao. Thirty spokes are joined together in a wheel, but it is the center hole that allows the wheel to function. We mold clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that makes the vessel useful. We fashion wood for a house, but it is the emptiness inside that makes it livable. We work with the substantial, but the emptiness is what we use. All throughout the Tao Te Ching, we are instructed to learn to embrace emptiness, or to become empty. Today, I want to talk a little more in detail about why it is important to empty ourselves. and what that means. This idea of emptiness is certainly open to interpretation. But for me, I've always seen this emptiness as an ability to let go of desires, and to allow our minds to be free of distractions, ambitions, assumptions, and arbitrary ideas about the way things ought to be. Lao Tzu offers several examples of things that are useful because of their emptiness. A cup, a room, the center hole of a wheel. Notice that in each of these examples, an argument could possibly be made that the emptiness is useful not for the fact of its existence, but because its emptiness allows it to be filled with something else. A cup is only useful because it is empty, because then you are able to fill it with something you want to hold. Likewise, emptiness of the heart and mind is not an end in and of itself, but a means to an end. What is this end? For us to be able to hear our own intuition. Intuition is the lifeblood of Wu Wei. Our intuition is what allows us to take the best path to reach our goals. When we are filled with desires, aspirations, and assumptions as to what things are or how they ought to be done, our perception and judgment become clouded. Only when we have put these things aside are we able to hear the soft voice of that guide. A person who is set upon a goal may exert great effort for months in order to accomplish what a person who is empty enough to listen to intuition can accomplish in a few days. Our intuition is able to show to us shortcuts and workarounds that we wouldn't otherwise see. It teaches us things about ourselves that we wouldn't otherwise know, and that allow us to complete our tasks in a few days. We can also learn to understand and understand things in ways that work for us. If we can allow ourselves to let go of assumptions about the way things should be done, we will be open for our intuition and subconscious to help us out. In thinking about how best to describe this concept, I was reminded of a story I read in the excellent book, The Inner Game of Tennis by W. Timothy Galway. In the book, Galway tells about a coaching session he was having with a new tennis player. Galway was an experienced tennis coach who had always taught by the traditional method of watching the client play, and then offering critiques on individual things the player needed to improve about his or her swing, grip, footwork, or any number of other things. However, Galway began to notice that as he would give players these instructions, they would get so bogged down about trying hard to think about the things he was telling them, that improvement was slow and painstaking. So in this lesson, he decided to try something different. While teaching a man he names Paul, instead of giving him various pointers, he told him to watch while he, the instructor, swung the racket in the direction of the player. He then gave him a few pointers, and then he gave him a few more. Paul swung the racket in the proper way ten times. He told Paul to simply watch him, get a mental image of what he was doing, and then repeat the motion himself. After he had done the stroke ten times, Paul said, I noticed that the first thing you did was move your feet. Galway didn't reply to this, but told Paul to imitate the motion as best he could. Paul swung the racket in a near-perfect imitation of what Galway had done. It was an incredible first attempt, far exceeding the instructor's expectations, except for one thing. Paul forgot to move his feet. He had done everything almost perfectly, except for the one thing he had been consciously trying to do. When we get caught up in trying too hard to do things the right way, we often find that we are unable to do them correctly. By trying too hard, we get in our own way. This is why this state of emptiness is so important. This is the concept of action through non-action. The best work we do is usually instinctual and largely subconscious. If we can learn to empty ourselves of doubts, judgments, desires, and preconceived notions, we will find our ability to perform in useful ways will be greatly increased. The five colors blind the eye. The five tones deafen the ear. The five flavors dull the taste. Racing and hunting madden the mind. Precious things lead one astray. Therefore, the sage is guided by what he feels and not by what he sees. He lets go of that and chooses this. In ancient Chinese culture, the number five was highly significant. They believed in five elements, water, earth, fire, wood, and metal. In ancient Chinese color theory, there are five colors, red, yellow, black, white, and the conflation of blue and green. There are five tones in the Chinese musical scale, and five flavors, salty, spicy, sweet, sour, and bitter. The basic gist of the first three lines of this chapter is that an excess of pretty much anything leads to undesirable results. A skilled artist, musician, or chef knows that in a painting, dish, or piece of music, less is often more. A good dish is created by building the entire recipe to highlight one or two key flavors. A good painting makes special use of a few particular colors, and a good piece of music features a main musical idea, known as the melody, supported by other instruments in the background. If a painting tried to use every color in the rainbow, or a piece of music tried to have several different melodies at once, the result is not as desirable. In art, as in life, it is often just as much about what you do not put in as what you do put in. This principle applies to many aspects of life. One area of my life where I have seen this concept illustrated has been in eating. Currently, I practice intermittent fasting during the day. For me, this means that during the day I only eat between 11am and 2pm, and then once at dinner around 6pm and nothing after that. Opinions about fasting and the optimal times to do so are incredibly numerous, but this is a schedule that seems to work well for me right now. When I first decided to try intermittent fasting, I had doubts about whether I would be able to maintain the regime. I worried that by limiting the times I could eat, I would start to get less enjoyment out of eating. However, I found the opposite to be true. Although it isn't always fun to go without food during my fasting periods, I've learned that by regularly abstaining from food during the day, I can actually get a lot more enjoyment out of food during my fasting periods. In fact, I at first scheduled one day a week where I would take a break from my fasting routine and eat whatever I wanted. But after the first couple weeks, I actually discontinued the practice, opting instead to maintain the diet every day. I stopped taking breaks because I found that eating was actually a lot less fun on the days where I could eat whenever I wanted. I'm not sharing this story to endorse intermittent fasting, but to illustrate the concept of eliminating excess to maximize satisfaction. The second half of this passage has been translated several different ways. The translation that I have used for this video says, The sage is guided by what he feels and not by what he sees. Another translation renders it as, The sage attends to the inner and not to the outer. However, many translations translate the part about the inner, or what is felt, as having to do with the stomach, such as in this translation. Therefore, the sage seeks to satisfy the craving of the belly, and not the insatiable longing of the eyes. I actually like each of these translations for different reasons, and I think by using each of them together, we can get an idea for the full picture. Language is complex, and Lao Tzu often used words and phrases that could have held double meaning. To get an understanding of this passage, we need to understand a bit of background. In ancient Chinese medicine, the stomach is sort of the center or the core of the human body. It is where the power and energy comes from, or where the qi, or life energy, is said to be concentrated and focused. Therefore, referring to the stomach can have multiple meanings here. We can be talking about the physical needs of the body, in contrast to desires for riches and expensive luxuries, and how we should prioritize the former. However, we can also be talking about attending to our intuition, and the center of our consciousness and power, rather than focusing on the endless stream of sense experience that is paraded before our eyes. There's a lot to unpack here, and this is a great example of why reading multiple translations is beneficial, as each of these meanings offers us helpful wisdom. Favor and disgrace would seem equally to be feared. Honor and great calamity to be regarded as personal conditions of the same kind. What is meant by speaking thus of favor and disgrace? Disgrace is being in a low position after the enjoyment of favor. The getting that favor leads to the apprehension of losing it, and the losing it leads to the fear of still greater calamity. This is what is meant by saying that favor and disgrace would seem equally to be feared. And what is meant by saying that honor and great calamity are to be similarly regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body which I call myself. If I had not the body, what great calamity would come to me? Therefore, he who would administer the kingdom, honoring it as he honors his own person, may be employed to govern it. And he who would administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be entrusted with it. Okay, I know that the translation I picked for this chapter is a little wordy, but after looking over quite a few different translations, I finally settled on this one for the video because of its detail and clarity. In this chapter, we're dealing with honor, disgrace, and the meaning of true selfless love. The chapter starts out with this statement, favor and disgrace would seem equally to be feared, and then it goes on to explain itself. The long and short of it is that being honored and favored by others comes with many of the same dangers and discomforts as being hated or disgraced by them. Why is this? Because they both inspire fear in us. Being disliked or disgraced by others is a very uncomfortable feeling. It often leads to feelings of rejection and worthlessness. The need to be accepted by the tribe is a primal human instinct. This instinct has served humanity very well up to now, at least from a survival perspective. The need for a tribe of prehistoric humans to stick together in a world of cold, starvation, and wild animals is obvious. To these early human ancestors, being expelled from the tribe was probably about the same thing as a death sentence, because a solitary human would have had a much more difficult time surviving out in the wild than a group of humans supporting and protecting each other. In fact, human cooperation and prosocial behavior is often regarded by scientists, as one of the key factors that led to humanity's getting the upper hand on most other species, at least from an evolutionary perspective. However, this instinct for social survival has brought with it a certain amount of evolutionary baggage that does not serve us very well. No doubt our need for other people still exists, even if it's no longer for the purpose of fighting off wolves or foraging for food. We still need the support of people around us who care about us. But usually, it's not the matter of life and death that it was for our ancestors. However, for our brains, it's not the matter of life and death that it was for our ancestors. However, for our brains, it's not the matter of life and death that it was for our ancestors. Social rejection is still treated as if it were a matter of life and death. Therefore, being rejected or denounced by others leads to feelings of extreme fear or discomfort. However, being in great favor with other people also inspires these same feelings. If you understand a little bit about how the brain works, then you'll know that it utilizes pleasure-inducing chemicals to motivate us to do things that are beneficial for our physical survival, dopamine being the big one. However, as we covered in my two-part series on dopamine, our brains have moving dopamine baselines, that cause us to continue to seek these survival resources even if we already have enough. For this reason, there is no amount of food, comfort, or social validation that can satisfy us if we do not train our brains to think otherwise. Therefore, if we are relying on social acceptance in order to feel safe, we will never feel safe. We will always feel like we need more, and we will always be afraid to lose that which we have. Therefore, social rejection leads to fear of bad things happening, and fear of losing this honor. And at the end of the day, both of these situations are the result of our physicality. The fact that we have bodies and brains that revolve around physical survival causes us to be in constant fear of that survival being threatened. Hunger, cold, and rejection make us feel uncomfortable because we have bodies that are threatened by them. Most, if not all, of our suffering has to do with our existence in a physical world. So what are we to do about this? Well, the answer is a bit of a paradox. Our brains would certainly be inclined to think that the answer would be to struggle even harder to meet our needs. But instead, the chapter turns our focus outward. Lao-tzu takes a bit of a pivot here, and begins to talk about administering kingdoms, seemingly a change of topic. However, he is building upon the groundwork we have already laid by establishing the body as our main source of concern as physical beings. He says in essence, Okay, so you know how we talked about all of your concern and care being a result of the need to preserve the well-being of your physical body? Now take that same concern and care that you have for your body, and have it for other people. Treat them with the same deference and urgency that you would have for meeting your own physical needs for food, sleep, and safety. If you can do this, you are in a position to be trusted with the well-being of other people, because you have taken their well-being as your well-being, their needs as your needs. You are realizing your oneness with all people and all things. You are finding the state of primal union where the illusions of self and other begin to disappear. All rules for humans are the same. All rules for humans are the same. All rules for humans are the same. All rules for human behavior, all of morality comes down to this. To attain this love for all things and all people. And as always, please be aware that this is all just my interpretation of things, and I could be completely wrong. Feel free to take what is useful to you and leave that which is not. This is just how I see the world. We look at it and do not see it. It is invisible. We listen to it and do not hear it. It is inaudible. We touch it and do not feel it. It is intangible. These three elude our inquiries and hence merge into one. Not by its rising, it is bright. Nor by its sinking, it is dark. Infinite and eternal, it cannot be defined. It returns to nothingness. This is the form of the formless, being and non-being. It is nebulous and elusive. Meet it and you do not see its beginning. Follow it and you do not see its end. Stay with the ancient way in order to master what is present. Knowing the primeval beginning is the essence of the way. So this is another chapter describing the nature of the Tao. Invisible, inaudible, intangible, infinite and eternal, undefinable. Try as we might to pin it down with words, it constantly eludes our understanding. It is without beginning, it is without ending. This chapter is a good example of something that I think is becoming lost in our current society. The state of primal wonder. Primal wonder is the state which a human enters when they are overcome with awe at the greatness, vastness and beauty of things beyond themselves. We sometimes get a glimpse of this primal wonder when we travel to wonders in nature, such as the Grand Canyon, or when we marvel at the vastness of the stars in the night sky. This state could also be called reverence. Laozi seems to be overcome with this reverence and wonder as he describes the Tao. He marvels at its greatness, its simplicity, its unfathomability. You see this all throughout the Tao Te Tung. Primal wonder is a very important state to experience. In history, humanity has always been surrounded by things that invoke this primal wonder. For most of human existence, people have lived within nature. They've explored the countless beauties of this earth. Every single night, they were presented with a sky full of stars to capture their attention, and to serve as a reminder of how big the universe really is, and how small they are in comparison. Many different cultures have developed systems for observing and tracking the movements of the stars, which fascinated and intrigued them. They placed great importance on keeping track of the movements of the planets, and the coming and going of seasons on the earth which were so integral to their daily lives. Almost all cultures have hitherto held some sort of faith in higher power or powers that govern the universe. This reverence for things larger and more important than the self serves many purposes for humankind. Besides the simple fact of it being a wonderful state to experience, primal awe keeps us in check. It reminds us of how small our problems and accomplishments really are. It helps us to keep a perspective of what our place is, and it helps keep us from taking ourselves too seriously. However, our society is sadly running quite low on primal wonder at the present moment, and it shows in our attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. There may be several reasons for this. I think one obvious one is the fact that humankind is experiencing a separation from nature on a scale that has possibly never occurred in its entire history. Today, around 55% of the world's population is a primal wonder. Around 55% of the world's population is estimated to live in cities or urban areas, and this figure is projected to rise to nearly 70% by 2050. Now, there is nothing inherently evil or wrong about cities, but the worldwide migration toward urban living means that fewer and fewer people have opportunities to have regular experiences with nature. I mean, think about it. In a few short decades, over half the population could grow up without ever seeing the night sky, which is not very visible even in small cities. I consider myself a primal wonder. I consider myself to be very fortunate to have lived both in large cities and in very rural areas, to where I have experienced both. And I'm telling you, if you have never seen the night sky out in the middle of nowhere where there's no lights to obscure it, it is a transcendent experience. Humans have always had ample opportunity to be out in nature alone, but many people will rarely, if ever, get that opportunity in today's day. Even when we do go out in nature, it is often a version of nature that has been roped off, publicized, sterilized, and humanized, full of tourists and day trippers. In addition to the absence of nature in the life of the average person, is the absence of some being or force higher than the self. When you read chapter 14, you can almost feel the wonder that the Tao inspires in Lao Tzu. You can feel his reverence for it coming out of the very page. But many people today do not recognize any force higher than the self. I'm not saying this to put Taoists or any other philosophical group above another. To do this would be characteristically un-Taoist. But I do think it's incredibly important for human beings to have encounters with some force higher than the self. In nature, in meditation, or in whatever avenue they may find this. The state of primal wonder is an antidote for the hustle, bustle, and narcissism that plagues today's society. It roots us in reality. It checks our self-centeredness. If you feel like this feeling is lacking in your own life, I recommend actively beginning to seek it out, even in small ways. Getting out in nature is an excellent way to start this. Taking time for meditation and contemplation of topics higher than the self is a great way to continue the process. The ancient masters were subtle, mysterious, profound, responsive. The depth of their knowledge is unfathomable. Because it is unfathomable, all we can do is describe their appearance. Watchful, like a man crossing a winter stream. Alert, like a man aware of danger. Courteous, like visiting guests. Yielding, like ice about to melt. Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood. Hollow, like caves. Hake, like muddy pools. Who can wait quietly while the mud settles? Who can remain still until the moment of action? Observers of the Tao do not seek fulfillment. Not seeking fulfillment, they are not swayed by desire for change. So here we are getting a description of masters from the past. Laozi is invoking images of past sages for the purpose of showing what they were like, so that we can emulate them and their behavior. These masters were careful, deliberate, and slow to action. When crossing a winter stream, one wrong step can lead to disaster. It is a task that requires the utmost caution and care. Not that the masters were fearful, we don't have any justification in the text for thinking this, but they were careful and alert. Dealing with other people often requires delicacy and nuance, but often we treat people around us as if it didn't matter what we said or did. Not the ancient masters, though. They always tread with care and kindness. They purposely put themselves in the low places. They did not seek to be raised above anyone else, or to be celebrated because they understood that such behavior only inspires envy in others. Instead, they sought the low places, the functions of least honor. They treated others as if they were always their guests, always prepared to yield their own desires and plans should the situation call for it. Here we also get into a bit of a characteristic theme of Taoism, the uncarved block. In a world where people are so determined to make something of themselves, a sage prefers to keep him or herself simple, unadorned, and open to all possibilities. Now, there have been about a billion different interpretations of the uncarved block, and there are countless explanations for what it is supposed to mean. So rather than give just one interpretation, I think I would rather just explore several different properties of an uncarved piece of wood, and let you use your own intuition to draw your own conclusions. An uncarved piece of wood has many advantages over one that has been made into something. An uncarved block is in its natural state. It is the way nature has made it. It doesn't put up pretenses about being something it isn't. Wood that has been carved into a spoon, or a flute, or a statue, has one function, and is locked into that function forever. It has resigned itself to one duty, one task, one nature, and in this has become rigid and inflexible. In becoming one thing, it has closed the door to all other possibilities, all other lessons it might learn about itself, all other talents and potential that may lay dormant and undiscovered within it. An uncarved block of wood understands that there are basically infinite possibilities for how it might be useful. By residing in its natural state, it leaves itself open to any of these possibilities. One could also argue that the uncarved block is referring rather to an unadorned, or a normal piece of wood, one that has not been decorated or ornamented. Through this lens, the uncarved block might be seen as an invitation to turn from the vanity and self-aggrandizement of the world, and to be content with that beauty and usefulness that emanates naturally from a living being, without having to artificially enhance one's appearance. There are a lot of lessons we can learn from the uncarved block, and I would rather you come up with your own interpretation, using your intuition, rather than to lay down a dogmatic interpretation for you to swallow. Therefore, I recommend you contemplate this analogy for yourself. The examples I've offered are merely to be taken as material to get you started. Moving on, we've already talked about the value of hollowness and emptiness, so I won't say much about it just now, but I'd like to draw your attention to the last example, the last part of the passage. Who can wait quietly while the mud settles? Who can remain still until the moment of action? When a pool has been disturbed and become murky, there is almost nothing you can do to clear it up of your own accord. You can't scoop out the silt or force it to separate from the water. The only course of action that is left for you is to patiently wait until the mud settles on its own. Any attempt to take action before this moment results in merely muddying the waters further. This may be interpreted as a lesson that in life, there are many circumstances where our direct involvement or action is not necessary, and can even be detrimental. Certainly there is a time and a place for action, but wu-wei is the principle of being able to follow intuition clearly enough to be able to discern when it is time to act and when it is time to merely allow events to take their course and to trust the results to nature. If you can do this, you will find that the mud will often settle on its own, and that which was previously murky will become clear to you at last. If you can detach yourself from the need to be in the center of everything, you will leave yourself open to seeing things more clearly, because you will be open to seeing and hearing the information that all things give about themselves. The permanent opens the mind. Open mind, open heart. Open heart, magnanimity. Magnanimity, a virtue of queens and kings. A true queen or king lives in accord with nature. To live in accord with nature is to find the Tao. Following the Tao makes death harmless. The fear of death is about the most natural fear in the world. After all, we human beings are physical creatures with bodies and brains that are completely concerned with preserving our physical health. The primary objective of the body and brain is to keep themselves alive, so it makes sense that we would naturally resist the idea of death. However, like many of our body's natural instincts, our aversion to our own mortality causes us a lot of unnecessary discomfort and suffering. At the end of the day, life and death is just another of the many cycles that are part of the world we live in. Actually, there are very few things in our lives that are not subject to this law of cycles. Most things we experience tend to undergo some sort of oscillation or cycle, rather than remaining constant. Rather than one long stretch of unchanging weather conditions and one holiday that repeats over and over, we experience the passage of years through the rhythmic novelty of seasons, each new in relation to the last, but repetitive over the course of a year. We experience cycles in our feelings as well. Rather than experiencing constant excitement or interest about our work, relationships, or hobbies, our enthusiasm toward pretty much everything in our lives tends to wax and wane. We move back and forth between quote-unquote hard times and quote-unquote good times. Our economies are subject to boom and bust cycles that make repetitive patterns throughout history. Likewise, the existence of all things is subject to cycles. Things are born and then eventually die and return to their native states. Almost nothing lasts forever. The only constant, unchanging things in the universe are the Dao, or higher power or order of the universe, and the cycle of change itself. It is a useful exercise to ponder or meditate on this cyclical nature of life and death. All things come from dust and return to dust. Pretty much nothing is exempt. And really, when you think about it, would you even want to live forever? I think for a lot of us, this idea is really kind of exhausting. In preparing to make this video, I came across some people expressing the opinion, I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of suffering. Well, this is also a pretty natural conclusion to come to, and I certainly wouldn't blame anybody for being afraid to suffer. Again, what could be more natural or human? However, I do think that there are a couple of things worth addressing about this viewpoint. In chapter 13, we already discussed that much of our suffering in this life comes from having a death. And that is having a body, as indicated in this passage. What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body which I call myself. If I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me? Having a body causes suffering because pain, hunger, disease, and even things like social rejection cause our brains to feel threatened for survival. Therefore, if suffering is only suffering because of the potential harm to our body, then the fear of death and suffering are really just different sides of the same coin. I do want to also amend what we talked about in the chapter 13 video by saying that suffering comes not only from having a body, but also from experiencing the having of a self. Said a different way, suffering comes from experiencing ourselves as separate from the great oneness of the universe and all things. If we truly experienced ourselves as being one with everything around us, and we were at peace with the eventual decay and expiration of our physical bodies, then theoretically we would have no reason to suffer. Therefore, death is frightening because we see it as an end to the physical body, and an end to the thing we are. Suffering is frightening because of our fear that it will lead to the end of our physical body, or the thing which we call self. Therefore, the fear of suffering is only an extension of our fear of death. When we fear suffering, we fear the experience of being afraid of death, or the end of self, even though we may not be completely conscious of this fear. All suffering is merely the perception of threat to either our physicality or to our self. If we can let go of this illusion of self, our suffering ends, at least theoretically. It's just too bad that there is no end to this fear. It's just too bad that there is no chapter in the Tao Te Ching that covers letting go of the self. Oh wait a second, there is, and we've covered it already, in chapter 13. In order to break this down, I'm going to re-read the excerpt from chapter 13 that we referred to earlier, but I'm going to tack on the rest of the passage with it. What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body which I call myself. If I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me? Therefore, he who would administer the kingdom, honoring it as he honors his own person, may be employed to govern it. And he who would administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be entrusted with it. In the chapter 13 video, we define true love as the ability to take someone else as a part of yourself, to conflate their needs and best interests with your own needs and best interests. Reaching a state where one has this degree of love for all things is the state of oneness, where the illusion of self begins to disappear. Now I do want to clarify a couple of things about this though. First of all, I do want to establish that it is not reasonable to beat yourself up if you are not true to yourself. Which, let's be honest, you probably aren't. I certainly know I'm not. After all, separation is the great illusion of this life. Our perception of separation is literally baked into our culture, our upbringing, even our biology. This means that learning to find this state of oneness, or true love for all things, is an endeavor that will likely last a lifetime or maybe even more. You can't force this to happen either. You have to learn it, and learning takes time. The next thing I want to say is that it is not a matter of whether you are true to yourself or not. The next thing I want to say is that it is not my opinion that the transcending of all suffering is possible in this life. Now things do get a little controversial when we try to decide what a good person is. But let's say for the purpose of this video that if our goal is to attain oneness with all things, and that the process of doing this involves learning disinterested love for all things, and if disinterested love causes a person to speak, think, and act benevolently, which it often does, then we can establish a sort of tentative framework for a good person, if I can be so black and white as to call it that. With this tentative framework in mind, I'll just say this. In my observation, the best people I have known throughout history and in my personal life, that is to say, those people who were and are possessed with the highest degree of disinterested love, did not have lives that were devoid of suffering. Far from it. In fact, a lot of these people went through some of the most difficult life experiences that I can imagine. At the end of the day, in my personal opinion, suffering and mortality are largely inseparable. I don't think that it's possible to live a life without suffering. Actually, I think that it's possible to live a life without suffering. Actually, I don't think it's even desirable. After all, suffering is one of the greatest teachers there is. However, I do think it is possible to gain a perspective through which suffering becomes bearable and reconcilable. By attaining higher degrees of oneness, acceptance, and disinterested love, a person can learn to experience suffering in a different way. They can learn to appreciate it for what it is, and can bear it cheerfully and peacefully. Certainly to such a person, death itself is nothing to be feared whatsoever. The best leaders are those that people hardly know exist. The next best is a leader who is loved and praised. Next comes the one who is feared. The worst one is the leader that is despised. If you don't trust the people, they will become untrustworthy. The best leaders value their words and use them sparingly. When she has accomplished her task, the people say, Amazing! We did it all by ourselves. So, obviously this chapter is all about leadership. The Tao Te Ching offers a lot of these commentaries on leaders and the traits they ought to emulate. Now, when we read passages like this, it can be tempting to assume that they apply to others. For example, when we read passages about good leadership, we often jump straight to thinking things like, Wow, I wish my boss would read this, or Hey, our politicians certainly aren't doing this. However, such thoughts lead to little benefit in our own lives. Since we have no power to control the actions of our bosses and our politicians, we are much better served to ask what we can take from the passage and how we can benefit our own lives. In reality, almost all of us will experience some kind of authority at some time or another. The amount of so-called prestige that goes along with your position is irrelevant. If you are a parent, teacher, older sibling, or even a friend of somebody, this passage applies to you. If you really don't feel like you are in a position of leadership over anybody, this passage is still relevant to you. Because there is still somebody that you govern every day, the person you call yourself. Besides, these days, many of us have an opportunity to participate in the election of our leaders and to make decisions about who is the best leader for us. Therefore, we are well served to be able to distinguish between good and bad leaders so that we can make more informed decisions. Now, I personally love nothing more than a little bit of history. And so as I was contemplating this passage, I was trying to think of some good examples of leaders from each category outlined in the passage. Well, obviously, it's pretty easy to come up with examples from the last three categories. But honestly, I feel like giving examples from those is kind of pointless, because you've probably already thought of several examples by yourself without having to be reminded. When I tried to think of examples of the first category, great leaders, I had a much harder time with it. The reason for this is pretty obvious. After all, according to the passage, one qualification for a great leader is that people take them for granted and barely realize that they are there. By nature, this would mean that great leaders are textbook victims of survivorship bias. I mean, if one shared quality of all great leaders is that people usually don't realize that they are great, then this makes the task of pinning them down pretty hard. So with that in mind, at this point, I suppose we will just stick to describing great leaders in the hypothetical sense for now. Although, if you guys can think of anyone that fits this bill, I would love to hear it. Leaders that perform their duties without concern for what people think about them are pretty uncommon. At the end of the day, we all want to be affirmed. And when serving in a leadership capacity, it can be very tempting to look at this capacity as an opportunity to get that affirmation. I also wonder if it's possible that our fear of being forgotten is an extension of our fear of death, which we talked about yesterday. There is a popular saying out there that a person only truly believes in himself. He only dies when everybody has forgotten him. However, as we talked about yesterday, to the master, death is not a thing to be feared, but rather a natural part of the cycle of nature. When a person practices disinterested love for all those around him or her, there is no need to be worried about dying, because they are not worried about the self. A master doesn't mind if nobody knows what he does, because he wasn't doing it to be noticed. He is happy with his role, and the fact that he is able to provide utility to others by fluidly exercising his own personal talents. His satisfaction with his work in the present moment is enough for him, so he is not worried about the future. If his duties necessitate laying plans for work to be done in the future, he lays his plans, regarding the planning of tomorrow's duties as today's duty, and then puts them aside and returns his attention to the work to be done now. He puts great trust in those around him. He gives second chances when it seems that people don't deserve them. He discerns the talents and passions of those around him, gives them things to do that coincide with these talents, and trusts them to complete them without micromanaging. He doesn't give long speeches for the sake of the future, but he does give long speeches for the sake of hearing himself talk. Often when we lead, we are tempted to spell out every detail for people, but the master does not do this. He uses his words sparingly, giving the people he leads ample opportunity to follow their own intuitions and come to conclusions on their own, understanding that this will enable their learning far better than anything he could say. When he does teach, he says a lot by saying only a little. He chooses his words carefully, and they are the sort of words you could ponder for days. Because he has removed himself from the center of everything, and enabled his people to think and act for themselves, when something is achieved, the people feel a sense of accomplishment and power. They may not even realize his role in bringing the thing to pass at all. But the master is okay with this, because he was never in it for the glory anyway. He can feel a sense of satisfaction for what has been done, and then joyfully move on to the next thing. He can marvel at his own work and appreciate it as objectively as if it were done by somebody else. He is the sort of person that could build the best building in the world, and know that it's the best, and rejoice in it as disinterestedly as he might rejoice in a sunrise, or in a piece of music. He is in the process of detaching from the illusion of self, and finding himself as one with all things, including the people he leads. There are a lot of different opinions when we start to talk about the subject of morality. Some people will invoke this chapter to claim that Daoism is amoral, and not concerned with right or wrong at all. However, in my opinion, this notion is overly simplistic, to the point of missing the mark entirely. Rather than chucking out the idea of morality altogether, this chapter seeks to give a distinction between the way, and cheaper substitutes for living the way. To understand this idea, let's make a hypothetical story about a person we will refer to as Jack. Jack has just lost his wife, and is having a very hard time. Looking for support, Jack decides to call three of his friends. The first friend he calls, Roger, is sympathetic, but says he is too busy at the moment to come and see him. Disappointed, Jack dials up his second friend, Nancy. Nancy, upon hearing his story, snaps into action. She starts a fundraiser for Jack's cause, calls her friends to arrange for meals to Jack's home, and tells her local prayer group all to pray for Jack. Jack is grateful for Nancy's efforts, but at the same time, he feels a little uncomfortable, and not a little unsatisfied. Finally, he starts to call his friend, Steven. But right as he is about to dial the number, the doorbell rings. He goes to answer it, and finds none other than Steven himself on the doorstep. Steven explains that he has been thinking about Jack, and was wondering if he wouldn't like to go on a drive with him to get out of the house for a bit. Jack is very grateful. At the end of the day, this was all he really wanted. Somebody who genuinely cared, and a friend to talk to. The point of this hypothetical story is to illustrate the different ways one can approach morality and kindness. Roger, the first friend, just chose to opt out completely. This is certainly one option we have when encountered with a moral dilemma. Nancy, the second friend, is a bit of an interesting case. Certainly nobody would say that she was unkind or immoral. But in her great efforts to be extra kind and extra moral, she kind of misses the point of what Jack really was in need of. Jack didn't really need somebody to make a big fuss over him. He just wanted somebody to talk to him. Steven was in a perfect position to fulfill this need, because he wasn't blinded by his own moral agenda. He was open to discern, both by intuition, and by asking Jack himself, what was really needed. See, it's not that kindness or morality are bad. It's just that they are only means to an end, not ends in and of themselves. Striving for kindness and morality can be admirable, but it's kind of a cheap substitute for intuition and acting from the heart. Having a goal to act morally is good as far as it goes. Having a goal to act morally is good as far as it goes. But how much better is it to just be the sort of person that will do so naturally, without having to try to do it? This is the higher way of morality. Not to do a certain thing, but to be a certain person. Actually, I think even higher than being a certain person is to turn outwards completely from the self, and to put the focus on others, rather than on what sort of person you are. This is a much higher way than trying to do good things. Intentions of good behavior will never be an adequate substitute for a truly outward-focused lifestyle and perspective. I think a lot of it comes down to the motivation. You can have all kinds of motivations for moral behaviors. Many people try to behave morally in order to impress people around them, to fit into a certain group, or even just to feel okay about themselves. At the end of the day, even though others may benefit from their behavior, the focus still remains on the self. But a person that acts out of oneness with all things will naturally meet the needs of others in exactly the way they need, because this person has taken their needs and interests as part of his or her own needs and interests. This is the higher way, but obviously, this higher way takes a lot more time and work to achieve. Therefore, I don't think we should beat ourselves up if we haven't attained this higher state yet. Sometimes, until we learn oneness, the best we can do is to be kind in whatever way we know how, and I think that's just fine. The main point is just to remember what the ultimate goal is, and to continually make one's way toward that goal. Now, just as good behavior is not a substitute for true harmony and oneness, knowledge and intellectualism are not substitutes for intuition. Intelligence can certainly be a substitute for true harmony and oneness, Intelligence can certainly be a great asset, but alone, it is not enough. This is because knowledge and intuition ultimately depend on the self, or the self's ability to collect information and correctly interpret it. Intuition and softness grant a different perspective, which knowledge alone is not able to attain. Intelligence that is not tempered with patience, softness, humility, and intuition often becomes more of a liability than an asset. Much of the greatest damage that has ever been done to our world and our society has been done by extremely intelligent people. Knowledge often leads to pride, hypocrisy, and useless intellectualism. Intelligence in and of itself is not a virtue. It is neutral, and unless it can be converted into wisdom, it does not profit anyone. In this way, it is a poor substitute for living by the Tao, or the Way. Likewise, family obligations and patriotism are cheap replicas for the Tao, or the Way, which moves a person to true disinterested love without the need for societal rules and obligations to family and country. Obligations which are often done grudgingly, or as the result of social pressure, rather than out of a genuine interest in others. The long and short of all this is that although it is probably better to act rightly for the wrong reasons, it is far better to live by the Tao, which will move a person to right action naturally and independently of social rules. But what do you guys think? Do you think there is an element of fake it till you make it in terms of moral actions? Forget about knowledge and wisdom, and people will be a hundred times better off. Throw away charity and righteousness, and people will return to brotherly love. Throw away profit and greed, and there won't be any thieves. These three are superficial and aren't enough to keep us at the center of the circle. So we must also Embrace simplicity Put others first Desire little This chapter is largely a continuation of chapter 18. One thing to remember is that the original text of the Tao Te Ching probably wasn't divided into chapters, so it can be helpful to look at chapters 18 and 19 as one whole. Since we have already covered 18 pretty extensively, and since 19 goes pretty much along the same lines, we'll keep this video a bit shorter and just take a minute to reiterate some of the same themes. Knowledge alone often becomes a pitfall to those who use it. Trying to be kind or good for the wrong reasons is not as beneficial as adopting a true, outward-focused perspective, where we see others' needs clearly and make them equal with our own. Constantly pursuing profit and gain leads to inequality and resentment, which leads to pride, selfishness, and crime. If we can learn to cast off these attitudes and follow our intuition, we can be open to harmony with the higher order of the universe, which changes us, instead of just changing our behavior. Trying to act rightly will only lead to superficial changes. In order to truly act rightly, we need to become changed by coming into harmony with a force higher and greater than ourselves. Then we will act rightly not because we're trying hard to, but as a natural result of coming more in harmony with Tao, and by so doing, becoming one with all things. Be done with knowing and your worries will disappear. How much difference is there between yes and no? How much distinction between good and evil? Fearing what others fear? Admiring what they admire? Nonsense. Conventional people are jolly and reckless, feasting on worldly things and carrying on as though every day were the beginning of spring. I alone remain uncommitted, like an infant who hasn't yet smiled. Lost, quietly drifting, unattached to ideas and places and things. Conventional people hoard more than they need, but I possess nothing at all. Know nothing at all. Understand nothing at all. They are bright, I am dark. They are sharp, I am dull. Like the sea, I am calm and indifferent. Like the wind, I have no particular direction. Everyone else takes his place and does his job. I alone remain wild and natural and free. I am different from others. My sustenance comes directly from the mother. Adopting a strict set of moral principles will almost always lead you to stand out from others. This is true not only of Taoism, but of many other philosophies, religions, and schools of thought. Standing out is uncomfortable, because we naturally feel unsafe when our connection with others is threatened. But if we choose to follow the path of Taoism, Lao-tzu warns that we will inevitably find ourselves apart from others. There are many reasons for this. Often, people adopt their opinions not from thoughtful study, but from the prevailing opinions of the day and accepting them as fact. Of course, this is only natural, because joining other people in their opinions affords us a sense of safety and belonging to the group. But it's important to understand that an opinion is not necessarily correct just because it is widely accepted, or just because it is pleasant to listen to. When a person has dedicated themselves to an honest search for truth, their quest will inevitably lead them contrary to popular opinion from time to time. Recently in the Discord, we had a really interesting discussion where somebody brought up a short video that they had seen. In this video, a person said that in Taoism, the standard is not to resist anything and to just go with whatever is happening. Another person in the video then asked the first person if that means that he should not resist the Nazis if they were taking over his country, to which the first person had no good answer. In the group, we discussed this video and some of the flawed assumptions about Taoism that were at play in what was being said. One member of the Discord brought up an excellent point, by saying that Taoism is not a religion, but rather a practice of self-discipline. One member of the Discord brought up an excellent point, by saying that Taoism is not a religion, but rather a practice of self-discipline. The other member of the Discord brought up an excellent point, by saying that Taoism is concerned with going along with the flow of the Tao, not necessarily the flow of other people. I thought that this was very well said. Often we become confused with this concept of going with the flow. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with this phrase, but when we use it to describe Taoism, we run the risk of mis-understanding its principles. Taoism, of course, does not teach us to go with all flows, it teaches us to follow the Tao. Five minutes mental examination of this idea of going with all flows exposes it for the fallacy that it is. that it is. If going with the flow truly meant that we were supposed to go along with what everybody around us is doing, then all other principles of Taoism are false, because I guarantee you that most people are not adhering to them. In addition to the principle of going with the flow, Taoism teaches mastery of desires, patience, softness, flexibility, other-centeredness, responsiveness to intuition, all of which are completely contrary to the attitudes of the world at large. If Taoism means that we go along with other people in all things, then Taoism is self-defeating. There are a million different currents from a million different forces at play in our universe, and we can choose to follow any one of them. Taoism is not the philosophy of following whichever current happens to catch you at any particular time. It is the philosophy of choosing one very particular current over all others, and following wherever it leads. When we do this, we are pretty much guaranteed to find ourselves being set apart from other people. Because of this, there will be times when we feel like everyone around us is happy, and we alone are left out and miserable. This is the cost of following other people's ideas and beliefs. If we follow other people's ideas and beliefs, we are not following a path like that of the Tao. We choose to give up some things in favor of other things. Although we may have given up the chance to be like everyone else, we have given it up in favor of the guidance and companionship of the Tao. And let me tell you, that's a pretty darn good trade. A master stays focused on Tao. Nothing else. Just Tao. But you can't pin Tao down. You can't even see it. How are you supposed to focus on something like that? Just remember what Lao Tzu said. The universe began as a void. The void fills with images. Images lead to the creation of objects, and every object has Tao at its core. That's the way it's been ever since the world began. How can I be so sure? I just know. Alright, well, thanks for humoring me there. For this chapter, I decided to pull out one of my personal favorite translations, the Rob Hogan translation. I love this translation not because it's especially accurate or precise, but mostly because I find its no-nonsense, cowboyish tone entertaining. With this chapter, however, I felt comfortable with whipping out this translation, because I feel that it actually gets the overall idea of the chapter pretty well. This chapter is another one of these sort of Tao poems we see scattered throughout the text. As with all of them, though, there are concrete things we can learn hidden amongst all the prose. Here, we are dealing with creation theory, and the underlying theory of Taoism. The Taoist Taoism is a theory of Taoism, and the Taoist Taoism is the underlying structure of the universe. Well, of course, as soon as we start dealing with topics like these, we are treading out of the realm of scientific verifiability, just as we would have been doing in Lao Tzu's day. In the time of Lao Tzu, there was much about the natural world in which people lived which was not understood. Weather, seasons, animal behavior, evolution, the night sky, these concepts must have seemed as obscure and unfathomable as the bottom of the ocean. Today, thanks to science, we have some degree of understanding about how some of these things work. However, an understanding of the very nature of the world is not enough to explain the whole thing. The understanding of the very base of it, the nature of the universe itself, what holds it all together, what causes it to all go on to the most basic levels, still eludes us. We can't explain it with science. Really, we can't explain it at all, because the thing that lies at the heart of all of it predates any words or concepts that we might try to use to describe it. This thing is the underlying heartbeat of the universe, the way. Some choose to disregard that which is unseen, but others know better. How? They just know. Other translations render the last line as, I look inside myself, and see. Those who choose not to disregard intuition gain another sense that allows them to detect more than what is discernible with the other five senses. They can feel the presence of underlying truths that cannot be proved using scientific observation. Learning to hear and follow this intuition is at the heart of wu-wei, the heart of following the Tao. If you want to become whole, first let yourself become broken. If you want to become straight, first let yourself become twisted. If you want to become full, first let yourself become empty. If you want to become new, first let yourself become old. Those whose desires are few, get them. Those whose desires are great, go astray. For this reason, the Master embraces the Tao, as an example for the world to follow. Because she isn't self-centered, people can see the light in her. Because she does not boast of herself, she becomes a shining example. Because she does not glorify herself, she becomes a person of merit. Because she wants nothing from the world, the world cannot overcome her. When the ancient masters said, if you want to become whole, then first let yourself become broken, they weren't using empty words. All who do this will be made complete. Desires are part of our basic biology. Our brains are literally wired to desire things, and it's a good thing too. Because these mechanisms keep us alive by pushing us to acquire what is needed for our daily survival. However, desires can get out of hand, and usually they do. Most of us live in a state of being constantly dominated by our desires. Chapter 22 of the Tao Te Ching offers advice on how to avoid this. The recipe is simple. If you really want something, first allow yourself to be reconciled with its opposite. Surrender yourself to the possibility of getting the exact opposite of whatever it is that you want. This attitude has made it possible to get rid of the desire to be completely free. This attitude has made it possible to get rid of the desire to be completely free. This attitude has many benefits. First of all, it leads to increased peace of mind. We are much more content when we adapt to circumstances that lay out of our control rather than worrying about them or trying to force them to be something that they are not. Another benefit is that doing this pulls our minds out of the future, where we are hoping something will happen or not happen, and sets us firmly in the present, where all peace, joy, and love is. You cannot experience joy while being focused on the future. You can experience fear, anticipation, or greed, but not joy. You can experience fear, anticipation, or greed, but not joy. You can experience fear, anticipation, or greed, but not joy. You can experience fear, anticipation, or greed, but not joy. Joy is a feeling that only happens in the present. In addition, when we allow ourselves to experience the opposite of what we think we want, we often learn a lot about what we really want. Opposition is at the heart of the universe itself, and is present in everything we do and experience. Our minds even require opposition in order to really wrap our heads around concepts. Think about it. Would you really understand what a good friend was if you had never experienced a bad one? Would you even have a concept of what darkness was if you had never seen light? Would you even have a concept of what darkness was if you had never seen light? Would you enjoy one of the mostaller and most beautiful things in the universe? Would you enjoy a great relationship with the person who you love? Is it possible to go with your will when you experience adversity, or do you absolutely love the seen light? Opposition gives us clarity and understanding. We never really understand anything until we first understand its opposite. The same goes for our desires. We often only realize what we really want when we are in the depths of that which we don't want. I hear stories all the time about friends or acquaintances going through several years of a major in college, only to find out near the end that they actually hate the subject once they get into an internship or some real on-the-job experience. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, about 80% of college students will change their major at least once, and on average, students will change their major three times or more. Why is this? Because sometimes you think you like something until you realize that you don't. Sometimes you think you don't like something until you realize that you do. In short, we come to know what we want by coming to know what we don't want. This is the point of opposition, to give us an understanding of things that we could just not attain to without the understanding of their opposites. Therefore, when we experience opposition in our lives, we can't just say, I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. We shouldn't think that something has gone wrong. It hasn't. It's part of the plan. Now, I think there's something we should understand about the line, those whose desires are few get them, and those whose desires are great go astray. I don't think that we should take this line to mean that we are entitled to any particular desire because we only have a few desires. Doing this would be an example of the all-I-want state of mind. For example, all I want is 10 minutes of peace and quiet, or all I want is a half-decent cup of coffee. Is that so hard? The all-I-want state of mind is dangerous, because it's not just about the desire, it's about the desire itself. It's about the desire itself. It puts us in a place of entitlement and gratifies our selfishness. It tempts us to give a pass to our obstinacy to get what we want, simply because we have convinced ourselves that what we want is simple or easy to acquire. The reality, of course, is that in this world, pretty much all desires are subject to laws of temporality, which means that pretty much all desires have the potential to be denied, even simple ones. You cannot force the universe to give you what you want by minimizing what you want, as if desires were purchased with some sort of karmic currency that you could budget and save and eventually save. You cannot force the universe to give you what you want, as if desires were purchased with some sort of karmic currency that you could spend on something. That is not how things work, at least in this world. Therefore, we are much better off letting go of our arbitrary claims on the universe, and staying rooted in the simplicity and contentment of the present moment. When the text says, those whose desires are great go astray, I don't think we should look at this simply in terms of quantity, but rather on the quality of our desires. How do we desire things? Are we the masters of our desires, or do they master us? Are they able to control our thoughts in idle moments, or our moods when they do and don't happen? Are they able to control our thoughts in idle moments, or our moods when they do and don't happen? At the end of the day, I think a pretty good litmus test for the quality of a desire is whether or not it allows you to stay focused in the present, or if you find yourself constantly being drawn away from the present by thoughts, hopes, or fears about the future, and what it will hold for this particular desire. If you can spend several hours working towards a desire or goal, and then set it aside and attend to your other present duties and experiences without being drawn back into constant thoughts about that desire, then I think you're on the right track. If you find yourself constantly thinking about that desire, though, and if it has the power to change your attitude or mind based on whether it's working out or not, I think it might be time for you to do some internal work on this desire. Reconcile and surrender to the possibility of this desire never working out. Imagine what that would feel like. Imagine what you would do if that opportunity was gone forever. Would you survive? Would you be able to eventually move on? Chances are that if you really think about it, you probably would. Perhaps it would take some time. Perhaps a long time. But eventually, you could get over it. If we learn to practice this kind of mastery over desire, we will find ourselves more open to intuition, more at peace, and more in harmony with the Tao. To talk little is natural. High winds do not last all morning. Heavy rain does not last all day. Why is this? Heaven and earth. If heaven and earth cannot make things eternal, how is it possible for man? He who follows the Tao is at one with the Tao. He who is virtuous is at one with the Tao. He who is virtuous is at one with the Tao. He who is in the way is at one with the Tao. He who is in the way is at one with the Tao. He who loses the way is lost. When you are at one with the Tao, the Tao welcomes you. When you are at one with virtue, the virtue is always there. When you are at one with loss, the loss is experienced willingly. He who does not trust enough will not be trusted. Chapter 23 of the Tao Te Ching says an awful lot with just a few lines, from the benefits of talking less, to virtue, to becoming one with loss. And although I wish I had time to break down the whole chapter, I'm just going to focus on one theme for today, the art of giving up everything. To get an idea of what is meant by this, let's take a second and break down something that is said in the last part of the chapter. When you are at one with loss, the loss is experienced willingly. This part can be easy to skip over with everything else that is being said in the chapter, but if we miss this, we miss what is in my opinion one of the real gems of what is being said. Throughout the rest of the chapter, we will be able to see that the Tao is at one with the Tao, which is an obvious advantage, and then we are told to be one with virtue, which is also good, but then Lao Tzu talks about being one with loss. Now, this is one of those parts of the Tao Te Ching that will read a little bit differently depending on whose translation you're using. Some translations interpret this part in a way where becoming one with loss is a bad thing, but some translations show it as a good thing. This is why it is helpful to read multiple translations of the Tao Te Ching side by side. This is also why I do not want to be one with the Tao Te Ching, because it is the same thing. If I were to use this part again, I would have to read the Tao Te Ching one by one. The Tao Te Ching is one of the most important parts of the Tao Te Ching. This is why I want to be one with the Tao Te Ching. The Tao Te Ching is one of the most important parts of the Tao Te Ching. This is also why I do not recommend any one translation as the best one, because I find that different translations seem to call to me depending on which chapter I'm reading. Often, I will like how one translation renders one chapter, but for another chapter I will prefer a different translation. As far as becoming one with loss, I found one translation that rendered this line as, those who are one with deprivation are deprived of deprivation. I found this really interesting. That's a statement you can really chew on for a bit. To me, it seemed to teach a truth that I have been taught in many areas of my life. That our willingness to give up that which we want often renders the actual giving up of that thing unnecessary, while our stubborn unwillingness to give up that same thing is often met with demands to give up even more of it. The person who obstinately withholds things from the universe is usually required to give up more and more. The person who willingly offers all that he or she has is often allowed to keep it, because he or she understands that it's not really theirs anyway. This is true of all the Tao Te Ching that I have read, but I don't think it's true of all the other Tao Te Ching. This is true of all the Tao Te Ching that I have read, but I don't think it's true of all the other Tao Te Ching. This is true of all the Tao Te Ching. This is true of our time, money, possessions, relationships, our comfort, our happiness, really anything that we might call ours. The truth of the matter is that none of these things that we call ours are really ours at all. Everything we have has been given to us, and could be taken away at any time, and we'd be completely powerless to prevent it. The things which we make with our hands are only possible because we were given the materials to make them by the earth. When we have been long gone, these things will return back to the elements that gave them birth. To assert that we can lay some kind of ownership to materials, land, or time that was here before we were, will exist long after we are gone, and of which we are powerless to create or destroy even the tiniest particle must sound frankly hilarious to the Tao's perspective. If you question this notion for even a minute, it becomes apparent how silly it is. Nothing that we have is ours. Everything we use or work with has been borrowed to us as a temporary stewardship and will be taken from us at some point. Therefore, to desperately hold onto things that were never ours in the first place is complete nonsense. This is true of all the Tao Te Ching that I have read, but I don't think it's true of all the other Tao Te Ching. This is true of all the Tao Te Ching that I have written, and could be taken away at any time, and we'd be completely lost in the process. The universe will not rest until it has taught us differently. Therefore, the things which we hold onto are the things which we are most often required to give up. The more we try to protect our time, the more demands will be made on it. The more desperately we hoard our money, the more it will start to slip through our fingers. I'm not advocating that we all go out tomorrow and get rid of all of our possessions, but I am advocating that we come to live in a state of mind where we could do this if we were called upon to do so. Becoming one with loss means to resign yourself completely, to lose everything, and to make peace with it. This is a philosophy which demands a bit more than just try to meditate every so often. But any philosophy which demanded no more than occasional meditation would not be able to deliver the peace that comes from being truly one with all things. The only way to attain this peace is to become one with the Tao, the way, the higher force of the universe. And to do this, we need to become one with loss. The most miserable people I think I have ever met were those who were obsessed with defending the little comforts and niceties that they felt were their rights and their just desserts. These people were in a state of mind that can only lead to misery, because as soon as you make these sort of claims, the universe will begin to harass you on all sides, making demands that increasingly agitate these claims until you either go insane or give them up completely. If this is the case, aren't we so much better off just to give them up from the start? If we examine ourselves and find ourselves holding on to ownership or claims on anything, we can start the work of surrendering these things to the universe one by one, over and over again if need be, until we are truly at one with loss, so that we can be truly at one with Tao. To followers of the Tao, such actions are excessive, like eating too much. They are disliked by all things, and therefore followers of the Tao do not seek refuge in them. The Tao Te Ching Most religions and philosophies since ancient times have at least in some way cautioned against the vice of hubris or self-aggrandizement. The Tao Te Ching is certainly no different, and chapter 24 gives some specific instructions to this end. We are advised not to try to stand higher than the sun, but to stand higher than the sun, and to stand higher than the sun, but to stand higher than others, not to race to get ahead of others only to find that we cannot maintain the pace. We should not make extravagant displays of wisdom or talent. We should not seek to be praised by others. We should question our own conclusions and opinions as much as or more than we question those of others. In observing each of these behaviors that Lao Tzu advises against, one can notice a possible link between all of them. They all have to do with taking more care for how we appear outwardly than how we exist inwardly. I'm not saying that this is the only common link between these examples. I'm just saying that the Tao Te Ching is a very common link between the Tao Te Ching and the Tao Te Ching. It is a very common link between the Tao Te Ching and the Tao Te Ching. But perhaps it is worth noting. All throughout the Tao Te Ching, we are advised to take care of our inner world, to learn to adopt a feeling of quietness and openness. When we attain to this state, I think we will usually feel instinctively how undesirable each of these behaviors are, and we will tend to not fall into them as easily. However, we should also remember that these behaviors, while undesirable, catch each of us once in a while, and none of us are really perfect at avoiding them, just as probably none of us has ever lived without overdoing them. These things happen, and we have certainly done them ourselves, so there is not much point in judging others when we observe them falling into the same traps that we have fallen into. I'm sure that each of us has experienced the urge to overeat at some point or another. It's a very difficult urge to master because it plays on our very instincts for survival. Instincts to overeat actually served our ancestors during times when food was scarce, because nutrients obtained during times of plenty could be stored and utilized later during times of famine.

If you have any questions, please leave a comment below. I'm sure you will find this video helpful and will be able to help others. For those of you who have steady access to a constant supply of food, probably most of us have never really experienced what it's like to not know if you'll be able to get another meal. For us, the times of real famines do not come, but our instincts to gorge remain. Therefore, in order to keep our bodies healthy, we must learn to master these instincts, which are well-intentioned from an evolutionary standpoint, but that no longer serve us. The need for love and appreciation is not evil anymore than the need to eat is evil. The question is how we go about meeting this need, and whether we allow the associated urges to control us. There are always healthy and unhealthy ways of trying to meet needs, and it's up to us to make conscious decisions about which methods we will pursue. But remember, at the end of the day, none of us is perfect in doing this, and we should try to give others the patience and understanding that we will certainly at some point require from them. The Tao Making an effort to give it a name, I call it the Great. Great, it passes on in constant flow. Passing on, it becomes remote. Having become remote, it returns. Therefore, the Tao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the Sage King is also great. In the universe, there are four that are great, and the Sage King is one of them. Man takes his law from the Earth, Earth takes its law from Heaven, Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The Tao is being what it is. If you were to ask me to say a word that is unpopular in today's culture, one that jumps to mind is the concept of authority. We often don't like the idea of being governed by something, especially something that we can't see. This attitude may be part of the reason why some people find it hard to believe in a higher power, such as a god or the Tao. In this chapter of the Tao Te Ching, Lao Tzu explains that there are hierarchies of power, both on Earth and in the greater scope of the universe. We often resist the idea of authority, thinking we want to carve our own paths, but while it is definitely important to use our own power of choice, we also need to realize that there are powers greater than us that do govern us to some degree. Being able to acknowledge powers greater than yourself does not diminish your own personal power of choice. Being able to do this is a part of wisdom. Lao Tzu tells us in Chapter 8 that we should seek to emulate water which flows automatically to the low places, rather than trying to push itself above the crowd. The Sage understands that there are powers greater than us and that this power of choice is an open choice. Sages write that the power of choice is the tune of the heart and the body. Sages say that the power of choice is taking it from our hearts, and that our heart is gave into our hearts, understands that there are powers greater than him or herself, both among people and among the heavens, and he or she does not try to challenge that authority. He understands that while not all leaders use their power benevolently, having no leader at all would lead to anarchy and chaos. He understands that having to sometimes deal with leaders he disagrees with is part of having a leader at all. I'm not saying that we should bow to tyrants or enable bad leaders to usurp power, but we also shouldn't rebel against authority just because it's authority. There are bad leaders, but there are also good leaders, and even in-between leaders. It is not reasonable to expect our leaders to be perfect, and even though they will inevitably make mistakes, we should do our best to be subject to the laws we live under. I'm saying this under the assumption that most of my viewers do not live in countries ruled by autocratic dictators. In democratic countries, there are mechanisms built in for people to make their opinions known in ways that do not cause harm to others. Respectful discourse will do far more good than slander, bigotry, and hateful criticism of those who disagree with us. Now, although we accept that we live under leaders that are human and fallible, we also live under the governance of a force that is not fallible. The higher power of the universe, which Taoists call Tao, governs all that there is. Some do not believe in such a higher power, and this is probably understandable, since it is not discernible to the regular senses. However, at the same time, we believe in all sorts of things that we have never seen or experienced. For example, you have probably never met the president or leader of your country, but most likely this does not prevent you from believing they exist, and this is one of the laws they help to represent. However, with the Tao, we have an advantage even over this. Most of us will probably never have any sort of personal encounter with the leaders of our country, but to each of us the opportunity exists to have personal encounters with the Tao. By following the way, we see the way in action. By taking time for quiet contemplation, we begin to feel its influence through our feelings and our intuition. Honest seekers of this kind of personal connection with higher power will always be able to find it, and will find their lives and their selves becoming enriched beyond what they are. The Tao of Lightness Gravity is the root of lightness. Stillness, the ruler of movement. Therefore, a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far from his baggage wagons. Although he may have brilliant prospects to look at, he quietly remains in his proper place, indifferent to them. How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly before the kingdom? If he do act lightly, he has lost his root of gravity. If he persists, he will lose his root of gravity. If he persists, he will lose his root of gravity. If he recedes to active movement, he will lose his throne. One of the main principles of Taoism that we read a lot about is cultivating stillness of mind, heart, and body. This stillness often makes a stark contrast with the constant hustle and bustle of the world around us. For a Taoist, though, stillness does not mean inaction. The first line of chapter 26 of the Tao Te Ching tells us that stillness is the ruler of movement. For a Taoist, the cultivation of inner quiet is not for the sake of never doing anything. Rather, the master understands that stillness is the root of action in its purest and most effortless form. Stillness forms the basis for being able to act in the most effortless and efficacious way. Looking at chapter 26, I want to quickly draw your attention to the third line. Therefore, a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far from his baggage wagons. This line has quite a variation in translations when you look at different sources, and I think this leads to a decent amount of confusion. The first line of chapter 26 of the Tao Te Ching tells us that stillness is the ruler of movement. Therefore, a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far from his baggage wagons. Therefore, a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far from his baggage wagons. This leads to a decent amount of confusion. I have even seen this line translated as, Thus the master travels all day without leaving home. After looking at quite a number of different translations, though, the most common rendering seems to be this idea of traveling all day without leaving the baggage carts. Personally, however, I don't think that Lao Tzu was just giving us travel advice. Another translation in particular that seemed to shed some light on this part for me was one that renders the line as, Wherefore, while the sage proceeds the whole day according to Tao, he departs from either calmness or gravity. When we look at the other translations through this line, a new meaning begins to emerge, one that actually seems to kind of tie all these other meanings together. To my eyes, it seems like Lao Tzu is using the idea of traveling, but staying close to the baggage carts, as a metaphor. It feels to me like he uses this analogy to invoke an image of a person going about, traveling, living his or her life, but while doing so, remaining close to their center. In other words, a sage can go about traveling and taking care of whatever duties are required to do that. But, in reality, he or she is still in a state of quietness, openness, and softness, or a meditative-like state. This state leaves one open to feeling intuition, observing the world as it is, and not forcing themselves upon it, or becoming overly caught up in its many distractions. If you've ever traveled somewhere that you've really liked, you may be able to relate to what I'm about to say here. I was super lucky as a child in that I got a lot of opportunities to travel around my native country of the United States. My parents were really smart about figuring out ways to make a living, and I was able to do that. I was able to take a lot of family vacations into errands my dad could run for his work. And around once a year, they would turn one of these errands into a trip where we could go somewhere where we had never been. Throughout our travels, I remember several occasions of being in places where I was almost overwhelmed with things to look at, listen to, and experience. One of these for me was the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, DC. I remember running around from thing to thing, anxious to inhale the next bit of novelty. Maybe you've experienced something similar at an amusement park or a museum as a child. I remember going to places where there are so many things to grab and hold your attention. However, as we travel through life, we find this happening on a sort of broad, general scale. And in this case, it can start to become a bit of a problem. There are a million and one things to get distracted by in our lives. News articles and programs, social media, long checklists of to-dos that aren't really that important in the big picture. These things can suck us right in if we're not careful. They can start to take over our lives by influencing our moods, dominating our thought lives, and crowding out the things that matter. If we're not careful, we can lose ourselves in the many distractions that present themselves to us. When this happens, we become less wise and less in control of ourselves. We start to equate these things with real life, while passing over the things that really do matter. Real life, whatever that is, isn't found in headlines, reels, or errands. Real life is found when we peel the distractions off our eyes and look and see what is in front of us. I like to call this process hitting the windshield wipers, because it reminds me of the moment when the wipers hit for the first time in a week or two, and have this moment of realizing how murky your windshield really was, and how much clearer you can see now that you've cleaned it. Often, we don't realize how distracted we are until we really let go of the distractions. I think this is one reason why it feels so good to meditate. If you have any experience with meditation, as many of you likely do, you will have an idea of what I mean. Often, after a really good meditation, you just get this feeling of freshness and lightness, like taking a breath of fresh air. Meditation is an excellent way of teaching our bodies and minds to be quiet and centered. However, when we think about meditation, a lot of times we get the idea that it's just something we do for 15 minutes a day. However, meditation is much more than that. These daily 15 minute sessions, or however long you do them, are not really supposed to be sessions at all in my opinion. At least not in the sense of being an activity that starts and ends within the parameters of the session, and then is put aside for the rest of the day. Part of the point of these meditation sessions is to train our minds and bodies to attain to a state of softness, openness, and quietness that can eventually permit us to be more focused on our own lives. Meditation is a very important part of our daily life, and it's a very important part of our life. Meditation is a very important part of our life. Meditation is a very important part of our life. Meditation is a very important part of our life. Meditation is a very important part of our life. Meditation is a very important part of our life.

A good speaker makes no slips. A good reckoner needs no tally. A good door needs no lock, yet no one can open it. Good binding requires no knots, yet no one can loosen it. Therefore, the sage takes care of all men and abandons no one. He takes care of all things and abandons nothing. This is called following the light. What is a good man? A teacher of a bad man. What is a bad man? A good man's charge. If the teacher is not respected and the student not cared for, confusion will arise, however clever one is. This is the crux of mystery. Teaching and learning are very important parts of life. All throughout our lives, we will find ourselves filling the roles of both teacher and student. Chapter 27 of the Bible says, The first few lines of the chapter can seem a little confusing without the context of the rest of the chapter. It's not immediately clear that we're talking about teaching and learning, and without understanding this, it can feel like these first lines are just a handful of useless paradoxes. However, when we look at the first few lines of the chapter in the context of the whole chapter, we begin to see the meaning coming out of the woodwork. These first few lines about speakers that don't speak the truth, don't stutter, and bookkeepers that don't need tallies, are descriptions of masters doing their respective tasks in ways that boggle the minds of those who do not possess their same skill. To the layman, a person that has truly mastered a particular skill seems to perform their task with an almost magical sense of ease and perfection. They astound others by performing their skills in ways that seem impossible if you don't possess the experience to understand what is being done. While the novice often favors extravagant bangs, flashes, and tricks to try to impress those around him, the true master can often be identified by the unassuming simplicity with which they perform their task, and yet the results far outstrip those of everyone else. Showiness is not a sign of mastery. A master is able to boil down a task to its absolute essentials, and then perfect each of these essentials to the point where they are flawless and automatic. As a person achieves mastery in his or her respective field, it then becomes their privilege and perhaps their obligation to pass this knowledge onward so that others may benefit from and improve upon it. A master should not approach this task as an opportunity to gratify themselves, but rather as a chance to help and care for others. The rest of the chapter offers advice on this matter. Now, as we get into that, let's just quickly examine the distinctions of good and bad used in this section. It does seem a little bit crass of us to just call all those who are learned good and all those who are unlearned bad. However, the Chinese word that is rendered here as good isn't really an exact translation. The word in Chinese is shun, which is used to denote skill or aptitude. The word that is here translated as bad is just the negative version of shun, denoting a lack of skill or aptitude. So we're not really talking about good people or bad people in a moral sense. We're just referring to those who are skilled, the teachers, and those who are not, the students. Notice here the importance that is put on the teacher-student relationship. Both parties have a responsibility and obligation to each other in order to achieve optimal learning. Of the student is required focus, determination to learn, and deference and respect for the teacher. This respect will allow the student to remain open to the instruction of the teacher and will allow the teacher to expound freely. Of the teacher is required patience, kindness, and love for the student. This will help the student to feel safe and comfortable in the learning environment, and will guide the teacher's teaching process to conform to the student's needs. If these obligations are disregarded, the learning process will suffer greatly, no matter how talented the teacher or the student. So since each of us finds ourselves in either the teaching or the learning role, or sometimes both, all throughout our lives, we would do well to take this timeless advice to heart, so that we can both experience teaching and learning in their most efficacious and enjoyable states. Know the masculine, but keep to the feminine, and become a watershed to the world. If you embrace the world, the Tao will never leave you, and you become as a little child. Know the white, yet keep to the black. Be a model for the world. If you are a model for the world, the Tao inside you will strengthen. And you will return whole to your eternal beginning. Know the honorable, but do not shun the disgraced, embracing the world as it is. If you embrace the world with compassion, then your virtue will return you to the uncarved block. The block of wood is carved into utensils by carving void into the wood. The master uses the utensils, yet prefers to keep to the block, because of its limitless possibilities. Great works do not involve discarding substance. The master uses the utensils, yet prefers to keep to the block, because of its limitless possibilities. The master uses the utensils, yet prefers to keep to the block, because of its limitless possibilities. For today's video, I'd like to do something a little bit different. Usually, these videos take the rough format of me reading out the chapter, and then explaining my interpretation of it for about five minutes. But today, we're going to do something a bit different. For today's chapter, I'm going to point out a few specific parts of the text, and ask some questions about them. And then, I'm going to ask you guys to try to answer them for yourselves. If you need some help, I will link some of the videos where we discuss these topics, just to give you some background on how to do it. Just to give you some background, if you would like it. You can find the links to these videos both in cards you can click at the upper right hand corner of the video, and in the description. While I do enjoy explaining my take on the Tao Te Ching to you guys, and while the algorithm probably favors my doing that, I think it's more beneficial for you guys to get really good at hearing the opinions of others, pondering them on your own, and then following intuition to come to your own conclusions. I don't expect this video will do terribly well as far as numbers go, but I'm fine with that. Because I really want you guys to have a chance to put some of this stuff to evidence. So with that in mind, I'll give you the questions. 5. Why do you think Lao Tzu liked to use the analogy of the Uncarved Block? Go ahead and really ponder each of these questions for yourself. I recommend taking as much time as you need for this exercise, even if you kind of just chew on these questions throughout the course of your day. If you're in the Discord, I would love for you to come by the discussion thread for Chapter 28 and put your answers in there, if you would like to. If you aren't in the Discord, feel free to join, or leave your answers in the comments. Do you like the chapter 28? Do you like the chapter 28? Do you like the chapter 28? Do you want to rule the world and control it? I don't think it can ever be done. The world is a sacred vessel, and it cannot be controlled. You will only make it worse if you try. It may slip through your fingers and disappear. Some are meant to lead, and others are meant to follow. Some must always strain, and others have an easy time. Some are naturally big and strong, and others will always be small. Some will be protected and nurtured, and others will meet with destruction. The Master accepts things as they are. The Master accepts things as they are. And out of compassion, avoids extravagance, excesses, and the extremes. We live in a world where activism is sexy. Everybody has something to say about how the world is working, and how it should be working, and what we need to do to get it there. And before I get too far ahead of myself, I am contractually obligated to clarify that I am not here to call out any particular political group, belief system, ideology, or the people that adhere to them. I am also not saying that people are bad or evil for wanting to improve the world. Of course that's not the case. However, I also don't think, and I think Lao Tzu agrees with me, that all attempts at bettering the world end up doing as much good as we hope they will. Of course it's a good desire to do good in the world. We go wrong, however, when we make the assumption that we will do this by changing other people or outside circumstances. This is the wrong way to go about trying to do good, and it will always lead to negative results. See, the problem is that attempts to do good in the world by changing other things, or other people, operate on an incorrect assumption. This incorrect assumption is the assumption that those other people, or those other things that are out there, are the problem. But this is not the case. These other things and other people are not the problem. I am the problem. You are the problem. The most important influence we have on changing the world is changing ourselves. Of course, often the things that we think need changing in the world do not need changing at all. Our human lives cover less than the tiniest sliver of the life span. We see only what presents itself to our eyes. And frankly, we manage to miss even most of that. Therefore, our perspectives are critically limited to the point that our efforts to change things around us often only create more problems. Certainly it is good to try and do good in the world. But this doesn't mean that we need to change everything that seems to us to be wrong. This is where our ability to put aside self-will and listen to our intuition comes in. Some things require our action, and others do not. We are not the only ones who are not. We are the only ones who are not. We are the only ones who are not. Others do not. Some circumstances that we mistake for disasters end up having positive results. We should not be too quick to jump to conclusions about what is good and what is bad. Another problem with our desire to change things is our tendency to overlook the things that we have the greatest ability to change. For example, I may be seriously concerned about wars or unrest in other states or countries, and so I may attempt to start a society or a fundraiser or post on social media to raise awareness. But all of these things ultimately would be attempts by myself to change a situation far away from me. Which frankly, I know very little about, compared to those who are actually there experiencing it. No matter how much I've read or learned about situations I am not directly involved in, my understanding of them will never be as great as if I were actually experiencing them. And therefore, my ability to propose solutions to these problems is greatly diminished. We often would do much better to focus on the good we can do within our own spheres of influence. Our well-intentioned efforts for world change so often shipwreck on the fatal flaw that almost all humans share, the horror and neglect of the obvious. Because of this flaw, we often overlook the most basic and obvious duties in favor of advanced, far-reaching, and supposedly spiritual or humanitarian ones. Should I be so eager to get involved in a conflict halfway across the world, if at the same time I'm utterly failing to address conflict in my own home? All the care and concern in the world for mystery people that we have never met becomes pretty hollow if at the same time we gossip about our neighbors, feud with our parents, or neglect the emotional needs of our family members. We tend to think of changing the world as an outside-in job, but it's not. It's an inside-out job. The most important duty we have if we want to improve the world is to improve ourselves. As we do this, our goodness will spread to our inner circles, to our families, to our communities, our countries, and from there, to the entire world. But importantly, this is not a campaign of any organized group of people or politicians. This is a movement of billions of individuals, each taking responsibility for themselves and their own personal virtue. This is the only way to create real, lasting change. One author put it this way, The answer to the question, what is wrong, is or should be, I am wrong. Until a man can give that answer, his idealism is only a hobby. If we put first things first and focus on making sure we are the best people we can be, we will find that we gain the power to change the world in meaningful ways, and that most importantly, we will do it naturally. If we are living in harmony with Tao and are responsive to intuition, it will become apparent to us where we are most needed. We will not neglect those closest to us in favor of those we have never met. Our ability to create lasting change will increase because we will not be trying to do so. It will be a natural result of the people we have become. The Taoist Whenever you advise a ruler in the way of Tao, counsel him not to use force to conquer the universe, for this would only cause resistance. Thorn bushes spring up wherever the army has passed. Lean years follow in the wake of a great war. Just do what needs to be done. Never taking advantage of power. Achieve results, but never glory in them. Achieve results, but never boast. Achieve results, but never be proud. Achieve results, because this is the natural way. Achieve results, but not through violence. Force is followed by loss of strength. This is not the way of Tao. That which goes against the Tao comes to an early end. I had to think about this chapter for quite a while, as I studied to make this video. I had to think quite a bit about what to write, and here's why. When we get on chapters like these, I have to really think through them, because I don't want to just spit out a five minute rant on how war is a problem. We all know that war is a problem. Nor do I want to just sit here and criticize or call out leaders of nations for sending their countries to war, because I don't think that would do much good for any of us. Whenever I make one of these videos, my primary concern is to try to craft together something that somebody can take and apply in their life and make it better in some way. I understand that a lot of people will choose not to do this, and that's fine. But for the small percentage of people who are actively trying to change their lives for the better, I want my videos to be able to contribute to their efforts in some meaningful way. Complaining about political warmongering would not achieve this goal, because most of us are not politicians. We don't have the ability to mobilize tens of thousands of people to fight each other. But we do have the ability to influence these events through how we live our lives. In the current political climate of the day, there is such a thing as political experience. This means that because in many countries the people are allowed to choose their leaders, politicians have a certain amount of accountability to those they govern. Unlike in some times and places where governance is or was absolute, we live in a time where public opinion does matter quite a lot in the political climate of a lot of countries. I know lots of people are jumping up and down in their seats to argue about the degree to which this is true, but the point is that at the end of the day, there are some invisible lines that politicians cannot cross, at least not publicly. Because they know that there will be consequences for their doing so. Now most democracies do have mechanisms in place for removing bad leaders, but far more than that, political leaders are held at least somewhat in check by the need to preserve their reputations with the populace, in order to stay in power. While it is pretty uncommon for political leaders in many countries to be forcibly ejected from power, they always have some kind of limit on how long they can hold power before they must be re-elected. And one of the most common tools that people hold for removing leaders that they disapprove of is simply the power to not re-elect them. I promise this is all going somewhere. What I'm trying to say by all of this is that at least to some degree, political leaders have an incentive to act somewhat in line with the popular mood. And because of this, the popular mood that is exported by a nation's people does have a direct influence on how national policies play out. Policies of war or peace are especially subject to this rule. In democratic countries, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for leaders to carry out or declare a war that is unpopular at home. What all this means is that to a large extent, the policies of a nation, especially in times of war, reflect the attitudes of the people. Therefore, one of our greatest tools in maintaining worldwide peace is our ability to become peaceful people ourselves. If we are petty, resentful, and vengeful with our friends, family members, and acquaintances, we can expect our nation to become likewise petty, resentful, and vengeful in its foreign policy. A nation is nothing more than a collection of individuals. We cannot be contentious with each other and expect our nation not to be contentious with other nations. As so many other things are, the condition of our nation is influenced by the condition of its most basic parts, the individual. If we want a peaceful world, we must become peaceable people at home, abroad, and in our schools, jobs, and environments. It is only at this most basic level that world peace can ever be realized. So when Lao Tzu says to advise our rulers not to use force, this applies to us too. But since most of us will never whisper to our presidents across a boardroom table, we advise them by showing them what we support. And as is always the case, our actions will speak volumes louder than our words. If you rejoice in victory, then you delight in killing. If you delight in killing, you cannot fulfill yourself. On happy occasions, precedence is given to the left. On sad occasions, to the right. In the army, the general stands on the left. The commander-in-chief on the right. This means that war is conducted like a funeral. When many people are being killed, they should be mourned in heartfelt sorrow. That is why a victory must be observed like a funeral. The End Well, the overall meaning of this chapter is pretty obvious. We should not hurt or kill other people. Perhaps there is an argument to be made that certain circumstances necessitate the use of violence, such as protecting one's family. But even in these circumstances, we should never find a sense of pleasure in harming others. If one seeks to find a sense of pleasure or power from the domination of others, this will inevitably lead to disaster. This is a desire that can never be satisfied, because, in the words of the great philosopher Qui-Gon Jinn, There's always a bigger fish. If we seek to gratify ourselves by asserting dominance over other people, we will always be chasing the next high. There will always be somebody stronger than us that we will desire to overcome. We will never be happy if we seek fulfillment in this way. Hopefully nobody watching this is actually seeking pleasure through physically harming others. But this same need to dominate does enter the lives of many of us in other ways. We seek to dominate each other, if not physically, then financially, socially, intellectually, or perhaps most tragically of all, even spiritually. Competition is a part of nature and a part of society. The basic economic structure of most countries around the world rely on competition. While it may not be possible to participate in society without participating in competition, we should be careful about our attitude as we do this. Do we participate in the economies of our countries in order to provide for ourselves and those we love? Or do we do so with a sense that acquiring more money or status than someone else would somehow make us better than them? Do we read and learn in order to enrich our lives and the lives of those around us? Or do we do so with a sense that acquiring more money or status than someone else would somehow make us better than them? Or do we do so with a covert sense of satisfaction way down deep in the back of our mind that we can almost ignore? A sense of satisfaction for knowing something that someone else doesn't? In our spiritual practices, are we humble followers of the high orders of the universe, seeking no more than to be truly at harmony with Tao and with all things? Or do we nurse a secret sense of spiritual pride in the fact that our lives are steeped in a deep spiritual experience that all the bozos around us could not possibly understand? This is a very dangerous urge, and will destroy even our best and most well-intentioned efforts to achieve it. This is a very dangerous urge, and will destroy even our best and most well-intentioned efforts to achieve it. This need to dominate is behind many of the worst parts of hustle culture, and we should not think that we will escape its consequences if we allow it to crop up in our spirituality. I think that most people that have ever had some sort of spiritual practice have been guilty of spiritual pride at some time or another. I personally struggle with this all the time. It doesn't do any good to sit and beat ourselves up about it. If we find ourselves guilty of spiritual pride in any degree, we can keep this at bay by looking outward. Try to focus on those around you, their hopes, dreams, and desires, and what their needs are. Try to see yourself in them. It may be that your financial, intellectual, or spiritual resources can be used to help meet one or more of their needs. As we draw closer to the Tao, we will inevitably be changed to do this naturally, so our spiritual practice should always focus on this. In our daily lives, as in battle, we should not see the domination of others as a point gained for ourselves, but rather see these others as people who are just as meaningful, important, and in need of love and understanding as we are. The Tao is nameless and unchanging. Though it appears insignificant, nothing in the world can contain it. If a ruler abides by its principles, then her people will willingly follow. Heaven would rain on earth, like sweet rain falling on paradise. People would have no need for laws, because the law would be written on their hearts. Naming is a necessity for order, but naming cannot order all things. The Tao is the only thing that can be called order. It is the only thing that can be called order. It is the only thing that can be called order. Naming often makes things impersonal, so we should know when naming should end. Knowing when to stop naming, you can avoid the pitfall it brings. All things end in the Tao, just as the small streams and largest rivers flow through valleys to the sea. flow through valleys to the sea. flow through valleys to the sea. So in this chapter, we get a little bit of a look at what may have been Lao Tzu's ideal for a perfect society. We'll get into that in a second, but first, let's take a look at the Tao. First, I do want to take a minute to cover the little reminder we get in this chapter of what is said in chapter 1, that names and titles are not precise, and are only words that we use to refer to things. and are only words that we use to refer to things. Naming things does not mean we understand them, and this is especially true for something as incomprehensible as the Tao. and this is especially true for something as incomprehensible as the Tao. Of course, we need to have names for things so that we can refer to them, but we need to be careful lest we think that we truly understand something just because we know its name. When we observe a friend having a hard time, we may come closer to them to try to understand what they are trying to say. or to try to understand what is going on. However, often if we are told at some point, Oh, she has depression, or Oh, he has PTSD, it's almost as if we stop trying to understand them and what they are going through, just because we can now name it. One person's struggles may be similar to another's, but they are not exactly the same, even if they share a label. And being able to put a name on something should not mean that we stop trying to understand a person and what they are going through. I was diagnosed as a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, also known, as I'm sure most of you are aware, as ADHD. At the time, it felt great to finally have a name for the symptoms I was experiencing. It felt vindicating and validating, because I felt like I finally had a reason for what I was going through, and it wasn't just that I was stupid or lazy. However, as I have gone on in life, I've found that my symptoms don't always quite fit in with the exact mold we call ADHD. And in researching and interacting with other people who have been similarly diagnosed, I've discovered that I'm not the only one. Actually, there is some research that is starting to come out that questions whether we're not just a little too quick to diagnose ADHD, especially in young children. Misdiagnosis can result in people thinking that they have conditions they might not have, and even erroneous prescription of medications, which is kind of a big deal. I understand that this may be the exception more than the rule. I'm not a medical professional or a mental health practitioner, and at the end of the day, this is all just my opinion. And I'm also not saying that we shouldn't try to understand and treat mental illness, quite the opposite. I'm just pointing out a possible example from my life of how emphasis on putting names on things can lead to errors if we're not careful. Now I want to take a second and focus on some of the lines in the middle of the chapter. If a ruler abides by its principles, meaning the Tao, then her people will willingly follow. Heaven would reign on earth, like sweet rain falling on paradise. People would have no need for laws, because the law would be written on their hearts. At the end of the day, laws are in place to try and protect us from ourselves. However, if we all really followed the Tao, these laws would not be necessary at all. We would already be at a state of oneness with all things, and with each other, and we could be counted on to act accordingly without having to be compelled to do so. While this is certainly a wonderful prospect, at this point in time, it is just that, a prospect, which does not currently reflect reality. The current reality of the world is that pretty much nobody is living completely in harmony with Tao, not even you or me. And anybody who thinks they are completely in harmony with Tao is probably farther away from it than most. If we compare ourselves to others, if we ever experience jealousy or envy, if we ever act or speak out of resentment towards another person, we are not in total harmony with Tao. Not because we don't measure up, or because somebody is going to cross our names off some cosmic list, but because we do not exist in a state that is conducive to total harmony. Oneness cannot coexist with separation, which is what we embody when we act or think in these ways. But although we need to be aware of this, we shouldn't beat ourselves up about it either. Being in harmony with Tao is the goal, but it's a goal that will probably take more than a lifetime to accomplish. All the teachings of Taoism, or philosophy and religion in general, are to help us to come as close to this as possible. Not through forcing ourselves to behave differently, but to help us to approach the Tao in such a way that it permeates and changes us to an ever-increasing degree. I think it's pretty obvious, however, that this is just not currently the case. As Taoists, we understand that there is no point in agonizing over this, or trying to force society to be something it isn't. Instead, we acknowledge the current state of affairs, and accept the need for governance and laws to maintain some kind of order. Because even though we know that it is not ideal, it is better than the alternative. Laws will only be rendered unnecessary when all people are in harmony with Tao. Until this happens, we have to just do the best we can with what we have. And remember, this isn't everyone else's fault. This is our fault too, because we also are not totally in harmony with Tao. But as we learn and apply true principles to our lives, we can certainly get much closer. Those who know themselves are truly wise. Those who master others are strong. Those who master themselves have true power. Those who know they have enough are truly wealthy. Those who persist will reach their goal. Those who keep their course have a strong will. Those who embrace death will not perish, but have life everlasting. Self-awareness is an extremely important concept in Taoism. Understanding the workings of society, people, and science is certainly valuable. However, if we chase these kinds of intellectual pursuits without taking time to understand the person behind our own eyelids, we will run into problems. The hard part is it's actually very difficult to become objectively aware of the self, because there is no person on earth who we have a greater incentive to misunderstand. Understanding of the self takes time and life experience, and there are some dangers we run into with regards to self-knowledge. One danger we run into is that sometimes we think we're practicing self-knowledge when we are actually just making our minds up not to change. As an IT customer service representative, I had many opportunities to help people fix problems with their technology, and I remember one of the most common things I would hear from customers would be something along the lines of I'm just not very good at technology. I would certainly not expect my customers to strive for an in-depth understanding of technology. Most of them had their own careers that they had worked in for years, and we can't expect to be experts in everything we do. However, from time to time, there were a few customers that more or less refused to learn to use the technology we provided them with. It seemed to me that some of these people would outright choose not to adopt the systems and technology we provided them with, regarding their technological ineptitude as an insurmountable barrier. We don't have to become experts in everything we do, but the human brain can learn a remarkable amount of things if we give it a fair chance. Sometimes we refuse opportunities to learn and grow, and hide behind our supposed self-knowledge as an excuse. I just can't do that. I'm no good at that sort of thing. That just isn't my style. We pull out many of these well-worn aphorisms to excuse ourselves from having to grow and change. But the problem is, most of us really don't have enough self-knowledge to really know what we're good at and what we're not. Another danger surrounding our quest for self-awareness is that so few people actually possess it. One of the most pervasive characteristics about human beings is being in denial. Most people walk around in massive amounts of denial about something, but usually about many things. We are highly incentivized not to really understand ourselves for many reasons, but one thing that makes it so hard is the baggage we pick up over our lives. True self-awareness is difficult, partly because we view ourselves through the lens of what we have learned over the course of our lives as good or bad. We make judgments about ourselves and accept them as truth. For example, we make lots of false negative assumptions, such as I'm just not very good at math, or I'm just an angry person. Often these judgments were based on beliefs that we somehow picked up early in our lives, many of which are just untrue, but which are rarely challenged, because, for example, if we believe we are bad at math, we just avoid math, and the statement becomes self-fulfilling. We also walk around with lots of false positive assumptions as well, often because of our need to feel like we are a good person, and because of the lessons we learned early in life about what a good person is. For example, say there is a girl that is raised in a family where girls are expected to be sweet and polite and quiet. Anytime she got angry, she was shamed for it, and was taught that it was wrong. She may go about for the rest of her life, identifying with the fact that she is sweet and cute and polite. She may present this outward image to everyone, and do such a good job that she even believes it herself. She, like almost everyone on earth, has a need to believe that she is a good person, and the story she has learned is that a good person means sweet and cute and polite. But inside, maybe she is not this at all. Maybe, unbeknownst to even to her, she is actually extremely angry and resentful because of the self expression she was never allowed to have. This anger will continue to build over the course of her life until she can no longer ignore it, until it manifests itself as physical problems and her body literally starts to break down. It's so hard to understand ourselves, because we don't really understand the world, or our place in it. The best way to come to really know ourselves is to draw closer to the Tao, which contains understanding of all selves and all things. The more in harmony with Tao that we become, the more truly ourselves we will be able to be. Yet it does not seek to master or control. Because it does not seek greatness, it is able to accomplish truly great things. One of the most difficult impulses for humans to master is the impulse to seek self-aggrandizement. We all want to be acknowledged and admired. Whenever we do something we think is good, we are quick to try to get recognized for our contribution. But when we do something we think is bad, we are just as quick to try and shift the blame to someone else. Lao Tzu targets this impulse in chapter 34 of the Tao Te Ching. In this chapter he teaches by referring us to the ultimate example, Tao, the higher power and order of the universe. Tao is the origin of all things living and non-living. Without it, none of us would exist. Tao is constantly in motion, creating, moving, changing, and even as it permeates all of creation, keeping it in order, watching over all things, creating all things, existing at the heart of all things, it does not take credit for what it does. It does not announce its dominance over all things from a high stage, or give us a list of updates on everything it has accomplished. In fact, it remains largely hidden from the public eye. Any publicity it does get is what other people have written or said about it. Whether you believe in Tao, a god, or any other kind of higher power, these beings and forces all have one thing in common. Not everybody believes in them. But certainly if there was some sort of all-powerful force or being in the universe, it would have the power to make itself known to everyone, thereby compelling everyone to believe in it. However, this doesn't seem to be higher power's agenda. Whatever you do believe in, all throughout the course of humanity, this higher power has never made itself known to the entire world in any overt or obvious way, favoring instead to remain behind the scenes, orchestrating the entirety of creation, and yet allowing everyone the freedom to believe or disbelieve as they so choose. This is an example for all of us to follow. Whenever we accomplish something, we can try to think of it no differently than if someone else had done it. A person who has become truly humble can make something, and know that it is the best of its kind, and find joy in it the same way they would find joy in something similarly beautiful that they had just happened upon, such as a sunset, a waterfall, or music from an excellent musician they happened to pass by. If we are truly humble, our joy is in the fact that the thing was done, not necessarily that it was done by us. This is how accomplishments are viewed from the Tao's perspective. Rather than presenting itself to be believed in and praised, it just goes about doing what it does. I want to talk a little bit more about this idea of belief, because at the end of the day, Tao doesn't need our belief, and has never laid claim on it. It is what it is, and will go on being what it is whether we believe in it or not. No, Tao does not need us to believe in it. We need us to believe in it. Our efforts to draw nearer to Tao, and to eventually become one with it, benefit us more than they benefit Tao. We need closeness and oneness with Tao in order to be truly at peace. Tao is the way, and our choice whether or not to walk in this way determines the character and nature of our lives. It's not that Tao is some kind of cosmic cop watching to see if we are doing what we're supposed to do, and doling out rewards and punishments accordingly. Quite the contrary. We choose added peace or added suffering by choosing whether or not to follow Tao, or the way. It's the difference between trying to impress a panel of judges that will punish you if you screw up, and walking on a bridge with water on each side. Nobody is punishing you if you choose to step off the road. But the laws of nature dictate that if you step off the bridge, you will get wet. Nobody is punishing you for anything. The consequence of getting wet is simply a result of laws that neither you nor the Tao can change. It's just a function of the way things are. The same goes for following Tao. Tao does not try and get even with us if we choose not to follow it. The consequences are just a function of the way the universe works. If we stubbornly hold onto our desires, and attempt to force things to go our way, it will always end in disaster. Putting off desires, embracing softness and quietness, following intuition, these things are not steps we check off on a list, so that we can earn somebody's favor, or so that we can be good people. They are just steps along the path that lead to Tao, and the oneness and peace that we will find there. She who follows the way of the Tao will draw the world to her steps. She can go without fear of being injured, because she has found peace and tranquility in her heart. Where there is mutual harmony, love and peace, mana philosopher and Taoist guru Ch�ена Nipunam pekas want to talk a little bit about today. See, almost all humans share at least one fatal flaw, the horror and neglect of the obvious. Often, we act like we don't have the solutions to our problems, but much of the time, we have all the solutions we need. We just can't bring ourselves to apply them. We know that having a healthy lifestyle is pretty simple. Eat less, eat better things, and exercise regularly. Yet, we are constantly on the hunt for the new best diet or the shiniest new workout plan. In reality, we would probably get perfectly fine results from the most basic or rudimentary diet and exercise plan. Literally almost any plan would do. But instead of just consistently applying one, we often allow ourselves to get so caught up in the search for the best one that we never actually start one at all. One example of this in my life is sleep. All throughout high school, I struggled with waking up on time. I was constantly in danger of being kicked out of my early morning extracurriculars. I nearly drove my parents crazy. I tried everything to get up on time, playing music, putting my alarm at the other side of the room, I even put thumbtacks on the top of my alarm clock to poke me when I hit the alarm button. It seemed like I had tried everything and nothing was working. Well, I should say that I tried almost everything. Because the funny thing is, after graduation, I stopped sleeping in almost instantly once I stopped going to bed at midnight every night. Once again, this was a very simple and easy way to get up on time. I was able to get up on time, and I was able to get up on time. I was able to get up on time, and I was able to get up on time. I was able to get up on time, and I was able to get up on time. It was a pretty obvious solution, going to bed earlier, but my failure to apply the simplest and most obvious solution to my problem led me to somehow believe that my problem was just too big to overcome. As is so very consistent with human nature, I was looking for a grand and creative solution to my issue, when the real solution was simple, obvious, and characteristically boring. See, concepts of the Tao can be like this too. We keep looking for the next self-help book, or the next program to make us finally feel at peace and happy. But the answers have been around us for thousands of years. They can be found in almost all major religions, and are supported in many major philosophies as well. Learn to master your desires and selfishness, and seek oneness with the greater power of the universe. Some people call this Tao, others call it God, some call it the higher self. But at the end of the day, the essence is largely the same, and it usually has to do with putting aside what you want to do in favor of the path the universe, God, or the Tao places before you. Compared to advice we get from advertisements, hustle icons, and financial gurus, this advice seems overly simple and overly boring. It is much more appealing to believe that we can become happy by finding our dream job, amassing enough stuff, and impressing the people around us. We worship people that overcome huge physical odds, and develop deviously creative solutions to their problems. It's tempting to believe that happiness will come when we buy the next thing or accomplish the next goal, because it's a lot easier to buy something than to actually get your life in order. But the longer we put off the rush, the more we feel like we're in a position to do something that we don't want to do. The more we put off the rush, the more we feel like we're in a position to do something that we don't want to do. The longer we put off the rush, the more we feel like we're in a position to do something that we don't want to do. The longer we put off the rush, the more we work of putting aside our own desires, the worse our lives will get, until we ultimately become so miserable that we give up altogether or we are forced to change our lives. This is certainly one way to live life, but it's not a very fun way. Often, we know deep down what we need to do about the problems we are facing. If we can learn to embrace the boring solutions and apply them consistently and diligently, we will usually be much better off. If you want something to return to the source, you can find it on our website, if you want something to weaken, you must first allow it to become strong. If you want something to be removed, you must first allow it to flourish. If you want to possess something, you must first give it away. This is called the subtle understanding of how things are meant to be. The soft and pliable overcomes the hard and inflexible. Just as fish remain hidden in deep waters, it is best to keep weapons out of sight. This chapter of the Tao Te Ching is a great example of the Chinese philosophical concept of yin and yang. Yin and yang is the concept of two opposite forces coexisting as different halves of the same whole. In Western philosophy, we tend to look at opposites as being mutually exclusive. If something is long, it can't be short. If something is hot, it can't be short. If something is hot, it can't be short. If something is hot, it can't be short. If something is hot, it can't be short. If something is hot, it can't be short. It therefore cannot be cold. Chinese philosophy presents this matter a bit differently, however. In Taoism, two opposite things are seen rather as two sides of the same coin, opposing forces that are complementary as a result of their opposition. Something is only long because short exists. Hot is only hot because cold exists. All things are part of a balance, and things cannot exist without their opposites. Therefore, all things are one, and opposition creates the possibility of being. Taoism teaches us that because all things exist in opposition, the key to obtaining something is to first reconcile yourself with its opposite. This sounds a little counterintuitive, but there are plenty of examples from life that illustrate this. We never fully appreciate or understand something until we have first experienced its opposite. You never really understand what it means to have a partner that truly loves and sees you until you have had partners who did not, or you have spent a good deal of time alone. You can never master any skill without first spending thousands of hours being bad at it while you learn. If you want an example from the world of finance, here's one. It's been estimated that in all families that attain significant amounts of wealth, 70% of them lose their wealth by the next generation, and 90% lose it by the generation after that. While there may be many reasons for this, many experts hypothesize that this inability to preserve wealth over multiple generations comes because of the immense difficulty of teaching money management skills to children who have never had to worry about money before. Many parents, through a combination of luck, work, and creativity, are able to amass a great deal of wealth over their lives, only to discover that their children, never having experienced poverty, are not truly able to experience wealth in any sustainable way. In order to experience true companionship, you must first experience aloneness. In order to be a master of something, you must first be a student. And in order to truly experience wealth, it greatly helps to first experience poverty. When we seek to possess or attain something, we usually put all our efforts towards gaining and holding that thing, thinking that this is the most direct way of keeping it. However, Taoism teaches that if you want to truly possess something, the best way to do this is to first be okay with not possessing it. See, if you need something so badly that you cannot reconcile yourself with not having it, you will never truly have that thing, because you will always live in fear of not having it. Therefore, even while this thing is in your grasp, you are living in a place of not having it, because you are living in a place of not having it. The only possibility you have is in your life to have it. The only possible future that you dread. Imagine a person who finally meets the love of his life, but lives in constant fear of her dying or leaving him. Even as they eat the same food, go to the same places, and sleep in the same bed, he doesn't really have her. Because of his fear, he lives more in a possible future of not having her than he does in the present with her. Imagine a man that finally, after a lifetime of saving, is able to purchase his dream car. He now has the car, but barely drives it at all for fear of scratching or damaging it. When he does drive it, he cannot truly enjoy it because of the stress it causes him. Therefore, even in having, he does not really have. For these two hypothetical people, as for all of us, the solution is to reconcile oneself with not having the thing desired. Find the possibility of a world where the thing you want is taken away from you or never happens at all, and allow yourself to come to a place where you can accept and come to peace with this prospect. This has been one of the overarching lessons of my entire life, and I can promise you that the peace that comes when you can do this is real. It may be that you have to do this exercise repeatedly, and that's totally fine, but from my own experience, if you cannot learn to accept and flow with the opposition in your life, you are in for a life of total misery. If you can learn to do this, however, and it is really simple, even if it's not easy, then you will be able to truly have things in ways you have never been able to before. Tao abides in non-action, yet nothing is left undone. If kings and lords observed this, the ten thousand things would develop naturally. If they still desired to act, they would return to the simplicity of formless substance. Without form, there is no desire. Without desire, there is tranquility. Without desire, there is tranquility. Without desire, there is tranquility. Without desire, there is tranquility. Without desire, there is tranquility. And in this way, all things would be at peace. Doing through the act of non-doing is one of the most classic, and also one of the least understood concepts in Taoism. I see so many people misunderstanding what this means, to the point that they either reject Taoism altogether, or apply it in ways that do not benefit their lives. Many people mistakenly think that non-doing means that Taoists can never have goals and can never get anything done, but actually the opposite is true. If you can really be a Taoist and be a Taoist all the time, what you are doing is a great If you can really wrap your head around the concept of non-doing or effortless action, you'll be shocked to discover how much you are able to get done, and those around you will likely be shocked as well. So to understand how this works, let's break down the concept a little bit. One excellent example I can think of to illustrate the principle of non-doing is getting out of quicksand. Now, I should make the disclaimer here that I have never once been stuck in quicksand in my entire life, so don't go jumping in the stuff just because Sanjoy is supposed to have told you how to get out of it. However, from all the research I've undertaken from the safety of my cushy office chair, it seems that pretty much everyone has agreed that the worst thing you can do if you're stuck in quicksand is to struggle to free yourself. Frantically struggling to get out only causes you to sink faster. The secret, it seems, is to do the exact opposite of what your instincts are screaming at you to do. Stay calm, and make small, slow movements. It turns out that moving slowly seems to allow water to come down in around your body and loosen the quicksand up a bit. The videos I watched said to slowly try to move onto your back, which will allow you to float, and from there, you can slowly work your way to the side. This is an example of wu-wei inaction. Of course, in this case, as in many other cases in life, the answer isn't complete inaction. I mean, you've got to get out of the pool somehow, right? But desperate forcing only makes the situation worse. Instead, the thing to do is to move calmly and deliberately, and, get this, to actually lean back into the situation you find yourself in. When we think of the word wu-wei, we think of the word wu-wei as a word that means to move. When we get into an undesirable situation, our first impulse is usually to try and get out as quickly as possible. But doing this only leads to further problems. We are much better off to lean into and accept our situation, choosing to adapt to what is, rather than trying to force it to be something it isn't. The quicksand is what it is. We can refuse to accept it and struggle to distance ourselves from it, but this will not change the reality of the quicksand. Instead, we can acknowledge what has happened, and calmly follow our intuitions in taking the best course from where we are. Now again, in this example, the solution is not inaction, but rather smooth, deliberate action in accordance with the situation. Sometimes, however, a situation does not require our action at all. Throughout my life, I have had a persistent habit of arguing when I felt that I was being treated unfairly. If I think that I've been wronged in a close relationship, my first impulse is often to bring it up as quickly as possible. Usually, my thinking in this is that if I can get the problem out in the open right away, it can be dealt with immediately before it becomes a chronic issue. I sometimes have this unfortunate tendency to think that my current situation will be permanent unless I do something quickly to change it. However, especially over the past year or so, I've begun to realize how flawed this logic is. I definitely think that open communication in a relationship is super important, but I'm starting to learn that there are better times and better ways of going about it than others. I think one of the absolute best relationship practices I've discovered recently for avoiding serious problems, at least with me personally, has been to wait for the right time to change it. I think that I can wait for a few hours before bringing up something that's bothering me. By doing this, I give myself time to calm down and to see things a bit more reasonably. Often, after reflecting on the issue for a while, I find that I was really the one at fault in the first place, or that I completely misread the situation. Often, after giving myself this period to think and feel, I realize that no action is needed at all, and the situation simply resolves itself. I'm not recommending that we always default to never bringing up issues with people. I'm just saying that for me, it has helped massively to pause for just a few hours before taking any action, so that I have some time to consider the situation objectively, rather than instantly grabbing the proverbial pitchfork to defend myself against a perceived attack on my rights. Often, by the simple act of practicing some temporary non-doing, my best work in relationships is done. So, to cap off what we've talked about so far, non-doing isn't necessarily doing nothing, although it can certainly mean that. At its core, non-doing is the act of putting aside your need to have things your way, so that you can objectively observe a situation and calmly take the best course of action. But how does one determine what the best course of action is? Well, logic does have its place here, but I personally don't believe that logic is quite enough for all situations, or really for any situation. See, our logic has limits, and will always be stuck within the confines of our fatally flawed human perspectives. This limitation makes the need for intuition clear. Intuition has been studied and philosophized about, ever since the dawn of mankind, but nobody has ever really been able to put their finger on it, much like the Tao itself. It seems that within all of us resides this soft, small voice, sometimes called a gut feeling, that whispers directions from time to time that we can either choose to listen to or ignore. Learning to listen to and hear your intuition is a lifelong process, and requires a large amount of trial and error, but it does get a lot easier if you regularly take time for meditation or even just quiet contemplation. When you are doing this, you will sometimes notice thoughts, floating gently up to the surface of your mind. Ideas, impulses. You can distinguish these from just everyday thoughts, because there's sort of a goodness and innocence in them, that you can feel if you pay attention. If you start working to cultivate this sensitivity to intuition, you will get better and better at it as you go. Adopting a philosophy of quiet, softness, effortless action, and responsiveness to intuition, will lead us down the path that leads to oneness with Tao and increased peace in our lives. The highest good is not to seek to do good, but to allow yourself to become it. The ordinary person seeks to do good things, and finds that they cannot do them continually. The master does not force virtue on others, thus she is able to accomplish her task. The ordinary person who uses force will find that they accomplish nothing. The kind person acts from the heart, and accomplishes a multitude of things. The righteous person acts out of pity, yet leaves many things undone. The moral person will act out of duty, and when no one will respond, will roll up his sleeves and use force. When the Tao is forgotten, there is righteousness. When righteousness is forgotten, there is morality. When morality is forgotten, there is the law. The law is the husk of faith, and trust is the beginning of chaos. Our basic understandings are not from the Tao, because they come from the depths of our misunderstanding. The master abides in the fruit, and not in the husk. The master abides in the fruit, and not in the husk. The master abides in the fruit, and not in the husk. She dwells in the Tao, and not with the things that hide it. The master abides in the fruit, and not in the husk. This is how she increases in wisdom. The Tao is not the only thing that is hidden from the world. Okay, so this chapter, as you may have noticed, is a little bit longer, and it is just packed with things to consider. Because of this, I've decided to split the discussion of this chapter into two parts. For today's part, I want to talk a little bit about the first few lines. The highest good is not to seek to do good, but to allow yourself to become it. The ordinary person seeks to do good things, and finds that they cannot do them continually. There are many different reasons for trying to be a good person. Often we act rightly out of a motivation to please or impress others, to preserve our belonging in a group or family unit, or even just to not be in trouble. We also sometimes strive to act rightly out of a need to feel like we're a good person. Now, before we get too judgmental and start pointing fingers here, let's keep in mind that pretty much everyone has tried to act rightly out of one or more of these motivations in their lifetime. Most of us oscillate between several or all of them on a daily basis. This isn't a time for calling out others. It's a time for recognizing in ourselves the basic motivations that guide pretty much all of humanity. And that's fine. I think we can probably say that it's better, for example, not to kill somebody than to kill them, even if you abstain simply out of self-preservation or adherence to social expectations. We're going to talk more about the hierarchy of motivations in the part 2 video, but for now, let's just say that although it may often be better to act rightly for the wrong reasons than to act wrongly, this may not always be the case. So, let's get started. For example, most cultures consider it wrong to lie. However, there could potentially be a situation where you could be forced to lie in order to save somebody's life. Hard, fast rules about what is right or wrong are good to have if we do not have the benefit of Tao and intuition, but they are not an adequate substitute for it. The other problem with doing the right thing for the wrong reasons is that wrong reasons will never give us the juice to continue doing good indefinitely. We may temporarily be able to rise to the level of our ambitions, but we will always, inevitably, fall back to the level of our character. Good intentions simply are not enough to cause a person to always do good things. Suboptimal motivations will eventually run out of steam. So, what is the solution to this problem? The solution is to embrace and follow Dao. But when I say follow Dao, I do not mean simply start studying Daoism. Daoism is not the Dao as we learned in chapter 1. The Dao is the Dao. All the teachings in Daoism are nothing more than guidelines for finding harmony with Dao. Anybody who follows Dao will learn that Dao is not the Dao. Anybody can seek the higher order of the universe by putting aside their desires and responding to intuition, not just Daoists. If we get the idea that being a Daoist is the same thing as following the Dao, we leave ourselves critically vulnerable to spiritual pride. The natural human tendency under this assumption is to begin looking around and thinking to the self how different we Daoists really are from everyone else. We make Daoism a clique, a club, an exclusive faction of exceptional individuals who, unlike everyone else, are able to feel, think, and understand Daoism. In short, we start to think that Daoists are special, simply because they are Daoists. Many people are attracted to Daoism because of its apparent differences with organized religions such as Christianity. If that describes you, however, know that this sort of spiritual smugness I've been talking about may be the very same vice you saw in others which made their religion seem so unattractive to you. The reality of the situation is that while pretty much any religion can better a person, people are still people, no matter what religion or philosophy they adhere to. There are good apples and bad bananas in every bunch. But also, there are just a whole lot of medium melons, people whose hearts are in the right place, who are trying to live up to the standards of their respective faith, but still make plenty of mistakes. That's me, and to be honest, that's probably you too. In actuality, any person in the world can follow the Dao, be they of whatever religion they may. A Christian, Muslim, or Buddhist may be following the Dao just as well or better than a Daoist might. Daoism is just a collection of advice for doing what all major religions seek to do, to come into harmony with all things and with the higher power of the universe, whatever they happen to call it. It's just that Daoism packages this advice a little differently. Daoism is not a ticket for being one with the Dao. It's an instruction manual that anyone can follow. The overarching lesson of Daoism is to put aside your desires, seek harmony with the higher order of the universe, and be flexible and open to being guided by Dao, which is to say being guided by the Dao. Doing this will enable us not only to do good, but to truly be good. As we walk down this road, every step we take closer to Dao changes us for the better. Then, we will be able to truly be instead of only do. Daoism will show us how to do good without forcing. It's kind of like the difference between a ditch and a river. A ditch cuts directly through the land to bring water to some desired location for some purpose that may or may not actually benefit mankind in the long run. Rather than doing good in this way, we want to be able to do good in the future. We want to become like rivers, flowing naturally with the land, following the path laid for us by Dao, and nourishing everything we pass by, simply because of what we are. I'm really trying to describe the difference between these two in a way that isn't too ethereal and that makes sense. Let me know in the comments if it's helping or if you guys have any questions. A truly good man is not aware of his goodness and is therefore good. A foolish man tries to be good and is therefore not good. A truly good man does nothing, yet leaves nothing undone. A foolish man is always doing, yet much remains to be done. When a truly kind man does something, he leaves nothing undone. When a just man does something, he leaves a great deal to be done. When a disciplinarian does something and no one expands he rolls up his sleeves in an attempt to enforce order. Therefore, when Dao is lost, there is goodness. When goodness is lost, there is kindness. There is all the many things Dao has been trying to say about goodness. is lost, there is kindness. When kindness is lost, there is justice. When justice is lost, there is ritual. Now ritual is the husk of faith and loyalty, the beginning of confusion. Knowledge of the future is only a flowery trapping of Tao. It is the beginning of folly. Therefore, the truly great man dwells on what is real and not what is on the surface, on the fruit and not the flower. Therefore, accept the one and reject the other. Yesterday, we focused a lot on the first few lines of chapter 38 from the Tao Te Ching. Today, we're going to focus a bit more on the middle and end. And for those of you who noticed, yes, I did use a different translation of chapter 38 for this video than I used for yesterday's video. This is intentional because I like the added perspective of a second translation, especially with this chapter in particular. With that in mind, let's take a look at these lines in the middle of the chapter. Therefore, when Tao is lost, there is kindness. When kindness is lost, there is justice. When justice is lost, there is ritual. Now ritual is the husk of faith and loyalty, the beginning of confusion. I've seen other translations where this goodness that comes about when we lose the Tao is translated as virtue or righteousness. It can be thought of, if you will, as a person's opinions and distinctions about what is right and what is wrong. Certainly, virtue and goodness are not bad things in and of themselves. But when we lose the Tao, we lose the right and the wrong. When we lose the Tao, we lose the right and the wrong. When we lose the Tao, we lose the right and the wrong. When we lose the Tao, we lose the right and the wrong. It would probably be much better to have a society of virtuous people than a society of people that observe no moral boundaries whatsoever. However, virtue, or a person's opinion of what is right and wrong, does have its limits. After all, not everybody agrees about what is right and wrong. All across civilizations, there does seem to be a sort of general moral code of things a person ought and ought not to do. Stealing, for example, does seem to be universally unacceptable by pretty much all moral codes. However, most moral codes are not acceptable. They are not acceptable because they are not the same as the moral codes that are used to protect one's family and friends. Moral codes around the world and throughout time also seem to have some gray areas where actions that would normally be outlawed are given allowance under certain circumstances. For example, is stealing wrong if one is stealing back something that was stolen from them in the first place? Violence against other people is another example of something that pretty much all moral codes disallow. However, these same moral codes usually make exceptions if one is forced to use violence to protect oneself or one's family. Although some things may seem pretty black and white in theory, there often ends up being a lot of difference between moral codes and the moral codes of the world. People are also very good at justifying all kinds of acts as being virtuous, even to themselves. One of my passions is studying history, and let me tell you, if any of you guys get into studying the French Revolution, you will simply have to spend some time with my old friend Maximilien Robespierre. I use the word friend in only a flippant sense, of course, because man oh man, this guy was a serious piece of work. Maximilien Robespierre was probably the biggest of the bunch that brought us the terror. He was the one who was the most important person in the world. He was the one who was the most important person in the world. He was the one who was the most important person in the world. Which is a name for the period of the French Revolution where you couldn't hardly make a joke without being sent to have your head chopped off. In the early days of the revolution, Robespierre seemed alright. He came onto the scene as a skilled lawyer, anxious to serve his fellow man, and to play his part in what looked to be a new era of liberty and equality for Europe. He tirelessly advocated for causes such as universal suffrage, the discontinuation of feudal privileges held by stuffy aristocrats that refused to pay their share in taxes, even the abolition of French involvement in the slave trade. He earned the nickname The Incorruptible because of his uncompromising dedication to virtue, even in the face of ridicule and opposition from his peers. Robespierre had an ideal of a country that was motivated primarily by virtue, which he called the Republic of Virtue. However, as time went on, and Robespierre suddenly found himself one of the most powerful men in France, because things moved very quickly in the French Revolution, it became apparent that the Republic of Virtue he envisioned for his country was just not panning out. Peasant mobs sought to take hold of the Revolution through violent uprisings and protests, but they were forced to take their lives. They were forced to die and to be taken care of, uprisings and protests, while wars with other European powers threatened to crush the revolution from the outside. Paranoia of anti-revolutionary plots reached a fever pitch. And in the midst of all this, we get Robespierre's version of The Lion and the Dowdaging that talks about the disciplinarian rolling up his sleeves to enforce order. Political executions didn't start or end with Robespierre, but boy oh boy did he give them their heyday. Now some of these people he had guillotined probably were anti-revolutionary conspirators, but especially towards the end, the killing got more and more indiscriminate. People started getting executed for crimes such as pocket picking or meeting under suspicious circumstances. One group of nuns was executed for the crime of living together communally. Public support, which had once rallied around Robespierre, now began to wane as it became clear that he intended to massacre his way to his republic of virtue, whatever that meant. Finally, the people turned on Robespierre, and through a combination of political conspiracy and mob action, he was left stripped of power, gruesomely injured, and killed. He was then killed in a murderous attempt to kill his own family. Robespierre was then injured, and soon after, he was fed to Madame Le Guillotine himself. In attempting to reach his republic of virtue by force, Robespierre lost whatever virtue he had ever had. This story has always intrigued me because it serves as such a chilling cautionary tale. We see here, among many other things, a rather extreme example of what happens when people are left to their own distinctions of right and wrong, and attempt to impose them by force. The tale of the incorruptible Robespierre shows us just how corruptible human beings really are. Again, it's not that virtue is bad in and of itself. It's just that our ideas of right and wrong are so hard to separate from other factors, such as our political ideals, our upbringing, our preferences, and even our own naked self-interest. Therefore, when Tao is lost, and goodness or virtue takes over, it is certainly better than nothing, but it is not ideal, because it places our fate and the fate of other people up to our own flawed individual perceptions of what is good and bad. If we lose goodness or virtue, the next level is kindness. Once again, kindness certainly is not a bad thing in and of itself, but we will not always do the right thing simply by trying to be kind to people. This is a lower law and has a lower level of positive output. Lower than this is a focus on justice. Certainly justice ought to be observed, but without being tempered by mercy, wisdom, and intuition, justice becomes a cold, calculating force that can be turned toward atrocity at a moment's notice. People don't usually hurt each other for no reason. Whenever people go to war, either on a national or a personal level, they almost always do so with a sense of having been somehow wronged. But if we spend our entire lives trying to get our own from people who we think have wronged us, our lives will have no room for contentment or peace. Once justice goes out the window, we are left only with ritual. Ritual is a part of life. It gives a sense of rhythm and safety and is valuable for impressing certain lessons upon us over a long period of time. As long as we can keep in mind the reason for the ritual. But ritual alone is vastly inadequate for producing a good society or a good life. Civilizations that base their morality solely on ritual have never thrived. Rituals often begin as a way of teaching a lesson or guiding a person's actions. But the problem with rituals is that it is so easy for the point of the ritual to become lost in the observation of the ritual itself. Therefore, a focus on rituals is the beginning of confusion. The obsessive observation of dead rituals is one hallmark feature, of a civilization in decline. Once again, as I hope I've made clear, it's not that virtue, kindness, justice, or ritual are bad. It's just that they are increasingly inadequate replacements for closeness with the Tao and with the ability to feel and respond to its subtle pushes and pulls. Quietness, softness, an ability to put our desires aside, and a responsiveness to intuition will allow us to do right naturally. These substitutes are only ways of trying to force ourselves and others to do something that cannot be achieved by force. If we can approach the Tao with willing and open hearts, we will become virtuous, kind, and just anyway. Focus on the one and you get the rest thrown in. Focus on the others and you get none of it. The masters of old attained unity with the Tao. Heaven attained unity and became pure. The earth attained unity and found peace. The spirits attained unity so they could minister. The valleys attained unity that they might be full. Humanity attained unity that they might flourish. Their leaders attained unity that they might set the example. This is the power of unity. Without unity, the sky becomes filthy. Without unity, the earth becomes unstable. Without unity, the spirits become unresponsive and disappear. Without unity, the valleys become dry as a desert. Without unity, humankind can't reproduce and becomes extinct. Without unity, our leaders become corrupt and fall. The great view the small as their source, and the high takes the low as their foundation. Their greatest asset becomes their humility. They speak of themselves as orphans and widows. Thus, they truly seek humility. Do not shine like the precious gem, but be as dull as a common stone. Eastern cultures often refer to this concept of unity or oneness with all things. To those who did not grow up around this idea, it can seem a little ethereal. It can seem ethereal and vague. My goal for this video is to take this concept of oneness with all things and explain it to where it becomes a concrete idea that we can understand and use in our lives. Unity is the highest state of being, and reaching a state of oneness with the Tao and with all things is the whole point of Taoism. But what does this actually mean? To understand this a bit better, let's take a look at the part of the chapter where it says, the great view the small as their source, and the high takes the low as their foundation. If we look at these lines with our sort of Western, good, better, best way of seeing things, this can seem a little insulting, honestly. Isn't it a bit condescending of a leader to view those he leads as his foundation? Doesn't that just kind of feed into the problem of the exalted few placing themselves above the unwashed masses? Well, if you view it that way, then of course it does. But it's not because of what's in the text, it's because of the way you're looking at it. Our tendency to look at the lines in this way, and believe me, I did too at first, only betrays the limitations of our perspective. It indicates to us that we have not yet learned to see all things as one. This isn't something to feel down about, it's just kind of like an indicator on the dashboard telling us what's going on with our thought life. See, for Laozi, all things truly are one. When we see a mountain, we don't usually say, oh, that's a pile of high rocks sitting on a bunch of low rocks. We say, oh, that's a mountain. We view the mountain not as separate parts in some kind of elevational hierarchy, but as one mountain, one whole. When we do distinguish the separate parts, such as when we want to refer to the peak specifically, we do so objectively and without a special preference or emotion. We say peak simply for the purpose of communicating that we are referring to the very top of the mountain. We don't feel or express any ideas about the peak being different from the rest of the mountain in terms of importance or significance, only in position. This is an objective distinction that does not favor one thing above another. To me, I think this is kind of the idea allowed to be used by the people of the world, and I think it's the most important thing that we can do. Just as a peak is in a different physical location from the other parts of a mountain without being any more important, so too is a quote-unquote great person in a different position from the average person, and they should regard this without considering themselves as being somehow separate from them. They are all part of the same whole, and each has a unique and important part to play. Without a foundation, a peak crumbles. Similarly, in an ecosystem, all organisms have a vital role to play in the symphony of nature. We tend to especially admire the fact that the peak is a part of the whole, and that the whole is a part of the whole. We tend to especially admire large and powerful creatures, such as tigers, bears, and wolves, but they are no more vital to the survival of the ecosystem than plants, algae, and bacteria. Without these smaller, but no less essential members, life could not continue. We need the plants to provide oxygen, and plant eaters to take nutrients from plants and make them available to meat eaters. We need meat eaters to control the populations of plant eaters so that they don't run out of food and die. We need microorganisms to return the nutrients from animals to the earth, so the plants can survive. We need the plants to provide oxygen, so the plants can survive. All things and all people are important and unique parts of the same giant whole. As we draw closer to the Tao, we discover our place in this whole, and we fill it gladly. We play our part with contentedness and satisfaction. We don't aspire to play the part of someone else. Thus, the greatest asset of a quote-unquote great person, or really any person, is their humility, which can also be seen as their acknowledgement of oneness with all things and lack of unnecessary focus on the self. Focusing primarily on the self, we can see that the self is not only a part of the whole, but also a part of the whole. The self is a symptom of separation, or the perception of the self as separate from all other selves. The whole point of Taoism is to put aside our selfish desires, which are some of the main weapons with which we wage this war of separation, and to learn to see ourselves as one with all things. If you're wondering exactly how to do this, I would recommend a thorough study of chapter 13 from the Tao Te Ching. Returning is the motion of the Tao. Yielding is the way of the Tao. The ten thousand things are born of being. Being is born of not being. We live in a world that largely runs on cycles. The natural world is full of cycles. Things are born and then die, and the cycle is continued by their offspring. Similarly, we experience cycles in our personal lives. Our sleep patterns, interest in our work, feelings of well-being, and energy throughout the day, to name a few, all operate on cycles. Despite a lifetime of evidence that this can never work, we as human beings still try over and over again to abandon the cyclical nature of our lives. We still cling to the belief that we can make the enjoyable parts of our cycles last forever, or that we can banish the less desirable parts for good. We stubbornly hold on, often subconsciously, to the idea that if we just diet better and exercise better, and meditate more consistently, and get a better handle on our sleep, and bring whatever we want to our lives, we will be able to live longer. We think that if we can just get a little better at doing this or that, we will finally be able to find ourselves perpetually full of energy and a lust for life, untiring in the pursuit of whatever it is we think we should be accomplishing. Laozi recognized the futility of these sorts of ideals. Returning is the motion of the Tao. Yielding is the way of the Tao. The 10,000 things are born of being. Being is born of not being. The Tao operates in cycles. The way of Tao is understanding and accepting these cycles as a part of life and adapting to them. Sometimes things are, and sometimes they aren't. Rather than frantically trying to control things that defy complete control, we are much better off to identify what factors we can influence, and allow those we can't influence to be what they are. There are many ways we can use this advice in our personal lives. If you don't mind me sharing a couple of personal examples from my own life, I'll try and illustrate this. I have always been a person that greatly enjoys being outside. I love summer and fall for all the opportunities they provide to get out in nature. But for years now, winter has been a real struggle for me. I live in a part of the world where winter means cold, snow, and less sunlight. Because of these and maybe a few other factors, although I enjoy winter all through December when it still feels like a novelty, by about the middle of January, I'm sick and tired of it. I tend to get pretty gloomy around this time. And just kind of have a harder time picking myself up emotionally. However, this last year, because of changes in my work and the things I was doing with my family, I ended up getting outside a lot more during the winter. Interestingly, as I spent more time out in the winter weather, I came to enjoy and really appreciate it for what it was. This has been one of the longest winters I can remember, and it's only in the last week or two that I think we've finally seen the last of the snow. But honestly, I haven't even minded it. Even though I wasn't really even able to get out of the snow, or even going about it intentionally, I was able to accept and embrace the season for what it was by getting out into the weather and experiencing what the season made available to experience, rather than just lamenting the absence of summer from indoors. My second example is from when I was studying at university. Now, I suppose it's only fair to make the disclaimer that I'm probably not the person to be throwing around advice on studying, since I did end up dropping out of college myself. However, my grades were very good when I was there, and the semester I dropped out was the semester I would have been able to take advantage of a pretty decent scholarship because of my grades, so it's not like I was just failing everything. At any rate, this was just something that worked for me, and the whole point of this video is to find the cycles that exist in your own life and adapt to them. So I hope you guys will take this example as an illustration of this principle, rather than as specific advice on how to study. When I was at college, I found I was having problems getting my work done. I worked part-time and was taking a full course load, and I often found myself staying up late to finish my work. However, I noticed that after a certain point in the night, my work became much slower, and I would often have to stay up lengthy amounts of time at night in order to finish what would have taken me far less time during the day. So instead, I started going to bed earlier and waking up early the next morning to finish my work. Between how much better I felt in the morning, and the added pressure to finish what was now due in just a couple of hours, I found that I was much more efficient with getting my tasks done, and I felt better as well. Of course, Taoism isn't just about boosting your mood or increasing your productivity. It's about growing up and getting better at it. We have cycles in just about all areas of our lives. We start young and grow old. Those we love are born and die, and we eventually follow them. Understanding these cycles can help us to accept them, and accepting them helps us to find peace. Re dop several thousand times longer than a child's life or as young as we're already, so we can easily survive, likewise. Religion is distant. Naturally, it also has its utopian depths. Religion is difficult as of today, and without garlic and oil, it is easily difficult toenzie in language and personalization or16 Sit without lens marks. These points are representations of a difficult state, and they also mornings before 42. So that would be at least a few words. Some basic things on teaching the Word at a time. ripen late. The highest notes are hard to hear. The greatest form has no shape. The Tao is hidden and without name. The Tao alone nourishes and brings everything to fulfillment. This chapter is all about the difference between how followers of the Tao appear on the outside and what is actually happening in their own internal world. Taoism is not a path that leads to great glory, at least not directly. If a follower of the Tao does gain the admiration of those around him or her, it is not intentional, but a natural result of what the Tao has led them to achieve. Much of the time, however, those who follow the Tao will find themselves the objects of incredulity and even open ridicule. I for one enjoy Lao Tzu's acknowledgement of the scoffing the Tao often attracts. Lao Tzu had a good sense of humor, and to me, I can almost hear him chuckling good-naturedly as he says, If there were no laughter, the Tao would not be what it is. Lao Tzu is not threatened or offended by the ridicule others hurl at him because of his beliefs and the way he lives his life. Instead, he has learned to take it, like all things, in his stride. He understood that the counterintuitive nature of the principles he taught were sure to invite people to laugh. Were it not so, it would not be Tao. By very nature, true principles often seem like foolishness to those who do not adhere to them. Philosophers, religious leaders, even great scientists have always been the ones who have been the most important and most important people in the world. The Tao is not a tool for the human mind to deduce the truth. Taoism has always been scoffed at for expounding true principles. When a really groundbreaking scientific discovery is made, the discoverer is often treated with contempt until it later becomes obvious through more research and experimentation that they were right. Many people are far more likely to scoff at new ideas than to try and implement them into their lives. It's little wonder that this should be the case with the Tao. To many people, it will seem that those who follow the Tao are just falling behind. This is natural, and one can see why a person would think this. After all, it is the Tao that is the most important. Taoism is the true way of life. The Tao is the tool for the human mind to follow. Taoism After all, a person following the Dao is often led by the Dao to not act at all, while everyone else around him or her is racing ahead. But when they do act, the follower of the Dao more than makes up for the previous inaction. They are like a cannon, which may take some time to load and aim, but when it is finally ready, vastly outranges other handheld firearms. Rather than frantically running around like everyone else, obsessed with the idea of quickly making visible progress so that they can be admired by their peers, they wait until the time is just right, and then, guided by intuition, they make their move, and it is clear that it was worth the wait. Although the path of the Dao really is easier in the long run, in the short term it looks excruciatingly difficult. So difficult in fact that few people will be willing to attempt it. The path of the Dao, although it steers away from unnecessary striving and action in a physical and visible sense, causes a person to have to do more. This isn't work in the way that we usually think of work, but anyone who has attempted to work on the self will not be able to deny that it is indeed its own kind of work. Learning to put aside desires and become susceptible to the pushes and pulls of the Dao requires the unlearning of ideas and habits that for most people have become almost second nature. What is the point of putting in all this work to adopt a philosophy that seems to steer one in the opposite direction of everything that we have ever been taught to value as success? To many people, this seems like utter madness. However, humble followers of the Dao find that in the long term the path of the Dao is actually much easier. All this learning and unlearning makes them more responsive and sensitive to the flow and contours of life. With this sensitivity, they are able to eliminate much unnecessary effort and striving. Thus, as they appear to be going backward, they are actually moving forward. At the same time that they may appear weak or impotent, they increase in strength. They are not concerned that their efforts do not work. They are not concerned that their efforts do not work. They are concerned that their efforts do not show on the outside, because that is not why they were in the game in the first place. The Dao gave birth to one. The one gave birth to two. The two gave birth to three. The three gave birth to all of creation. All things carry yin, yet embrace yang. They blend their life breaths in order to produce harmony. People despise being orphaned, widowed, and poor. They despise being a slave. They despise being a slave. But the noble ones take these as their titles. In losing, much is gained. And in gaining, much is lost. What others teach, I too will teach. The strong and violent will not die a natural death. The Second Isle of U Yong One of the ancient Chinese philosophical concepts at play in this chapter is the concept of yin and yang. Yin and yang is used to represent the concept of two opposite but complementary forces coming together to create one balanced whole. whole. Yin denotes femininity, darkness, mystery, passiveness, the moon, and having to do with heaven and spirits, while yang is used to denote masculinity, lightness, overtness, activeness, the sun, and having to do with the earth. In chapter 42, Lao Tzu describes yin and yang working together, or blending their life breaths, in order to produce harmony. We see examples of this all throughout nature. The alternation of sun and moon creates the cycle of one day. The blending of heat and cold produces a livable temperature. The blending of fire, as in the sun, and water, as in the rain, produces a habitable biosphere. The joining of male and female organisms enables the continuation of life. Here in this chapter, we get a bit of an example of opposite things coming together. What could be more opposite than poverty and wealth, destitution and nobility? But Lao Tzu seems to advise the quote-unquote noble ones to take on the titles traditionally despised by others. Many different philosophies and religions advise the high to make themselves low, the great to make themselves the least. Those who do this outwardly will be respected by others. Those who truly do this in their hearts will come closer to the Tao. I am not of the opinion that the way to do this is to try and lie to oneself. When we think of this concept of making ourselves low, I think we usually get the idea that this is done by talking down one's accomplishments. But in fact, it's not just about making ourselves low. It's about putting one's self down. In my opinion, this is suboptimal for several reasons. The biggest reason, however, is that this solution puts the focus on how we view ourselves. Almost all humans simply do not have the power to view the self and evaluate the self's talents, opinions and contributions objectively. It would, of course, be desirable for us to have an accurate assessment of ourselves if we could manage it, but I just don't think we can in most cases. We are simply too biased. We will inevitably either view ourselves as a self or as a self-reliant self. We will either view ourselves as a self or as a self-reliant self. We will inevitably either view ourselves more or less valuable than we actually are. Therefore, I recommend a bit of a workaround. Instead of trying to view ourselves as less, perhaps the way to go about making ourselves low, as Lao-Tzu suggests, is to just focus on thinking about others more than ourselves, putting their needs above ours. On the other hand, there could be a different interpretation to this line. Since I don't know Chinese myself, I can't speak to how the original manuscript ought to be interpreted. But looking at several different translations, it seems to me that the original Chinese translation is more appropriate for the Chinese language than the original Chinese translation. It seems to me that perhaps we could pull a slightly different meaning out of this. Maybe the line about noble ones taking these despised titles and using them to describe themselves could be thought of not so much as a recommendation but as an observation. Many people that do not have fame or wealth think that these things would make them happy, and yet many rich and famous people feel trapped and miserable because of these things. I have heard it expressed many times by famous people that they only wish they could be anonymous again. I've also heard it said that the Chinese people are more breathing and more like a human being than they are human. It's not like that. I've heard it expressed many times by famous people that they only wish they could be anonymous again. I've also heard it said that that money makes you more of what you were to begin with. Therefore, a miserable person who acquires money only becomes more miserable, a greedy person becomes more greedy, and a cruel person becomes more cruel. I don't know if this is true or not, but either way, it is clear that many people who acquire fame and wealth find that they do not satisfy them in the way they thought they would. Thus, in losing, much is gained, and in gaining, much is lost. If you have spent any sort of time learning about Taoism, you have surely heard at least something about Wu Wei. Wu Wei is one of the most important concepts in Taoism, but is also heavily misunderstood. In this video, I want to explain what Wu Wei is, and then give you some tools to harness it in your life, and when you do, you will be shocked just how much more you are able to do. Wu Wei is a concept heavily ingrained in Taoist philosophy. It means everlasting love, and it is a concept that is often used to describe the world. action, or doing by the act of non-doing. This is not to be confused with laziness or inaction. Wu Wei is simply the ability to set aside what we think we should do, and leave ourselves open to the best course of action through our intuition. When we do this, we may be guided to wait before acting, to act in a way that seems to make no sense, or even to not act at all. Wu Wei is often referred to as non-action, because it involves ceasing our own self-appointed struggle for mastery of our situation so that we can act according to intuition instead. We make ourselves soft and still so that we can hear intuition and respond to it. Thus, even great obstacles are overcome not with force or plans or agendas, but by openness, softness, and responsiveness to intuition. This is described in chapter 44 of the Tao Te Ching. The softest thing in the universe overcomes the hardest thing in the universe. That without substance can enter where there is no room. Hence, I know the value of non-action. Teaching without words and work without doing are understood by very few. So now for the tips. Most people are not used to listening to or acting on intuition, and so this concept can often seem pretty nebulous and abstract. Well, there's no one perfect tip I can give you that will make you instantly able to master this skill, but I can give you a few pointers that might help. Although most people are not used to following intuition on a daily basis, almost everyone has experienced a gut feeling that they couldn't explain. Have you ever had a sort of hunch that you chose to follow and it ended up being right? A large part of wu wei is learning to identify and act on these hunches and urges. These urges are different from just wanting to do something, or urges like the urge to sleep or eat. These are a particular kind of thing. Often they will come as no more than a thought, which is usually accompanied by a feeling of rightness or goodness. You can't explain it, you just feel like you ought to do that thing. So, if you have a certain urge, follow them as promptly as you can. Doing this repeatedly will allow you to receive more of them, and will give you more practice at identifying them. Perhaps you will feel an urge to call a friend, to do a task, let a certain situation be, or stop a certain behavior. Again, you will know these thoughts because they will usually be accompanied by a soft feeling of just being somehow right. They will also be extremely easy to ignore if you choose to do so, and the more you ignore them, the less often they will come, and you will have to make up your mind to really dedicating yourself to following them. This is where the part about putting aside our own desires comes in. Wu Wei will often gently nudge us to do things that we don't want to do. We will feel that we need to do a particular thing, but may desire to do a different thing. It may seem illogical or inconvenient. Perhaps we are intent on pursuing a promotion at work, but will have the feeling to abstain. Maybe we will have a desire to do our shopping at one store, but have a feeling to go to a different one instead. May seem trivial, but they always have a purpose, even if it's not immediately discernible. Wu Wei also becomes a lot easier when we can identify the futility of endlessly chasing after the things that most people see as important. If we are able to separate ourselves from the need for money, power, and attention from others, we will be more able to respond to the pushes and pulls of Wu Wei, because we will be freed from the chains of desire that bind most people. Whatever you cannot live without controls you. You are only as virtuous, as kind, or as effective as the thing you think you need is available. If it stops being available, all bets are off. Intuition cannot guide us if we live this way. Therefore, a state of lack, or a state of determination to get what is wanted, is incompatible with Wu Wei. Our ability to utilize Wu Wei increases as we continue to let go of these things. We become more free as we do so. We do this not with ulterior motives, but because it is the only sensible thing to do. Think about, for example, how futile the pursuit of the world is to you. You are not able to do it, but you are able to do it. You are able to do it, but you are not able to do it. You are able to do it, but you are able to do it. You are able to do it, but you are able to do it. You are able to do it. You are able to do it. How futile the pursuit of money and possessions is. Consider how ridiculous it is for us to call things our own. The reality is that nothing is really ours at all. There is nothing we have that cannot be taken from us at a moment's notice without our consent. This is true of our money, our time, our possessions, our health, our bodies, our loved ones, even our lives. To call these things ours is to lay an arbitrary claim that we can neither justify nor reliably enforce. All things that we call ours are simply loaned us by the Tao, to use, but not to hold on to. We are like actors in a play, who are loaned various props to enable us to play our parts. There is simply no reason for us to go to great pains to amass extra props. They will not help us, nor will they make us happy. All the props we need to play our part will be loaned to us. Trying to get extra is a fool's errand. Doing so will cause us not only to waste our time and energy, but can cause us to miss the chance to play our part, because we are so busy gathering extra props. It is extremely difficult to hear and respond to the subtle pushes and pulls of the universe among the clamor of our own unmitigated desires. Hence the Taoist teaching of mastering our desires. Wu Wei takes a lot of practice to master, but if you can get it down, the changes to your life will speak for themselves. As for your fame and your life, which matters more? As for your life and your wealth, which? As for gain or loss, which is more damaging? He who is most endeared to something must pay dearest for it. He who has hoarded much will suffer great loss. He who knows when enough is enough saves himself from humiliation. He who knows when to stop protects himself from peril. To know this is to be long enduring. This chapter is all about the importance of understanding the power of the mind. It is all about being able to identify when enough is enough. Learning to do this is one of the most important skills for promoting satisfaction in life. This will require a great deal of changing our thought patterns, however, since most of us were raised, and indeed are guided by our own desires, to pursue wealth, recognition from others, and control over our lives. It's only natural that we should do this. These desires come from our most basic human instincts for survival. However, when you think about it, isn't it a matter of course that you should do this? Isn't your life a greater blessing than any amount of fame or money could ever be? Is there really a point in using up every spare minute of this life to acquire wealth, possessions, and recognition that will only cost more and more precious time to maintain? Acquiring something can be a gift that comes along with a curse if we are not prepared for it. Sometimes getting the thing we desire actually ends up eating our happiness away as we lose ourselves to fear of losing that thing. Daoism teaches us to learn to let go of the thing we desire. Daoism teaches us to learn to let go of the thing we desire. Daoism teaches us to learn to let go of the thing we desire. Daoism teaches us to learn to let go of the thing we desire. Even the things we already have and love. Daoism teaches us to learn to let go of the thing we desire. It's not that we get rid of them, but we hold onto them loosely, understanding and accepting that they could be taken away from us at any time. Knowing when to stop is incredibly important. Moderation protects us and keeps us safe from the dangers that come with excess. The person who knows when to stop eating is able to avoid the health risks associated with overeating. A person who knows when to stop working will not miss out on their loved ones and other lives. They will always be able to find their way to their home. Daoism teaches us to be more mindful of our own life. Learning to be content is almost more of a pleasure in the long term. A life dominated by excess can never be enjoyed for long. Excess can be exciting in the short term, but always leads to a deadening of the senses and a numbing of pleasure in the long term. Learning to be content is almost more of of a process of unlearning a lifetime of habits and thought patterns than it is learning a new skill. We have to learn to see things differently and to stop putting emphasis on the things held dear by the people around us. Definitely a large task to take on, but the Tao will teach us how to do this if we direct our awareness to it. As we get better and better at this, we will be able to reap the benefits that come from living a satisfied life. Great accomplishment seems imperfect, yet it does not outlive its usefulness. Great fullness seems empty, yet cannot be exhausted. Great straightness seems twisted. Great intelligence seems stupid. Great eloquence seems awkward. Movement overcomes cold. Stillness overcomes heat. Stillness and tranquility set things in order in the universe. As I read this chapter, the second line about great accomplishment being outlasted by its usefulness really got me thinking about the motivations we have for our work. When we do something, it's very tempting to do it from a place of trying to receive some kind of recognition for what we do. But truly great works are not achieved in this way. Some of the greatest things ever created are not attributed to anybody in particular. Think about some of the most basic and important inventions that have changed the lives of mankind. The first thing I want to do is to think about the second thing I want to do is to think about the greatest things ever created. Fire, farming, the wheel. All of these things were discovered so long ago that we no longer have any idea who invented them. And yet they were so important that we still use them today, as much or more as when they were first invented. The greatest work is done not for glory or gain, but may be done anonymously, or without any need of recognition or praise. The Tao is certainly the greatest example of this. Although all things spring from it, all of creation owes its very existence to it, the Tao never comes to us. It is not the only thing that is created. It is the greatest thing ever created. The Tao never takes any credit for what it does. Any credit it does get is given to it by somebody else, and many people never recognize its achievements at all. Yet it continues to create and organize and maintain the balance of the universe without any need to be praised for it. It does the greatest work there is, but largely does it anonymously. When we seek to immortalize ourselves by our work, we work in a way that is most likely to benefit us, rather than to benefit mankind. I've seen this a bit as a writer and a video maker. I really enjoy making these videos, and I hope that one day it will become a part of my career. Because of this, I'm often tempted to get caught up in the view counts. It's definitely hard sometimes not to lose the creative process and the striving for numbers. And don't get me wrong, the numbers are important in their own way, especially if I want to keep doing this, because it does take up quite a bit of my time, and I do have a family that needs taking care of. But I also kind of have this feeling that if I just try to focus on creating things that I think are good and beautiful, I will end up with a lot of work. And I don't know if I'll be able to do that. I don't know if I'll be able to do that. I don't know if I'll be able to do that. The numbers will take care of themselves. But it is tough. Lots of small YouTubers end up losing their unique voice completely just by doing whatever they think will get the most views, and I can totally see why. Yet our focus on doing our best work for the sake of creating something beautiful, and not for the sake of being recognized or turning a profit, sets our work free in a way. We become free to explore options that we otherwise wouldn't. We can get into the flow of creating with less risk of being blocked by our own feelings. And that's why I'm doing this. I'm not going to be a master of the world. I'm going to be a master of the world. I'm going to be a master of the world. I'm going to be a master of the world. I'm going to be a master of the world. But it is difficult sometimes. Moving on to the middle of the chapter, we get a little bit about mastery and how sometimes it really doesn't look like mastery at all. It can be hard to appreciate truly great skill when we see it. Because one hallmark of true mastery is that the master takes whatever he or she is doing and makes it look easy and effortless. True mastery isn't flashy or pretentious. Because of this, we often look at what the master does and think to ourselves, well I could do that. But what we don't see is the years we've been doing it. We don't see the things we've been doing for years. We don't see the years of dedication to the task that brought the master to that point. A master doesn't become a master by inventing some trick or creating some new method that gives him an edge. A master may do these things, but they are not the core of the mastery. The mastery comes not from tricks or methods, but from thousands of hours of painstaking dedication to the perfection of the task's fundamentals. The master has mastered the task because he or she has perfect command of the task at its most basic levels. This attention to detail about the most basic and fundamental usually creates impatience within the novice, who thinks that learning the skill is about learning the great intricacies and mysteries of the task. But the master understands that these mysteries are not mysteries at all if one has a good understanding of the fundamental truths at play. Therefore, great intelligence often appears stupid, and great mastery often seems simple. Finally, at the end of the chapter, we get a little bit about balance. The universe is held in balance partly by the perfect mixture of cold and heat. Stillness, produces coldness, and motion produces heat. This is true of our bodies, but it goes deeper than Lao-Tzu might have even known. On a molecular level, heat is produced by the rapid movement of molecules, atoms, or ions. Things get colder when these particles begin to slow down and become more still. This balance of motion and stillness brings about the balance of temperature in the world and in the universe. We can apply this law to our personal lives as well. When we are getting too heated in a conversation or in our stress levels throughout the day, the solution is to try harder to overcome the situation, but to pull back, cool down, let the dust settle a bit. Then, when we are calm, the way forward often becomes clear to us. Old aphorisms notwithstanding, we can try to fight fire with fire, but most of the time, water just works better. Conversely, if our lives, relationships, or situations have become cold and stagnant, it's probably time to get moving. In these situations, an imperfect plan executed with vigor is often better than a perfect plan put off by the sun. By keeping our enthusiasm un Archives to keep put off til tomorrow. When things have become cold and stagnant, we should take a step forward and trust that the next step will become apparent as we go. Taoists know that action and non action are two sides of the same coin, and that wu wei, or effortless action, is the ability to flip the coin to whatever side is needed in that moment. Thus, with a blend of tranquil inaction and action taken with trust in the universe, our lives are kept in balance and nothing is left undone. The yeah-we can change the traps but we can't change the rules of direction at all. When the Tao is present in the universe, the horses will manure. When the Tao is absent from the universe, warhorses are bred outside the city. There is no greater sin than desire, no greater curse than discontent, no greater misfortune than wanting something for oneself. Therefore, he who knows that enough is enough will always have enough. There is a lot to break down in this chapter, but I do want to go ahead and focus on some wording in the last half. It's interesting to note the use of the word sin to describe desire. The use of the word sin is actually pretty consistent throughout several different translations. Translations that do not use the word sin use other words including crime, fault, or guilt. A lot of times we tend to try to avoid using words like sin or evil, when we're speaking about Taoism, but I think it can be helpful to break down what is really being meant here. We often think of the word sin in a sort of accusatory sense, like a person who commits a sin is a bad person. However, I've heard from multiple sources that the word in both Hebrew and Greek, which English translations of the Bible render as sin, literally means to miss the mark, like when shooting an arrow or throwing a spear. I have seen some disagreements, and since I speak neither Hebrew nor Greek, I can't say for sure either way. But it is an interesting perspective. Rather than seeing a sinner as a person who is inherently bad, perhaps we are better off to view sins as mistakes. Sadly, there probably are some people out there consciously making decisions to hurt others. However, I think the vast majority of people don't have these kinds of intentions. Most of us want to be good people. We all make mistakes. But these mistakes, in my opinion, are often just that, mistakes. We miss the mark. We have good intentions, but in the application of those intentions, we misstep. If the word sin still bothers you, consider what the text is saying. There is no greater sin than desire. If you want to draw another parallel with sin in the Western sense, consider the seven deadly sins. Lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, pride. You could make the case that all of these sins originate from our failure to rein in our desires, our weakness in putting our needs and wants first, our tendency to separate ourselves from the rest of the world and to try and elevate ourselves above it. Sin is separation. It is any thought, word, or action that separates us from our source, the Tao, from oneness with all things. Our failure to gain oneness with the Tao is not due to our not being on some list of saints, but rather due to our not being on some list of saints. Our failure to gain oneness with the Tao is not due to our not being on some list of saints, but rather due to our not being on some list of saints, but rather due to our not being on some list of saints, but rather due to our not being on some list of saints, but rather due to our not being on some list of saints, but rather our failure to act in accordance with oneness. The Tao is the very embodiment of oneness with all things, and in order to be one with it, we must abandon our acts of separation. When we inevitably fail to do this, we can think of it as a sin, not a deed that makes us somehow bad or wrong, but as another instance of having missed the mark. While our acts of separation will always separate us from Tao, our lives can be seen as our journey toward finding greater oneness with Tao. As we draw closer to Tao, it will make our sins of separation apparent, and we will have the opportunity to cast them aside if we choose to do so. The last line of the chapter is also instructive. Therefore, he who knows that enough is enough will always have enough. But how much is enough? How do we know when we have enough? Enough can mean different things to different people. A person who is used to three square meals a day might panic at the prospect of having only one meal a day. But if we have enough, we will have enough. But for a person who has never had a consistent meal in their life, one guaranteed meal every day seems almost too good to be true. Surely then, enough is not so much about how much of something we have, but about how much we think we need. Therefore, we are in the driver's seat when determining whether or not we have enough of something. The person who is able to reconcile their perception of enough is a happy person indeed. Without opening your door, you can know that you are not alone. You can know the whole world. Without looking out your window, you can understand the way of the Tao. The more knowledge you seek, the less you will understand. The master understands without leaving, sees clearly without looking, accomplishes much without doing anything. There is a big difference between knowledge and wisdom. We tend to think of knowledge and wisdom as being largely the same thing, but they are not. Knowledge is the accumulation of information. Wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge with good judgment. Knowledge is knowing about things, but wisdom is the ability to understand and wholesomely interface with them. There are extremely intelligent people who are not wise, and there are extremely wise people who are not all that intelligent. Knowledge will not make us wise. Actually, knowledge can work against wisdom if we are not careful. Albert Einstein once said, Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking. The other problem with acquiring too much knowledge without also acquiring wisdom is the danger of our starting to think that we know everything. Few things are more detrimental to the acquisition of wisdom than pride. Pride puts the brakes on wisdom, and strangles our ability to respond to intuition. A prideful person cannot be taught by the Tao, because a prideful person does not think that he or she needs it. Humility and wisdom go hand in hand. We often think that wisdom comes from the collection of many different types of exceptional life experiences, but this also isn't true. Wisdom and life experiences are available to anyone, whether they have the means to travel or not. It is not necessary for us to comb the world in search of experience and wisdom. This is because true wisdom comes not from other people or things, but from Tao. We come to be truly wise by pursuing humility, quietness and openness of mind, and by listening to the Tao. Immanuel Kant, one of the most influential philosophers of the Enlightenment, famously never left the city limits of his small German town. And yet his theories were immensely instrumental in the construction of modern philosophy. You may agree or disagree with Kant on numerous things, but it is hard to ignore the philosophical breadth of his work. All from a person who literally never got more than 10 miles away from his house. If you are interested in cultivating greater wisdom, the place to start is not in books, in travel or in the meeting of other people. These things can append your knowledge, if you can properly apply them. But if you are interested in becoming wise, the thing to do is to start carving out regular time to interface with Tao. Meditation is a great way to do this. If you are religious, you can use prayer. Open your mind. Open and honest contemplation also yields good results, just as long as you remain open to being taught by Tao. To learn, one accumulates day by day. To study Tao, one reduces day by day. Through reduction and further reduction, one reaches non-action, and everything is acted upon. Therefore, one often wins over the world through non-action. Through action, one may not win over the world. Do you guys remember Apple under Steve Jobs? Like at the time of the iPhone 4? Do you remember the sense of magic that surrounded Apple and their products? Maybe you were never an Apple fan, and that's fine. But for those of you who were, Apple, especially at that time, had this sort of charm about them. In a lot of ways, I think it was this sort of inherent charisma the companies seemed to have, that sold their products more than the actual products themselves. And in a big way, I think this sense of charisma came from the simplicity and lack of excess that characterized an Apple product. They just felt so clean and minimal. In a world of increasingly escalating technological complexity, Apple's products felt like a breath of fresh air. They had all the features you wanted, and none that you didn't. The interface was uncluttered and easy to navigate. The hardware was black, white, or gray. Period. The lure of Apple products was almost less about what they had, and more about what they didn't. Similarly, in our lives, some of our greatest achievements come from doing nothing at all. However, we live in a world where we are taught that our greatest impact comes from what we do. We attend colleges, seminars, and workshops to learn how to do what we do better. But consider the great value that can be provided from doing nothing. The best jokes are told by not trying too hard to be funny. The best solutions to problems are often not found during brainstorm sessions, but when one isn't thinking about the problem at all, like when you're showering or taking a nap. An argument can be avoided or stopped in its tracks by saying nothing. Some things do inherently require effort to accomplish, such as doing a job at work. But even in these cases, the best work is often done when a person isn't trying too hard, or when time is taken to find the best solution before acting. Action and non-action go hand in hand and are supported by one another. There is another translation of Chapter 48 of the Tao Te Ching, which I read at the beginning of the video. This translation renders the first two lines of the chapter like this. One who seeks knowledge learns something new every day. One who seeks the Tao unlearns something new every day. Unlearning is definitely an important part of coming near to Tao. In order to become one with Tao, we must discard the lessons we have learned throughout life that have contributed to our separation from Tao and from all things. Some of these lessons we were aware of learning, and others we learned without our realizing it. While many of these things happened outside of our control, we now have the ability to unlearn them. This is mostly done by focusing on coming closer to the Tao. As we come to know the Tao better, we will increasingly become aware of all the ways in which we are not currently like it, and we will have opportunities to be taught a better way. The Way, with a capital W. This way is found by putting aside our desires, working softness and quietness into our days and into our attitudes, and by being responsive to the pushes and pulls of our intuition. As we do this, learning and unlearning will come naturally. And so will doing and non-doing. The Way, with a capital W. The sage has no mind of his own. He is aware of the needs of others. I am good to people who are good. I am also good to people who are not good. Because virtue is goodness. I have faith in people who are faithful. I also have faith in people who are not faithful. Because virtue is faithfulness. The sage is shy and humble. To the world, he seems confusing. Others look to him and listen. He behaves like a little child. What makes a good person? This is a pretty tricky question to answer actually. Not least because it's kind of hard to get everyone to agree on what exactly a good person is. Obviously, there are going to be as many different opinions about this as there are people in the world. However, in this video, we are going to look at this question through the lens of Taoism, and more specifically, what is written in the Tao Te Ching, Chapter 49. Now, in Taoism in general, we usually try to be pretty careful about labeling things as good and bad, because we understand that our limited perspectives are terribly inadequate for ascertaining the goodness or badness of most things. We respect the fact that people and issues are complex and far-reaching, and that we see only the tiniest sliver of truth when we look at anything, because of the limitations of what we can understand. However, we cannot say that Lao Tzu, the alleged author of the Tao Te Ching, didn't recommend the cultivation of certain attributes over others. The Tao Te Ching is packed full of advice on how we ought to act, but more importantly, how we ought to become if we want to maximize our own peace, as well as our positive impact on the world. Looking at the first few lines, we are given a clue as to how Lao Tzu might have described a quote-on-quote good person. The sage has no mind of his own. He is aware of the needs of others. One of the main principles of Taoism is the cultivation of the ability to let go. To let go of the self and the desires of the self, and to embrace oneness with all things. But what does it mean to embrace oneness with other people? Does this mean that we take their opinions and attitudes as our own? Do we strive to copy and emulate them? It may be easy to mistake the emulation of others as oneness with others, but this is not true. In fact, it is not only untrue, but impossible. Let's follow this trail of logic to where the emulation of others would lead. If the master seeks oneness with all people, and if emulation is oneness, then the master must seek to emulate all people. However, most people are not currently in a state of oneness with all things, but in a state of separation. Therefore, if the master was to seek to attain oneness by emulating all people, the emulation of many of these people would force him to emulate a state of separation. Obviously, separation and oneness cannot coexist. Therefore, we must deduce that emulation is not the answer. Fortunately, the answer is found right here in the chapter. He is aware of the needs of others. The master achieves oneness with others not by taking on their attitudes and attributes as his own, but by taking their needs as his own. He makes their needs just as important as his. To him, they become one and the same. His interests are conflated with their interests. This is the practical application of oneness. This is also the definition of love in its purest and truest sense. To have true love for another person is to make their needs your needs. It is to give them what they need the most, even when they deserve it the least, at great personal cost if necessary. The master also understands the principle of wu wei, or effortless action, and employs it in the meeting of his needs and the needs of others. He is well acquainted with intuition, and follows intuition to know what others' needs are and how to meet them. The goal is not to make a martyr of yourself. It is to arrive at a state of mind where you see the needs of all others as being just as important as your own. The master understands that he will not be able to meet others' needs, but he also knows that where there is a need he is able to meet, he will do so without hesitation. He does this regardless of whether or not he will be paid back for it, or whether the person seems to deserve it. He may observe a difference in types of people, but he does not treat them with any less care or goodness as a result of these differences. He even puts people in a place of trust that they may not seem to deserve. He understands that extending trust to people often has the effect of helping them to become more trustworthy. He is not ignorant of the bad in people, but he looks for the good. There are those who could live longer and yet hasten to death. Those who can live long are 3 out of 10 among the humans. Those who die young are 3 of 10. Those who could live and yet deliberately hasten to die are 3 out of 10. Why is this? Because they are too much attached to life. According to a proverb, Those who nourish their lives well travel on land, and do not encounter predators, and do not need to wear the armor. The rhinoceros cannot find the place in them to thrust its horn. The tiger cannot find the place to claw them. Why is this? Because there is no space in them for death to enter. There is a certain percentage of people who live to a ripe old age before dying. There is also a certain percentage of people who die prematurely. This percentage was probably much higher in Lao-tse's time, but again, the exact numbers are probably arbitrary. Lao-tse again uses 3 out of 10. But according to Lao-tse, there is another 3 out of 10 people whose lives could have been long and fruitful, but who never really live at all. There are lots of reasons why this can happen, but the one Lao-tse pins down in this chapter is the tendency to hold on to life. To fear death is natural. We are naturally scared of things we don't understand, and we tend to resist change. However, death is as much a part of life as life itself. Being unable to accept the reality of death puts us in a bad spot. Those who cannot reconcile themselves with death are haunted by it all throughout their lives. Therefore, those who cannot accept death are unable to escape it until it finally becomes their reality. A person who lives like this can almost be considered to have never lived at all. They have lived an entire life concerned more with dying than with living. The things that we are unable to accept are the things that we end up giving our lives over to. Whenever I talk about death and the fear of death, I always get tons of people in the comments saying that they are not afraid of death. I tend to think this about myself, actually. However, many of us do experience a serious fear of missing out in life, or FOMO. I think in a lot of ways, FOMO is another form of our fear of death. When we experience FOMO, we suffer with a feeling that we will not live our lives to their fullest before death inevitably comes to snuff them out. We may not fear the event of death per se, but we fear the deadline it sets upon our lives. We fear the absence of whatever we think will lead to a happy and fulfilling life, and we worry that these desires will never be realized in our lifetimes. FOMO is a real thing. I've certainly experienced my fair share of it. So, what do we do about it? Well, for those of you out there who are astute observers of mathematics, you will likely have noticed that, in total, this chapter has only accounted for 9 out of the 10 people. So, what about the one left over? Well, I wasn't really able to find an official answer for this, and since it seems that Lao Tzu left this last fellow out, it may be that we will have to form our own interpretation of him or her. I have seen it postulated that this last person is the only person out of the 10 who has truly reconciled his or herself with death, and is therefore able to live life with peace and satisfaction without being haunted by the inevitability of its ending. For these people, the point of life is not to prolong it, or to cram as much into it as possible, because, let's be honest, these two are kind of the same thing. These happy few are the people who are able to accept their temporality, and enjoy it for what it is, rather than wish for it to be something else. These people can still have goals and make plans, but they see these goals and plans not as stepping stones to the life that will finally make them happy, but as just another part of a journey that has happiness all throughout it. They know that pain, sadness, and difficulty are part of the ride, and that they are just the other side of the same coin that brings peace, joy, and satisfaction. They are open and ready to receive each day as it comes, and to make the most of it. Now, skipping down to the end of the chapter, I don't know if Lao Tzu meant these tigers and rhinos, and the sages had vulnerability to them, literally or not. I, for one, am not going to advise anyone to go running in front of rhinos, and I certainly won't be doing this myself. But consider the lesson that is available here, whether it is meant literally or not. The last line of the chapter seems to go like this, and I tend to kind of echo off the page when I read it. There is no space in them for death to enter. When we become overly concerned with death, we create a space for death to enter. I'm not talking about mortality and immortality. I'm talking about the relationship one has with death, or really with anything that one tries to avoid. Over the course of my life, short as it has been, I have become pretty much convinced that the most sure-fire way of causing something to happen is to desperately avoid it. Life seems to be kind of weird that way. The most insecure people have the most embarrassing experiences. The clingiest people have the hardest time forming healthy relationships. The people that try hardest to be cool become its literal opposite. The best way to ensure that you'll be up all night is to try hard to fall asleep. I could list example after example of this, but I bet you had some examples from your own life come to mind. For me, I used to agonize over the scripts that I make for these videos. I'd start at the beginning and slog my way through till the end. Especially the intro. Especially the intros of the videos would give me a really hard time. Sometimes it felt like I had to cut my way through the first paragraph with a machete. In the last month or so though, I've learned not to start with the introduction, but rather to just start writing whatever is coming to me about the chapter. When I run out of things to say about that thing, I simply move to the next thing and write everything that comes to me about that. Suddenly I look over the document and realize that I've got a nearly finished script. From there, all I have to do is wrap it up at the end and slap an intro on the front. Turns out it's more than just a script. It's much easier to write an introduction when I've already written the thing I'm introducing. In YouTube, it's supposed to be really important to have a good intro that hooks your audience, but I've found that my intros tend to be way better when I let go of writing the perfect intro. I'm sure that you've seen a similar example of this principle in your own life. That which we resist will only persist. That which we accept ceases to have power over us. Fear of death and fear of missing out are real, and I don't mean to make light of something that is usually taken pretty seriously. But if we can learn to accept death and make the most of the lives that are currently in front of us, we will find that we, too, have no place in us for death to enter. All things arise from Tao. They are nourished by virtue. They are formed from matter. They are shaped by environment. Thus the ten thousand things all respect Tao and honor virtue. Respect of Tao and honor of virtue are not demanded, but they are in the nature of the person. They are in the nature of things. Therefore, all things arise from Tao. By virtue, they are nourished, developed, cared for, sheltered, comforted, grown, and protected. Creating without claiming. Doing without taking credit. Guiding without interfering. This is primal virtue. Those of you who have followed this series pretty closely may have noticed this chapter honors the concept of virtue, while in previous videos we have spoken of virtue as sort of a slightly less optimal substitute for following Tao, and I'm thinking more specifically about the chapter 38 video. This is due to my own mistake in using the word virtue, even where the actual text of chapter 38 uses the word goodness. This might be hair-splitting to be honest, but although the words virtue and goodness do have largely the same definitions if you were to look them up in the dictionary, we're using them here to refer to completely different concepts. The virtue that I refer to in chapter 38, which I really ought to have called goodness to stay consistent with the text, is a person's own ideas of what is right and wrong. The virtue referred to in this chapter is something different. It all gets even more confusing when we notice that other translations of chapter 38 translate goodness as virtue. Sure makes me wish that I could read Chinese. If anyone does have a knowledge of the different words in Chinese used for these different concepts, I would love to hear about it. However, for our purposes, just know that in chapter 51, we are dealing with virtue in the sense of what is meant by tei, as in Tao Te Ching, or the classic book of the way and virtue. This virtue is more than just people's ideas of right and wrong. The chapter tells us that all things are nourished by virtue. Later, it says that all things are nourished, developed, cared for, sheltered, comforted, grown, and protected by virtue. Obviously, individual people's ideas of right and wrong in and of themselves do not have the power to do this. Therefore, there must be, amongst all the ideals, prejudices, constructs, and theories of mankind, some overarching form of objective goodness and rightness. From how it's described in the chapter, it almost feels like this virtue is not only a description of certain kinds of behavior, but a force in and of itself, since it has the power to act on the 10,000 things of its own accord. Perhaps this is the primal virtue to which Lao Tzu was referring. The universe had a purpose. It was a beginning. This beginning is the mother of all. When you know the mother, you know her children too. When you know the children, go back to be with the mother, and throughout your life, you will suffer no harm. Close the passageways, lock the entryways, and throughout your life, you will not get worn out. Open the passageways, multiply your concerns, and throughout your life, you will not be saved. If you see the insignificant things, you have discernment. If you can remain flexible, you are strong. Use the rays, and return to the source of light. Do not be the cause of your own distress. This is the way of practicing the constant. Okay, there is a lot to talk about in this chapter, and I am considering making this one a two-part, since I don't have time today to break down the whole chapter. But with that in mind, I do want to talk a little bit about this middle section. This is the middle section. In looking at several different translations, we see that the part about closing the passageways refers to limiting our sensory input, or the amount of things we allow ourselves to experience and engage with. This could be thought of as unnecessary busyness, constant stimulation, or even a vulnerability to the opinions of others. There are so many things to be and do in this life, but that does not mean that we can or should be and do all of them. Even with good things, we need to know how to say enough is enough, so that we can keep room for the best things, and even a little bit of nothing at all. In order to experience Wu Wei and flow in our lives, it is absolutely essential that we are able to hear and act promptly on intuition, and one of the strongest roadblocks to intuition I know of is allowing ourselves to be saturated in the stream of sense experience that flows around the world at all times. There is a quote that says, There is never a time when new distraction will not show up. We sow them, so several will grow from the same seed. The same person also said, Measure your life. It cannot contain so many distractions. Whoever said this must have lived in a time with a lot of distractions. Maybe this is a pretty recent person. Oh, wait, these quotes are actually from Seneca. You know, like first century AD Seneca. If Seneca felt like there was too much distraction going around in the Roman times, I wonder what he would say about our current state of affairs. Now more than ever, we are in desperate need of moderation in our lives. We need to learn to shut the doors and to give ourselves time not to be distracted by anything. We need time to think, to process, to really feel difficult emotions instead of shutting them out. We need time to hear the hum of the universe, to feel what intuition is saying. Doing this will help safeguard us from burning out. It will help save us from ourselves. The beginning of the universe is the mother of all things. Knowing the mother, one also knows the sons. Knowing the sons, yet remaining in touch with the mother, brings freedom from the fear of death. Keep your mouth shut, guard the senses, and life is ever full. Open your mouth, always be busy, and life is beyond hope. Seeing the small is insight. Yielding to force is strength. Using the outer light, return to insight. And in this way be saved from harm. This is learning constancy. Okay, even though we did cover this chapter yesterday, I wanted to revisit it to cover some of the things we weren't able to talk about. Whenever I do this, I like to use a second translation so that we can look at the text through a different light. I really like the line at the end of the chapter that instructs us to use the outer light, but return to insight. To me, this passage is differentiating between what we can see by looking outside of ourselves, and what we can see by looking within ourselves. The translation we used in yesterday's video says, Use the rays and return to the source of light. It seems like we are differentiating between physical rays of light and the source that has created all light, and makes available all wisdom and insight, by which of course I mean the Tao. We get a bit more about the Tao's role as the source of all knowledge and wisdom in the beginning of the chapter. The Tao is the mother of all things and so has created all things. Because the Tao has created all things, it truly knows all things, better than even they know themselves. We usually seek to understand people by reading about psychology or taking courses on how to understand or manage people. But the best way to truly come to understand people is to go to the thing that created them. People's understanding of people cannot compare with the Tao's understanding. If people understood people perfectly, then wouldn't we all agree on how they work and why they do what they do? However, not even those who we consider experts agree on all these points. People are prone to misinterpretation, prejudice, and errors in judgment, but Tao is not. People will see a small sliver of truth, build up an entire way of thinking around this sliver of truth, and then set out trying to convince everyone that their way of thinking about things is the best way. Tao not only sees and understands all truth, it is the very embodiment of truth itself. But despite this, it does not try to win other people over to its way of thinking. Those who earnestly and sincerely seek truth are always welcome to find it with Tao, and it does not turn them away. But those who do not desire to find truth are not compelled to do so. The Tao is where all truth is available, and thus we are encouraged to While the understanding of people will yield great benefits, we must not make knowledge an end in and of itself. At the end of the day, the only thing that will bring harmony, peace, and safety is our connection with Tao, and so we are encouraged to make that our number one priority. If I possess even the smallest bits of wisdom, I would walk the Great Way, and my only fear would be in straying from this great road. The Great Way is wide and the going is easy, but how people seem to prefer the side paths. When the offices of government, the palaces and temples are richly adorned and lavishly outfitted, when the ministers are concerned chiefly with pomp and display, the fields will be dusty and overgrown with rank weeds, and the granaries of the land will be bare. The gentry wear elaborately rich embroidered clothes, eat and drink in excess with their sharp swords at their sides. These are surely the robber barons. This is not in keeping with the Way. You do not need to be wise or educated to follow Tao. All you need to be is humble, soft, open to intuition, and courageous in following a path that sometimes will seem not to make any sense. In the world we live in, it is often taken for granted that the more intelligent a person is, the better their prospects in life will be. Laozi, however, does not subscribe to this idea. Following the Way is not complicated. It does not require great intelligence. It is actually incredibly simple. Let go of your desires and plans for what you think should happen. Respond to the pushes and pulls of intuition. Contrary to how it may sometimes seem, this path is actually incredibly easy. The only thing that makes it difficult is our inability to put aside our ideas of what we want to do, or what should happen in our lives. The only thing that can get in our way is ourselves. As a human race, we are naturally inclined to follow our instincts for planning, striving, and ambition. The Way is plain and simple, but our instincts are not. Our own nature constantly calls us off to side paths that lead nowhere. We think that we can find shortcuts to the path, or that there is some treasure hidden on a side path that cannot be gained through our following the Way. However, if we follow these paths, we discover, sooner rather than later if we're lucky, that the promises of the side paths were all smoke and mirrors. At this point, the only way to get back on track is to find our way back to the path from which we strayed. It will require turning around, a forsaking of the goals and ambitions that we held so dear, and that we thought we could achieve by choosing another way. Sometimes, following the path of the doubt requires us to give up some desires completely. However, often, and only if we are able to fully let go of them, we find somewhere down the road that they come to pass anyway, often in ways that were better than we could have done ourselves, or through means that we never could have predicted. Moving on in the chapter, we are warned about the dangers of becoming too focused on outward appearances. If we spend time and effort on activities and activities that are meant to impress others, we will lose out on time and energy that could go towards addressing the things in our lives that really matter. If we become too focused on impressing others, we may be led to pursue this goal at the expense of these others that we are trying to impress. This is separation. Separation runs contrary to the way of the Tao, which is for all things to become one with Tao and one with each other. Seeking to impress others is a symptom of separation, because it shows a focus on the separateness of us and them. If we are truly one with another person, there is no need to try and impress them. Certainly the desire to impress others is a natural human instinct, and learning not to do so will take time. However, as we put our own desires aside and learn to follow the way, we will find how easy and natural this can come, when we are in harmony with Tao. Well planted, not uprooted. Well embraced, never lost. Descendants will continue the ancestral rituals. Maintain oneself, Thay becomes real. Maintain the family, Thay becomes abundant. Maintain the community, Thay becomes extensive. Maintain the country, Thay becomes public. Maintain the world, Thay becomes omnipresent. Therefore, through self, contemplate self. Through family, contemplate family. Through community, contemplate family. Through country, contemplate country. Through world, contemplate world. How do I know the world? Like this. When people set out to try and do good, they often start right away by rolling up their sleeves with dreams of changing the world. This is a serious mistake. Note the order prescribed in this chapter of the Tao Te Ching for dealing with Thay, or virtue. First comes the self. Before we are bothered with the virtue, Before we are bothered with the virtue of anyone or anything else, we first need to be concerned with the virtue of the self. We take full responsibility for our own self. We work to bring our own self as in line with Tao as possible. If we skip this step and head straight for the others, disaster is sure to follow. We simply cannot reliably effect lasting positive change on anyone or anything without first being in harmony with Tao ourselves. If we are not in line with Tao, our efforts to benefit the world and the world to come will be in vain. We are not in line with Tao. We are not in line with Tao. If we are not in line with Tao, our efforts to benefit the world are pointless, often even harmful. However, as we draw closer to Tao and come into harmony with it, we become changed by it. As this occurs, we will become natural embodiments of Thay, or virtue. We will do good things, not because we are trying to, but as a natural result of who we are. Because of this, our virtue will naturally have positive effects on those around us. As more and more individuals do this, families, communities, nations, and eventually, the world will abound in Thay. This is not the result of any person's righteous crusade, but of millions and billions of individuals coming into harmony with Tao on their own personal journeys. Will this ever happen to the world? To be honest, I don't know. I guess the point I'm trying to get across here is that the best thing that we can do to try and change the world is to come into harmony with Tao ourselves to the greatest degree we possibly can. Only by doing this will we be able to positively effect our families, then our communities, and all the way up to the world. In all my study of history and human behavior, I am becoming more and more convinced that no government, no laws, no institution can solve the problems caused by a deficiency of Thay among the people they govern. It's kind of like how they say you can't exercise enough to compensate for a bad diet. I don't think that you can govern enough to compensate for a populace's tendency to choose greed, ambition, pride, and fear over oneness and harmony. Any system that tries to do so will not succeed. Now remember, at the end of the day, I'm not a political scientist. I'm not a professional anything, really. I'm just a guy with a computer that likes Taoism. If you also have a computer and also like Taoism, I think that you would also like my Discord. Every time I put one of these videos out breaking down a chapter of the Tao Te Ching, I open up a thread for discussion about the chapter. It's a great place to learn, get different perspectives, and find other cool people who are passionate about philosophy. pois and snakes do not sting him. Savage beasts don't attack him. Birds of prey don't pounce on him. His bones are soft and his muscles weak, but his grasp is firm. He knows nothing yet of mating, but his organ stirs, for his vigor is at its height. He will cry all day, but his voice will remain loud, for his harmony is at its height. If you know harmony, you know what is constant. If you know what is constant, you are enlightened. If your mind forces your breath, you misuse your strength. You misuse your strength. What expands too much is bound to collapse. This is not the way of Tao. What goes against Tao soon declines. There are many instances in the Tao Te Ching of Lao Tzu taking inspiration from infants. Actually, this is a common theme in many other philosophies and religions as well. Many of these regard the infant as pure and innocent, and they propose that later problems develop from experiences and influences. The child is exposed to as it matures. These schools of thought often parallel the process of self-actualization as returning to the innocence and inherent goodness of the child, while maintaining the wisdom and perspective that were gained along the way. It is interesting also to note the nature of the human life cycle. When a human is born, it progresses gradually from lack of activity and total dependence on others, to abundance activity and relative physical independence. Then, as it nears the end of life cycle and becomes old, increasingly begins to revert back to less activity and increasing physical dependence on others. Perhaps this is a physical manifestation within the human life cycle that we can learn from. While there are many aspects of childhood that we necessarily leave behind as we mature, there are aspects that perhaps we would do well to adopt all throughout our lives. Lao Tzu highlights several of these throughout the chapter. Starting with the beginning of the chapter, it does seem a bit odd to claim that newborn babies are not attacked by wild animals. When we see a new child, the child is never attacked. It is not a child that is attacked by wild animals. It is a child that is not attacked by wild animals. It is a child that is not attacked by wild animals. When we see a new child, the child is not attacked by wild animals. When we see a new child, the child is not attacked by wild animals. While theे are the early Koch girls, we do note that the adult vehicles are not attacked by wild animals. In reality, we can wean off alot of them. Also allows us to downplay the idea of the human life cycle. That is why we are still<|mi|>n taking care of them. So, it is like saying, when we are in the middle of a war on universal and active mastery, that as an adult, the individual WAITS to take such a big time and need some freedom, as we will later do in a different chapter when we can learn about the history of voices of adopted children. It doesn't mean that the new life cycles that I mentioned, are intersections of the purer and innocent mind of a child. These are all certainly possible explanations. and I don't know that there really is any way to say for sure what Lao Tzu meant by this, although to me the second explanation does seem especially plausible. I've also seen people say that perhaps Lao Tzu was just engaging in a bit of wishful thinking, but I do personally find this idea pretty unlikely, since Lao Tzu is so characteristically concerned with observing the universe as it is, and not as the self wants it to be. If you'll indulge me, I think I might venture so far as to add a theory of my own. If you think about it, while some infants do perish to wild animals, and certainly this would have been much more common in Lao Tzu's time, many do not. In fact, I think it would be pretty fair to say that the majority do not. What is the reason for this? Among other things, it is because they are able to count on the protection of individuals stronger and more capable of dealing with these dangers than they are. In the infant's case, this usually takes the form of parents, but in the lives of us adults, I am inclined to assign this protectoral role to the children of Lao Tzu. Babies don't try to train with weapons or kung fu or build elaborate houses to protect themselves from animals, firstly because they are incapable of doing these things, and secondly because they are able to depend on others who are capable of these tasks. Similarly, while we adults are capable of defending ourselves from wild animals, there are many dangers out there that just kind of happen to us, and we are more or less powerless to fight, such as disease, famine, civil unrest, economic conditions, and many others. While we adults are capable of defending ourselves from wild animals, while modern developments in medicine, government, and economics strive to overcome these challenges, they will probably never go away completely. While I'm not suggesting that we live with our heads in the sand, I do believe that there is a lot of the world that is just out of our control. Therefore, rather than constantly worry about persistent dangers that we can do very little about, I think we are much better off trusting these things to the universe, and concerning ourselves primarily with following our intuitions and drawing closer to Tao. Paradoxically, our resolve to do this is to be able to do this in a more positive way, and to be able to do this even in the face of growing global concerns may even be the thing that allows us to act in ways that will go great lengths in solving the problems that we would otherwise be worrying about. People who are in harmony with Tao will do good and overcome opposition naturally. People who concern themselves too much with complex problems act in fear and self-preservation, and tend to only make these problems worse. As in so many areas of life, the only way to really be free from these problems is to first let them go. Once we have done this, we will be in a position to really be able to overcome these problems. We will be in a position to really do something about them, if that's what our intuitions inspire us to do. Striving for solutions is not the answer. Being in harmony with Tao is the answer. This harmony will foster solutions naturally, but in order for this to happen, we need to make harmony the goal. The chapter says, If you know harmony, you know what is constant. If you know what is constant, you are enlightened. The world does not need more extensively thought out programs or agendas. The world needs more enlightened individuals. If you're following the path of the Tao, you are in a position to really do something about them, and you are in a position to really do something about them. If you're following the channel closely, I know that I keep coming back to this theme, and I do apologize if it's getting redundant. I guess it's just been on my mind a lot lately. Those who know do not talk. Those who talk do not know. Keep your mouth closed. Guard your senses. Temper your sharpness. Simplify your problems. Mask your brightness. Be at one with the dust of the earth. This is primal union. This is primal union. He who has achieved this state is unconcerned with friends and enemies, with good and harm, with honor and disgrace. This, therefore, is the highest state of man. You know, it's funny. As I looked at a few different translations for this chapter, so many of them kept the wording of the first two lines almost exactly the same. It's almost like nobody felt like this idea could be any better worded than the way that it is. Those who know, do not talk. And those who talk, do not know. While we maybe do not always state this outright, we all feel this intuitively. We feel the insecurity of someone who can't stop talking. We often smell their incompetence through all the flowery language. Those who truly know do not do this. They have nothing to prove to anyone else. They don't have to assert that they know things. They know that they know things. So what is the point in trying to prove it to anyone else? On a more personal note, this is something that I would like to talk about in the next chapter. This is something that I'm trying to work on in my own life. I do recognize the irony of having a whole channel of me talking about chapters of the Dao De Jing like this one that say don't talk too much. I'm kind of trying to figure out where that middle ground is. Lao Tzu himself wrote the Dao De Jing, but when we read the Dao De Jing, it is extremely concise. He focuses on saying a lot with only a few words. This kind of goes contrary to how that YouTube algorithm is supposed to work. With the algorithm, the two most important things are supposed to work. The first is the algorithm itself. It has to be click-through rate, which is the percentage of people that see your videos and choose to click on them. And watch time, which is how much time people spend watching your videos. Therefore, there's part of me that feels like I should be making these videos as long as possible to maximize my watch time, and there's another part of me that feels like this is kind of contrary to Lao Tzu's formula. Then there is another very real part of me that recognizes that there's only a certain amount of work that I can sustainably put into these videos without becoming consumed by them and going insane. And inevitably, that part of me, ends up dipping the balance. So the new balance that I've personally come to is to try and make sure that when I write these scripts, I write them until I don't have anything else to say. When I feel like I've covered the topics efficiently, I don't try and fluff up the videos with extra material. I just slap together an intro and ending and call it good. And honestly, writing is a lot more fun this way. And if this is going to be something that I'm going to do long term, I think it needs to be something that I find enjoyable. But I digress. Moving on in the chapter, let's take a look at the second paragraph. The first paragraph is a little bit more interesting. It's a little bit more interesting than the first one. Keep your mouth closed. Guard your senses. Temper your sharpness. Simplify your problems. Mask your brightness. Be at one with the dust of the earth. This is primal union. These lines can serve as kind of a loose framework for achieving the state of primal union. Some of these items have to do with monitoring your output. Keep your mouth closed. Mask your brightness. Don't try to be the center of attention. Just play whatever part you're called to play in things. Be content with observing events as they unfold and only act when it is time for you to act. There is also advice here for monitoring our input. Guard your senses. Don't get caught up in unnecessary distractions. There are many good things to learn and observe, but there is also a lot in the world that is just noise. Cut out the noise as much as you can. Live in the world, but choose your influences carefully. Take time to be quiet and be alone with yourself. Ponder and meditate often. Eliminate excess distractions so that you can easily hear and respond to intuition. Use meditation to cut out the excess noise in your own thoughts. The last section describes the benefits and attributes of the state of primal union. One who has achieved primal union does not live for the approval of others. They don't hold onto things. They accept that quote-unquote bad things and quote-unquote good things will both happen to them, and they don't try to prevent one or hold onto the other. They follow their intuitions and keep a loose grip on their plans and goals, always ready to let go of them if need be, because they trust that the universe ultimately has a better plan for their lives than they could ever make for themselves. This is the goal of Taoism. This is the state for which we all aim. The more ingenious and clever men are, the more strange things happen. The more rules and regulations, the more thieves and robbers. Therefore, the sage says, I take no action and people are reformed. I enjoy peace and people become honest. I do nothing and people become rich. I have no desires and people return to the good and simple life. In my study of history, one common theme that I have often seen in many of the revolutions that have occurred around the world is that things so often get escalated by those who are in power taking too hard a line on some matters. Things can all be going great, maybe the people are putting together a peaceful petition for reform, and suddenly the king snaps and cracks down way harder than necessary. The populace predictably retaliates and things spiral out of control. One classic example of this is Charles Stuart of England, who is so inflexible and uncooperative that he more or less forced his subjects to execute him against their will, out of sheer obstinacy. As a parent of small children, I have really begun to see these issues of freedom versus authority come to the point. As a parent, it is my job to protect my kids and to enable them to live positive and constructive lives when I'm gone and they've moved on. I cannot do this without having some sort of structure for establishing boundaries, and teaching them appropriate skills and behavior. For me not to do this would be against their best interests. However, it is also not in their best interests to crush their sense of freedom, autonomy, and personal power. This is a difficult balance to learn as a parent, to say the least. When faced with one of these distinctions, a question I have often asked myself is, what freedom can I give my kids? Or, what can I say yes to? Often as parents, we get to a place where we just say no offhand without really considering. There are times when I have told my kids no about something, only to realize upon further reflection that I really probably could have told them yes. This doesn't mean that I'd tell them yes to everything. Setting healthy boundaries for your child is an important part of being a parent. But I do try to make sure that when I say no, I have a good reason for it. One of the hardest things about parenting is learning not to get caught up in power struggles. A lot of times, if you honestly self-evaluate, you'll be able to differentiate between the times when you insist upon something because it's a boundary and it's for your child's own good, and times when you insist upon something because you feel the need to assert your dominance as a parent. Now, don't get me wrong, I do believe that kids should be taught to respect or at least obey their parents. Not necessarily as a service to the parent, but because learning respect for authority is a part of life, and they will need to understand at least a measure of this in order to get along in the world. But I also believe that the kind of authority figure I represent to them as a child will influence their relationship with authority down the road. As they look back on their childhood, will they remember a parent who lovingly corrected them, and was stern with them when necessary in order to facilitate their safety and development? Or will they remember a parent who was domineering and authoritarian, who took fierce stances on matters for the sake of winning arbitrary power struggles? If I parent in this way, I am not invoking authority for my child's benefit. I am invoking it to protect my own ego, and to hide my insecurity as a parent. This is a really difficult thing to navigate as a parent. It takes a lot of time and learning, and I don't pretend that I've got it all figured out. Please remember and understand that I am not a qualified parenting expert, and this all just comes down to my own personal opinion and worldview. I guess the main point I'm trying to get across here is that when we lead people, in whatever capacity it may be, we should try to give them as much opportunity to exercise their personal freedom as possible. When situations necessitate our interference as authority figures, we need to make sure that we are interfering for the right reasons, and that everything is done from a place of love and respect, not pride, insecurity, or authoritarianism. When we lead, the Taoist principle of non-doing is super relevant. Because we find that people who are given autonomy within healthy boundaries often learn to lead themselves. If a government is unobtrusive, the people become whole. If a government is repressive, the people become treacherous. Good fortune has its roots in disaster, and disaster lurks with good fortune. Who knows why these things happen, or when this cycle will end. Good things seem to change into bad, and bad things often turn out for good. These things have always been hard to comprehend. Thus, the Master makes things change without interfering. She is probing, yet causes no harm. Straightforward, yet does not impose her will. Radiant and easy on the eye. So at the beginning of this chapter, we get a bit of a continuation on the theme of last chapter. If those who rule give their subjects autonomy and respect their rights, then things tend to go well with society. But when rulers impose harsh restrictions and seek to micromanage and establish strong degrees of control over their people, the people inevitably begin to retaliate. History has supplied us with more than enough examples of this theme. The chapter then seems to switch gears, and we get a bit on non-duality. For those of you who may not have heard this term before, non-duality, or non-dualism as it applies today, is the understanding that things that appear to be in opposition to one another often stand in a complementary relationship to each other. Another way of saying this is that many things that appear to be opposites are only two parts of the same whole. Often, we tend to think of events in our lives as being either fortunate or unfortunate, but Daoism urges us to be careful about applying such distinctions to events that we admittedly understand very little about. Daoism acknowledges that our limited perspectives are often very inadequate for identifying the goodness or badness about any given situation. Many misfortunes have the effect of causing good fortunes later down the road, and many good fortunes have the effect of eventually leading to disaster. As Lao-tzu reminds us, these things have always been hard to comprehend. Therefore, rather than holding on to some things and resisting others, we are much better to accept and try to flow with circumstances in our lives that live outside of our control. The master who understands this concept gains much. He or she discovers the ability to influence the direction of events without forcing them directly. Although the master is skilled in their art, they are also harmless. They may be dangerous in their own way, but their self-control and good nature allows them to use careful discernment in employing their talents, and they use them prudently to produce the best outcomes. Another translation of the last few lines of the chapter reads, Therefore, the sage is sharp, but not cutting, pointed, but not piercing, straightforward, but not unrestrained, brilliant, but not unyielding, and not blinding. I like the distinction of pointed but not piercing. To me, this means that the master is capable but controlled. He or she is not impotent. The master has great strength and ability, but this strength and ability is tempered by wisdom, patience, and intuition. As the master follows this intuition, they will be led to employ their abilities benevolently. In caring for others and serving heaven, there is nothing like using restraint. Restraint begins with giving up one's own ideas. This depends on virtue gathered in the past. If there is a good store of virtue, then nothing is impossible. If nothing is impossible, then there are no limits. If a man knows no limits, then he is fit to be a ruler. The mother principle of ruling holds good for a long time. This is called having deep roots and a firm foundation. The Tao of long life and eternal vision. There are are remnants of two wise men who use the power of Vanessa that are world they ownаз I can do it more properly then. The reason why I feel like this chapter is so important is because this chapter to me is the summation of everything we've talked about up to this point surrounding the concept of virtue and following the Tao. I think that this is all really, really important. So today I want to break down this chapter in pretty good detail to pull apart what's being said. So with that, let's start at the first couple lines. In caring for others and serving heaven, there is nothing like using restraint. In this particular translation, we talk a little bit about restraint. Another word that comes up in a lot of other translations is moderation. Whichever word you prefer to use, we are talking about the concept of not going too far, not trying too hard, not pushing your own agendas too extremely. We're talking about wu-wei, about acceptance, the ability to discern between the time to act and the time to merely observe. The chapter tells us that developing restraint is a process of developing a certain type of restraint. The term restraint starts with the ability or the determination to give up one's own ideas when necessary. This doesn't mean that we can never have goals or plans, but it does mean that we are quick to let go of them when a situation calls for it, and that we are intuitive and discerning enough to know when this is necessary. We may have our own ideas or agendas, but we do not remain attached to them. We hold them loosely and quickly and easily discard them when the situation calls for it. The next line tells us that the ability to do this depends on virtue gathered in the past. But what does this mean? When we make a conscious decision to follow the Tao, we gather virtue. Every time we follow our intuitions bravely, we gather virtue. Many people think that we become virtuous by trying hard to do good things, or trying hard to change ourselves to become more virtuous by sheer force of will. While the path to virtue does require us to change, and while it certainly does involve our willpower, it is not quite the same thing as this. The path to virtue primarily involves being close enough to Tao to be able to do good things. But when we make a conscious decision to follow the Tao, we are not only close enough to Tao, but we are also close enough to Tao to hear our intuitions promptly and powerfully. The first step on this path is an intention to draw closer to Tao. As we make this our intention and make time for quiet contemplation and meditation, we will begin to notice our intuition starting to take effect. New ideas will begin to form in our heads. We will begin to have feelings about what we should do next. These feelings will usually be small, and often they will be easy to ignore if we choose to do so. They will also often be inconvenient and may not seem to make any sense at all. Often, they will urge us to act completely contrary to what we want to do with our own self-will. But we can recognize them because even if they don't feel like something we want to do, they will somehow feel right. Acting on these urges will cause us to act in the best ways, even if they don't seem like the best at the time. If we postpone or ignore these feelings and urges, they will start to diminish, and we may even lose them completely. However, if we follow them immediately and courageously, over time they will start to come back to us. They will start to come more often, and we will get better at understanding and interpreting them. As we continue to follow them, they will direct us to act in ways that will bring us closer to Tao. As we get closer to Tao, we will start to naturally change to become more like Tao. If you've ever felt like Wu Wei feels too nebulous or ethereal to be useful, then this is what it looks like in a practical, actionable sense. This is how to use Wu Wei in your life. This is also what is meant by virtue being gathered in the past. All of our past inclinations to follow Wu Wei as indicated by our intuitions bring us closer to Tao, which naturally causes us to increase in Tei, or virtue. This store of virtue that we have built up over time lends to us an increasing ability to give up our own desires. As we increasingly give up our desires, we are able to act on higher levels of intuitional urges. As we receive and act upon higher levels of intuition, we attain to higher levels of virtue. Higher levels of virtue allow us greater levels of giving up our own desires, and the cycle goes on and on and on until we eventually become one with Tao. And we become one with Tao because we are like Tao. The further along we are on this path, the more we realize that nothing is impossible. The more things cease to be impossible, the less we are bound by the pitfalls and limitations that impede most people. The less we are bound by human pitfalls and limitations, the more fit we are to take care of others. Our virtue and our nature becomes grounded and rooted in Tao. Our foundation is that of Tao. This is the whole point of Taoism. This is the whole point of spirituality. This is the whole point of everything. Rule a big country the way you'd cook a small fish. If Tao is used to govern the world, evil spirits have no power. Their power is not gone, but it does not harm the people. Their power does not harm the people, and it does not harm the sage. As the Tao is used to govern the world, evil spirits have no power. Their power is not gone, they suffer no harm, their virtues unite and return to them. To start our breakdown of this chapter from the Dao De Jing, I want to take and examine these first two lines. But as we look at these two lines, in order for us to be able to understand the philosophical theory, we first need to understand some culinary theory. That's right, we need to talk about how to properly fry a fish. Now, I for one have almost no experience with this whatsoever. So in preparing to write this script, I found myself falling down a rabbit hole of cooking videos and blogs. I actually found some pretty cool stuff, but there was one paragraph in particular from a blog post that caught my attention. And to be honest, I think the best thing I can do to explain what I learned would be to just read it for you guys, since it's not that long. This excerpt is from reluctantgourmet.com, and I will link the article in the description so you can go read it for yourself if you'd like. And as I read this, I would invite you to open up your philosophical ears a little bit, to try and pull out some lessons, and to try and learn a little bit more on how to govern people. So with that, here's the excerpt from the blog. Remember your mom always tells you not to play with your food? The same is true when cooking fish, or any protein for that matter. The only way you will know when it is time to turn it, is when the protein naturally releases from the pan. If you rely on a recipe's instruction to turn after three minutes, you could run into trouble. When a protein has browned nicely, it will release from the pan with minimal sticking, if any at all. Place the fish skin side first in the pan, and wait to make it brown. If it's not brown, then it's not brown. If it's not brown, then it's not brown. If it's not brown, then it's not brown. If it's not brown, then it's not brown. If it's not brown, then it's not brown. If it's not brown, then it's not brown. Until it lets you. Adjust the heat so you hear a good sizzle, but not very loud sputtering or popping, and allow the fish to cook and develop a nice sear. It takes as long as it takes, but don't walk away. You have to be ready to turn it when it's ready to give. After the first three minutes, try lifting the fish with a wide fish spatula. If it releases easily, gently turn the fish. If not, give it about another 30 seconds and try again. Please don't force it though. You shouldn't have to scrape with the spatula. Okay, so did you get any good lessons from that? For all my Discord members, I am very excited to see the discussion about this in the chapter 60 thread, because there was a lot of good stuff there. For those of you who are not in my Discord, well, come and join my Discord. It's totally free. You get the benefit of an awesome community that loves to talk about topics you're already interested in, the community gets the benefit of another perspective on said topics, and I get the benefit of having my ego boosted from seeing my server member list grow. See? Everybody gets what they want. Plugs aside though, I do want to draw your attention to the part of the paragraph where it said, it takes as long as it takes, but don't walk away. This is an excellent example of wu-wei in action. If we mess with things too much, they start to go wrong. However, wu-wei, just like frying a fish, doesn't mean you don't do anything. If we just sat there and washed our fish and never touched it at all, we would have nothing to eat at the end but a nice piece of charcoal. Frying fish and wu-wei both require action, but they require only the right kind of action. They require action that is taken only at the right moment and only the right amount, no more and no less. Notice also that the author says don't walk away. Although the chef isn't poking or prodding the fish unnecessarily, they are not away doing something else. They are still actively involved in the cooking. They are watching and observing, ready for the tell-tale signs that it's time to act. No action is taken other than the right action at the right time. A frying fish tells the story of when to flip it with outward indicators that can be observed. But sometimes, our life situations don't do this. Well, that's not exactly true. There are indicators in life to tell us when to act, but often we need to be attentive to intuition in order to pick them up. Just as the cook attentively observes the fish for signs that it's ready to flip, we must attentively observe our intuitions to be prepared for the subtle urges that beckon us to act. Moving on in the chapter, we're told that when Dao is used to govern the world, evil spirits are not able to harm others. Maybe you believe in spirits and maybe you don't. I'm not going to dive into the complicated and intricate world of Chinese spirit belief, but suffice it to say that the ancient Chinese did believe in spirits, both good and bad. They believed that they were both good and evil beings in the unseen world that could influence the Earth and people through their various powers. Whether or not you do believe in spirits, we can acknowledge that there are influences all around us to act virtuously or non-virtuously. This is one of the many problems with trying to change our behavior through force of will alone. Even if we succeed in changing a behavior, we will still have to wait for the right time to act. Even if we fail or fail, we will still have to live in existing ways. If you do not, just try to move on. Even if we succeed in changing a behavior, we often remain open to the influences that caused that behavior in the first place. Many people who have struggled with addictions have discovered that stopping a behavior is not simply a matter of abstaining from a substance or behavior, but learning to deal with the states of mind that used to prompt them to engage with that substance or behavior in the first place. If we want to really change our lives, it isn't enough just to act different. We need to really become different. Following the path of the Tao changes a person. That is one of the remarkable things about the Tao. It brings a person to a state of oneness naturally. The path to this oneness lies in following intuition. It lies in softness and stillness. Finding this path is the whole point of Taoism. A large country should take the low place like a great watershed, which from its low position assumes the female role. The female overcomes the male by the power of her position. Her tranquility gives rise to the male. Her humility gives rise to the female. If a large country takes the low position, it will be able to influence smaller countries. If smaller countries take the lower position, then they can allow themselves to be influenced. So both seek to take the lower position in order to influence the other or be influenced. Large countries should desire to protect and help the people, and small countries should desire to serve others. Both large and small countries benefit greatly from humility. Bigger countries, then, seek to destroy themselves, and eyebrow the vice. WaitED So this episode will be a bit shorter for two reasons. The first is that I don't consider myself an expert on the workings of international politics. So therefore, I don't think I ought to comment too much on what I don't know very well. The second, more pragmatic reason is that I have very little time today. I am going to need to make this video kind of short. I know, it is a bummer. Do I need to? So although I'm going to abstain from commenting too much on international politics. Either way, it pays off. going to try to look at this chapter in a more general sense, because I don't think this chapter is only useful for discussing the affairs of large countries. I think it can also be useful for our individual lives as well. In life, there are always those who are in higher positions or lower positions than others. While all people are equally important and valuable in a broad sense, not all people are equal to each other in terms of individual characteristics. For example, if you were to compare me to, say, Charles Dickens, and holy crap, please do not do that. But if you were to do that, you could say that both of our lives are equally valuable from a humanistic perspective. However, I am not equal with Charles Dickens in terms of literary talent. I'm not even on the same playing field. This doesn't make me less important than Charles Dickens, it just makes me different. Now, if you were to compare me with Charles Dickens in terms of rugby skill, it's possible that I might be superior, since, although he was purported to have been quite the long-distance walker, Charles Dickens was sickly in his youth and didn't really seem to have been one of the most important people in the world. Neither of these comparisons make Dickens or me more important, but they do make us different. We are differently suited for different purposes. Therefore, our best bet is to perform the purposes to which we are suited to the best of our abilities, and to be content with that. Now let's bring this principle back to countries. Large countries and small countries have different strengths and roles to play in the world. One is not more important than the other. If we think that one is more important, it's because we are only comparing specific characteristics, and we are not looking at the same thing. Therefore, countries, as well as people, would do well to understand the role they play in the greater scheme of the world, and to play that part contentedly. The Tao is the tabernacle of creation. It is a treasure for those who are good, and a place of refuge for those who are not. How can those who are not good be abandoned? Words that are beautiful are worth much, but good behavior can only be learned by example. When a new leader takes office, don't give him gifts and offerings. These things are not as valuable as teaching him about the Tao. Why was the Tao esteemed by the ancient masters? Is it not said, with it we find without looking, with it we find forgiveness for our transgressions? That is why the world cannot understand it. I really like these lines about how the Tao is a treasure for some and a refuge for others. The Tao is for everyone, and for those who are not living in harmony or closeness with the Tao, the Tao is for those who are living in harmony or closeness with the Tao. For those who are living a fairly actualized life, they see the value of closeness with the Tao. It becomes to them a priceless treasure that they value above all others. For those who are not currently living in harmony or closeness with Tao, the Tao calls out to them as well. It doesn't force anyone to follow it, but it softly urges all people and things in its direction if they will listen. There are those who may be farther separated from Tao, but who desire closeness with it. Maybe they don't call it Dao or the universe or God, maybe they don't call it anything. It may be that they only desire a feeling of peace and closeness, and are willing to give up their own desires and ambitions in order to attain it. Many people experience this as just a feeling that there is something more to life. The first step to finding this something is for them to either consciously or subconsciously make-up their minds to find that thing and that it is more important than any other desire or ambition they may have. They may have to give up on trying to find satisfaction and contentment in worldly pursuits and pleasures. Many people come to this point after years of trying to find happiness in their work, relationships, entertainment, substances, or behaviors, and being finally just fed up with it all. Some people find it through their respective religions, or through the pursuit of truth, or thoughtful study of philosophy and life improvement. There are as many different ways to find the path to Tao as there are people in the world. But at the end of the day, they all lead to that critical first step of letting go of one's own desires in favor of something greater than the self. When those who have not experienced the Tao begin to experience it, one of the feelings they will feel is an immense sense of relief. When we have come to experience this sense of relief, this sense of belonging and oneness, we are then in the position to help others to find it. However, often the best way to do this is to show others the path by our own examples. There is a place for words. But, as we have learned in previous chapters, words are imprecise and often inadequate for things like describing and pointing the way to Tao. I'm learning this more and more every day as I write these scripts and find how difficult it is to adequately describe my own experience with Tao in a way that can be understood and made use of. Better than words is to let people get the feel of what Tao is by seeing how we live our lives. This is certainly the most difficult way to teach. It's much easier to try and describe the way than to actually live it. However, this is the most difficult way to teach. the most effective way of teaching others. And at the end of the day, if we're not living the way ourselves, isn't all our fancy talk just that? Fancy talk? The greatest gift we can give to our leaders, or anyone really, is to set for them the example of following Tao. The beauty of this is that it's a gift that we can give just by the way we live our lives. That's what we should be doing anyway. The best examples are set by a person living a virtuous life naturally, and not to show off or to do other people good. People feel stuff like that, and nobody likes insincerity. Finally, in the last paragraph, we are told that with Tao, we find without looking and find forgiveness for our transgressions. This is another one of those sections of the Tao Te Ching that really just shows how Taoism, far from running contrary to many religions, such as Christianity for example, actually pairs with them so well. The way I see it, if you're religious, Taoism really just serves to deepen and enrich the understanding that you're a Taoist. There is so much truth out there, and you can find it in many different types of places. The funny thing about truth, so far as I see it, is that no matter where you find it, it all just seems to kind of fit together, like an ever-expanding puzzle. Whether you're religious or not, I really encourage you to go about your life collecting pieces of truth wherever you happen to meet them. Taoism, as with anything, should be a means to an end, not an end in and of itself. Learning about Taoism is not the purpose of life. The purpose of life is to become one with Tao, Source, the universe, God, whatever you want to call it. And the teachings of Taoism, at the end of the day, are just tools for doing that. But going back to the chapter, many religions have some sort of belief in forgiveness of sins. If you're religious, you probably have your own take on this already, and to that I say great. But if you're not religious, maybe I can offer a perspective to make this concept seem a little more practical. We all make mistakes. We all screw up. This is a part of life, and we accept this. But we also accept that in order to have better lives or to be better people, somewhere along the line, we have to stop making these mistakes. Our lives only change if we change. This is the whole point of self-help. Yet so often, our efforts at self-help fall short. How many unfinished diets, unread books, and uncompleted programs are there scattered throughout the pages of your life story? I know that in mine, there's a ton. We can try to change by ourselves, but at the end of the day, if we are able to change, we can change for the better. These changes are often only superficial. Thus the need for Tao, or whatever you want to call it. When we make an honest intention to get closer, or get right with Tao, a path begins to reveal itself to us, one step at a time. As we take one step, the next step becomes clear. Eventually, we follow this path until it leads us back to Tao, where real and lasting change is truly possible. That's all the time I've got for today. Just think on what we've talked about for a bit, and see if anything from it feels like something that's really important to you. I'll see you next time. This chapter has a lot to do with taking things that seem great and overwhelming and making them manageable. There are lots of times when we are confronted with tasks that seem completely overwhelming. However, often, they only seem overwhelming because we either don't understand the task, or we are making assumptions about it that are not correct. One such common assumption is that things have to be done a certain way. If you'll indulge me, there's an analogy from video games that I think is pretty applicable here. If you have any kind of experience with online multiplayer games, like Valorant, League of Legends, or Apex to name a few, you will know that in these games there is a thing called the meta. If you don't have much experience with these kinds of games, the word meta is just an acronym for most effective tactics available. The meta is a word used to describe the play styles, items, characters, and tactics that most people generally agree are optimal in the game at the current time. As the developers tweak the game from time to time, the meta tends to shift, and opinions change about how the game should be most optimally played. However, when the game Valorant first came out, I started to think that it was a good idea to make a game that was more optimal, and that it would be more fun to play. I started to think that it would be more fun to play. I started to think that it would be more fun to play. I started to think that it would be more fun to play. I saw an example of how sometimes the meta, or what everybody agreed was most optimal, was just wrong. Valorant came out back during the pandemic as a new 5v5 tactical shooting game that featured different agents, or characters a player could choose to play as. Each agent has its own unique abilities and playstyle, and contributes to a team in a different way. When the game first came out, there was a character called Jet that almost everybody agreed was terrible. Despite having really fun dashing and movement abilities, everybody thought that she just didn't want to play. She just didn't want to play. She just didn't bring enough utility to the team to be considered viable. The developers made a couple small changes to her to try to incentivize people to pick her up, but nobody was convinced. Then suddenly a few months later, players started pairing her with a gun called the Operator. Without getting too lost in the weeds here, the Operator is an extremely powerful gun that is a little high risk high reward because of how slowly it fires. However, people realized that Jett was the perfect character to use the Operator because she could get a kill with it and then dash away to safety without being killed herself, and suddenly the Jett meta was born. The funny thing is, Jett had never received any meaningful changes to her power level. In fact, today she is much weaker than she was on release, yet she remains a staple pick even at high levels of the game. It's not that Jett got stronger, it's just that people finally realized how to use her. The early meta that had dictated she was unplayable was wrong. This was an example from the gaming world, but the fact is that almost everything that people do is dominated by someone else. The meta is a meta that is not just about the game itself, but about the world as a whole. The meta is a meta that is based on the way we think, the way we eat, the way we exercise, the way we sleep, work, play, find careers, find romantic partners, speak, dance, listen to music, even the ways we think are subject to generally accepted metas, and we usually follow these metas without giving them any second thoughts. Now we can't just assume that every meta is wrong, and that there is always something to be gained from going against the grain. As Tim Ferriss so aptly put it, there are some things that are the meta for a good reason. However, we shouldn't assume that absolutely every meta has a good reason behind it either. Sometimes, the meta can be improved. A lot of you might have heard the story about Dick Fosbury, the high jumper whose unconventional flopping legs and long legs are the reason why he is so successful. He was a great guy, but he was also a great guy who was also a great guy who was very good at playing games. He was a great guy who was good at playing games, and he was also a great guy who was good at playing games, and he was also a great guy who was good at playing games. That's why he was always the best guy to play games. Fosbury's unconventional flopping jump at first won him only ridicule from his peers, and then eventually won him the 1968 Olympic gold medal. Now the Fosbury flop is the new meta for high jump, and it will be until somebody else reinvents it again. Having the courage, presence of mind, and intuition to see where you are imposing arbitrary rules about the way that something needs to be done is an important aspect of wu-wei. Another assumption that we often make that makes tasks harder than they need to be is that we have to have the whole process figured out from the beginning. This is almost always just plain unrealistic. Since we are trying to do something that is usually manifestly impossible, that is see the future, the task seems way harder than it actually is. At the beginning of every difficult and complex task, there is a simple first step. If we can condition ourselves to just take the first simple step without hesitancy, and without overthinking, we will find that our ability to tackle great tasks is greatly increased. Using an example from my own life, I've been wanting to upload the episodes for this download, and I've been trying to get a lot of people to listen to them. I've been trying to get a lot of people to listen to my podcast, and I've been trying to get a lot of people to listen to my podcast, so that people who want to listen to it while they're driving or doing other things can do so. However, it seemed so overwhelming to me to do this because I don't have the slightest idea how podcasts work. So I left this project undone for months. However, the other day I thought to myself, why don't I just take the first step and see where that leads? So I did. I went onto YouTube and looked up how to start a podcast. Long story short, it turns out that it was actually way easier than I thought. I was able to start a podcast on my own, and I was able to get a lot of people to listen to it. At the end of the day, after about an hour and a half of work, I had my first podcast episode uploaded on Spotify. You can go listen to it and follow it if you want. It's just called Dao De Jing Explained, and it's spelled with a T, not with a D. Or you can also look up Song Joy. To be honest, I was shocked at how easy it actually was. I did hesitate to tell you guys this story because now you guys will be able to hold me accountable for uploading the rest of them. Because now I'm confronted with the task of having to do this 63 more times and with getting them onto other platforms. So I'm going to do this 63 more times and counting, and with getting them onto other platforms, such as Apple Podcasts. Which of course means I just need to take the first step again and see where it leads. Long story short, this tip doesn't solve all of your problems, but it certainly can help. And please do be patient with me about the podcast thing. I know I'm sitting here talking about how to make great tasks seem easier, and I am employing these things in my own life, but as I'm sure you'll discover for yourself, these tips don't make the tasks go away. At the end of the day, I still get really easily overwhelmed by things like uploading podcasts and working with insurance and getting car repairs done and things like that. It's a little vulnerable for me to say this because I really want to project an image of a person who's got their life all together, since trying to figure out life is kind of the point of this channel. But I guess I just want you guys to know that I struggle with this stuff as much as anyone else. And a lot of this channel is just me sharing things that I'm finding that are currently helping me, and that I'm trying to work on, rather than me relating this wisdom that I've learned over the course of a lifetime that has turned me into some kind of Taoist master. I hope you've all realized that I'm not some kind of Taoist master. I'm not a Taoist master. I'm not a Taoist master. I'm not a Taoist master. I'm not a Taoist master. I'm not a Taoist master. I hope you've all realized that I'm not some kind of Taoist master. I have so many problems and issues that I'm working on, and although I do believe that I can change, I also know that it's going to take time. And I guess I've just decided that I have things to say, and I'm going to say them, and I can't wait until I'm perfect to do that, or it will never get done. Peace is easily maintained. Trouble is easily overcome before it starts. The brittle is easily shattered. The small is easily scattered. Deal with it before it happens. Set things in order before there is confusion. A tree as great as a man's embrace springs up from a small shoot. A terrace nine stories high begins with a pile of earth. A journey of a thousand miles starts under one's feet. He who acts defeats his own purpose. He who grasps loses. The sage does not act, and so is not defeated. He does not act, and so is not defeated. He does not act, and so is not defeated. He does not grasp, and therefore does not lose. People usually fail when they are on the verge of success. So give as much care to the end as to the beginning. Then there will be no failure. Therefore the sage seeks freedom from desire. He does not collect precious things. He learns not to hold onto ideas. He brings men back to what they have lost. He helps the ten thousand things find their own nature, but refrains from action. All the most complex things in life come from simple beginnings. Great trees begin as tiny seeds. Great journeys begin with one step. Human beings start as a single cell. Complex problems also usually come from simple beginnings. Huge arguments often begin as disagreements over trivialities. Big health problems often start as minor issues. Problems are much harder to get a handle on once they have had time to grow and mature. Often, it makes things much easier to just deal with them when they are small. As we go on in the chapter, we talk about seeing our tasks through. Often when we're close to finishing a task, we try desperately to finish it up so that we can move on to other things. In contrast to this, Laozi recommends a steady, even pace, with great care taken every step of the way. The ancient masters who understood the way of the Tao did not educate people, but made them forget. Smart people are difficult to guide because they think they are too clever. To use cleverness to rule a country is to lead the country to ruin. To avoid cleverness in ruling a country is to lead the country to prosperity. Knowing the two alternatives is a pattern. Remaining aware of the pattern is a virtue. This dark and mysterious virtue is profound. It is opposite our natural inclination, but leads to harmony with the heavens. What were Laozi's thoughts about the main North Korean election in martial arts? This chapter seems a little bit odd, especially to those of us who were raised in western culture, on ideas about democracy and the power of individuals in government. Is Laozi indicating that rulers should keep their subjects intentionally ignorant so that they can not interfere in politics? It does kinda seem to read that way. I think it's fair to acknowledge that Laozi probably never had any contact with any sort of democratic system of government before. Really good if we can forget about it. If he had had any kind of exposure to democracy, I think he would have been pretty covered. If we even thought about Sama's evidence, then Laozi's emails would have been completely widowed up. Would his position have been different? Obviously, it's impossible to say. Is it better for a ruler to keep the subjects ignorant? I don't know. I do think it is fair to say, however, that Taoism often teaches us that knowledge is not all it's cracked up to be. Although knowledge does have its benefits, it often leads a person astray. Probably one of the biggest issues with knowledge is that it often leads to pride and self-righteousness. When we think that we know a good deal about things, we often try to play God with them, and this can lead to terrible results. I watched a super interesting video a while back from Veritasium about the man who invented the process of synthesizing ammonia to make nitrogen fertilizers, Fritz Haber. You should go and watch this video if you have some free time, because I think it's really worth taking a look at. Haber was prompted towards this invention by a panic caused by the realization that global population growth was beginning to outstrip global food population. It's probable that this invention prevented any of the world's most advanced food producers from producing food. However, the story isn't all that black and white, because Fritz Haber later brought forth another invention that had a dramatic impact on humanity, chlorine, phosphine, and mustard gas. If you know even a little bit about World War I, you'll know that being exposed to these kinds of gases was one of the most horrific things a soldier could experience. Chlorine gas damages the air tract, causing buildup of fluid in the lungs, and eventually can cause a person to basically drown on dry land. Mustard gas causes severe chemical burns wherever it touches skin or tissue. Both are terrible ways to die. Haber justified the research and use of chemical weapons because he claimed that the quick and decisive victory they would ensure would in the long term save thousands of lives. However, he was wrong. Chemical weapons were used by both sides, and in many cases, they were used to kill people. They did not prove decisive for either. World War I lasted four years, with an estimated total 40 million military and civilian casualties. It is estimated that chemical weapons such as chlorine gas, phosphine gas, and mustard gas were the cause of over 1.3 million casualties, and around 90,000 deaths. Incredibly, these chemical weapons have even been used more recently in Yemen, Iraq, Iran, and Syria, often against civilians. Unfortunately, this is one of those two reasons why the world's most dangerous and most dangerous genies that never really gets back into the bottle. The tragedy doesn't even end there, however, because the Nazis later used a variant of pesticide gas invented by Haber to exterminate millions of Jews during the Holocaust. Fritz Haber was himself a Jew. Now, breaking this all down, I think we need to be careful about making judgments about people who we have never met and who lived under circumstances we never experienced. But I think this sobering story can serve as a pretty stark warning about how knowledge is a bit of a two-edged sword. We shouldn't assume that greater knowledge always leads to greater outcomes. Knowledge is dangerous if it's not paired with intuition and a closeness with Tao. You know how Fritz Haber invented those fertilizers that saved all those people? Well, even this invention isn't without downsides. I personally used to live within miles of a lake where these kinds of fertilizers leaked over time and nearly destroyed an entire ecosystem. Fertilizers may allow vastly increased production of food, but they can also have really terrible impacts on the environment. Is it worth it? I certainly don't think I'm in a place to make a judgment like that. What I'm trying to show here is that these things are often not all that black and white. Now, to bring this all back to the chapter, I guess I really don't have a conclusion to give you guys about it. I think I'd rather have you form your own opinion here. Is it better for a people to be educated or kept in ignorance? Knowledge certainly has a lot of dangers. However, on the other hand, despotic governments are often able to do what they do largely by keeping their subjects. So, what do you think? What do you think? What do you think? Maybe the benefits of knowledge outweigh the cost. What I'm really trying to do here is give you guys some food for thought and to impress upon you that there are costs for ignorance, as well as costs for knowledge. Everything comes at a cost. Maybe there is no right answer. Maybe there is a lesser of two evils. You're going to have to decide that for yourself. At the end of the day, I think the best thing we can do is to stay close to intuition so that we can be guided on how to use and how not to use knowledge in our own personal lives. Rivers and seas are rulers of the streams of hundreds of valleys, because of the power of their low position. If you want to be a ruler of people, you must speak to them like you are their servant. If you want to lead other people, you must put their interests ahead of your own. The people will not feel burdened if a wise person is in a position of power. The people will not feel like they are being manipulated if a wise person is in front as their leader. The whole world will ask for her guidance and will never get tired of her. Because she does not like to compete, no one can compete with the things she accomplishes. We sometimes hear about the concept of servant leadership, the idea that leaders aim to serve those who they preside over. Some have called this idea revolutionary because it turns the classical hierarchies of leadership upside down. However, this idea is not all that revolutionary at all, because Laozi was talking about this idea more than 2000 years ago. This idea may not have originated with Laozi, but it has been passed down all throughout the ages. Jesus said, Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister, and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant. In feudal times, the idea of a king was often conflated with that of a father protector. Under feudalism, the king's purpose was to watch over his people, to watch over his subjects, and to protect them from outside threats. And they, in turn, would offer their labor for the maintenance of the kingdom and would rally to his aid when needed. This was the theory behind the system anyway. Sadly, we know that throughout history, many leaders have failed to fill this role, choosing instead to abuse the power that fortune has laid upon them for their own personal gain. The solution to this problem is not to do away with leaders altogether, and Laozi never proposed this. Instead, he urges all leaders to play the part of the king, the part that is given them with humility and kindness. This is another one of those paradoxes you see in the application of Taoism to life. The more you put others before yourself, the more respect you will garner as a leader, and the more secure your position will be. On the other hand, the more you strive to make your position over others secure, the more people will begin to resent you, and the shakier your hold on that power becomes. A wise ruler makes it his or her business to give the people as much autonomy as possible, therefore the people do not feel micromanaged, and they don't chafe under the heavy hand of an authoritarian system. They become self-reliant, rather than needing to be instructed and provided for at every turn. They feel empowered to provide for themselves. The wise ruler ultimately is secure in their position, and the people feel this. Therefore, there is no need to compete or perform in order to try and win the loyalty of those being ruled. They offer it gladly, because they know that they can trust the ruler to look at the situation and to be able to do what they want. They are willing to take out for their best interests and to respect their rights. The preeminent, they consider it in the most man-given of their diligence to make their tribe proud and president loop, they do not wish their serveylite gets worse with the circumstances that they might be in, and the humans are extremely rude. . . . . . the This chapter stands out to me a lot, largely because of the section where Lao-tzu states that there are three treasures which he holds and keeps. To put this in context, remember, this is Taoism we're talking about here. You know, Taoism, that philosophy that's all about letting go of things. And here we're told that even with that in mind, there are three things that Lao-tzu considers to be so important that they are not subject to this rule of letting things go. What are these things? Mercy, also translated as compassion, Economy, also translated as moderation, and Daring not to be ahead of others, also translated as humility or daring not to take the lead. It seemed to me that these three attributes were so important that they really needed to be addressed individually, and so to accomplish this within the demands of my time, I decided to make this chapter into a three part, one video for each attribute, and each video taking a look at a different translation of the same chapter. So with that, we'll waste no more time and dive into the first attribute, Mercy. So the translation I used for this chapter was the Xiaofu Fang, I hope I'm saying that right, but the Xiaofu Fang and Jane English translation, which I appreciate because of its clarity, conciseness, and tendency to adhere to the overall average of what all the other translations are saying. The way I interpret it, if you take and line up all the different translations of the Tao De Jing on a spectrum, at least the ones that I read because there are literally hundreds of them. But it seems that the Xiaofu Fang usually falls about in the middle. I don't usually see it making any crazy divergences from the other translations, and overall it seems to me to be a pretty good one for getting the general idea of what's being said. So with that, this translation renders the first attribute as Mercy, but other translations that I will use for this chapter call it Compassion. So why does Laozi set so much store by compassion? Well, if you read throughout the Tao De Jing, you will see the idea of compassion and other-centeredness coming out all over the text. We've talked about the idea of primal union, or oneness with all things, being defined as an ability to take all things as part of yourself, by conflating their interests and needs with your own. This is love in the truest sense, to identify others as being a part of yourself and caring for them as much as you would for yourself. But looking again at chapter 67, Laozi says something very interesting. He says, From mercy comes courage. He says, From mercy comes courage. That's what he says. With compassion you will be able to be brave. And still another puts it as, If you're compassionate you can be fearless. But what does this mean? How does compassion lead to bravery? To figure this out, let's consider the idea of courage for a minute, and examine the different motivations for courage. There have been many brave and courageous acts done in the world, but they have been done for many different reasons. I think that when we really examine these reasons though, we can largely divide them into two categories. for the sake of the self and courage for the sake of others. A person may do a brave thing in order to get something they want, courage for the self. They may also be brave for the sake of impressing others, also courage for the self. On the other hand, they may be brave for the sake of helping others to be brave, which I suppose would go under courage for others. Or they may be brave in order that somebody else might gain something or be saved from something, which obviously goes under courage for the sake of others. There may also be times when a brave act serves both the person acting and somebody else, but I don't think this deserves its own category since this instance only borrows from the other two categories rather than bringing something else to the table. So now let's examine these two categories a bit more. Courage for the sake of the self can be motivated by desire, ambition, lust, greed, or selfishness. Bravery on behalf of others is motivated exclusively by true love. You cannot do anything for anyone else for any reason other than love. If you do something for someone else and you are motivated by pride, glory, or a desire to look good, or even a desire to be the kind of person that does things for others, you are not doing things for others at all. You are doing it for yourself. This action may serve someone else, but at the end of the day, it wasn't for them that you did it. In doing the action, you were thinking primarily of the self. Therefore, bravery that truly occurs for others can only be motivated by love. Now, when a person does a brave thing, it does in fact matter where the motivation comes from. If a person is brave in doing something for others, they are motivated by their own desire. If they do something on behalf of the self, their bravery will only last until the desire they are being brave for is overcome by a stronger selfish desire. Let's say hypothetically that you want to attack another person to take their money. It does take a certain amount of courage to attack another person head on. You are willing to muster this courage in order to gratify your desire for this person's money. However, let's say that you run over to attack them and realize that they are holding a weapon and you have none. Will you proceed to show bravery in the face of danger to gratify your desire for their money? You probably won't. You will only be able to do so if you are brave enough to do so. If you are brave enough to do so, you will probably get out of there as quick as you can. Why? Because your self-serving desire to avoid injury or death is greater than your self-serving desire to have their money. Bravery that is motivated by a selfish desire always runs the risk of being overcome by another selfish desire. Bravery that is motivated by love, however, seems to have the power to overcome even the greatest self-serving desires. Perfect love has the ability to overcome fear. History is full of people, known and unknown, who are able to show spectacular bravery in the face of danger. Bravery that is motivated by a selfish desire is more likely to be overcome by a selfish desire. When you choose to put someone else's needs above your own, and you go to great and courageous lengths in order to meet them, you have access to a greater courage and power than can be harnessed by a person acting under selfish desires alone. This is the power of Tao. Love, compassion, oneness with all things, this is the nature of the Tao's influence on the world. The end of the chapter tells us, Mercy brings victory in battle and strength in defense. It is the means by which heaven saves and guards. All that the Tao does is done by love. It cares for everyone and everything, and it does so without any desire to be recognized or compensated. In short, the Tao takes care of all things by compassion, mercy, and love. The closer we get to Tao, the more we likewise come to embody this same kind of selfless love for all things. I don't know if the order is significant when Lao Tzu names his most prized treasures, but I do find it interesting that he makes mention of this one first. May we all come closer to Tao, so that we can likewise possess this same love. The world talks about honoring the Tao, but you can't tell it from their actions. Because it is thought of as great, the world makes light of it. It seems too easy for anyone to use. There are three jewels that I cherish. Compassion, moderation, and humility. With compassion, you will be able to be brave. With moderation, you will be able to be brave. With compassion, you will be able to be brave. With moderation, you will be able to be brave. With moderation, you will be able to be brave. With moderation, you will be able to give to others. With humility, you will be able to become a great leader. To abandon compassion while seeking to be brave, or abandoning moderation while being benevolent, or abandoning humility while seeking to lead, will only lead to greater trouble. The compassionate warrior will be the winner, and if compassion is your defense, you will be secure. Compassion is the protector of heaven's salvation. Compassion is the protector of heaven's salvation. Today we're going to be talking about the second of the three jewels that Lao Tzu claims to cherish. This video is part two of a three-part mini-series, so if you haven't watched yesterday's video yet, I would recommend pausing this video and going to watch that video first. Yesterday we talked all about compassion, its benefits, and how it leads to bravery. Today we will be talking about moderation. So in the translation we're using today, the J.H. Macdonald translation, this attribute, is referred to as moderation, but in other translations it is sometimes called economy, frugality, or simplicity. It looks like overall we are dealing with the concept of not taking more than we need, being content with the things that we have, and simplifying our lives. This obviously runs very contrary to the cultures of many modern societies. However, for much, if not the majority of human history, frugality has not just been a nice quality to improve your life, but an absolute necessity for preserving your life. For much of the human existence, and for many humans even today, food and resources are scarce, and frugality is a survival skill. I remember hearing stories about my great-grandparents who lived through the depression, stories about how they would do weird things like wash plastic forks and reuse paper plates. I've at times been annoyed by older people who have seemingly tried to guilt trip me into eating every single morsel on my plate, no matter how questionable it looked. These habits look strange and even obnoxious to us now, but back then they helped our great-grandparents survive. Part of me wonders if there ever were to be a similar depression, how my generation would fare. Would we be able to adapt to the new scarcity, or would a lifetime of being used to having more than enough of everything come around to bite us? Who knows? Frugality isn't just a survival skill, though. For those of us who currently live under circumstances where we are not constantly faced with starvation or poverty, simple living still makes a big difference. I know there are a lot of people watching these videos who are from large cities, and maybe many of you have never had the chance to go camp out in the desert, or go to the desert to get some fresh air, or go to the desert to go out in nature by yourself. This makes me kind of sad, because I was really lucky to be born in a place where nature was really close, and where regular or at least semi-regular camping was more or less the norm. This was probably partly because I'm from a small town where there wasn't much else to do other than camp. For those of you who haven't been camping, I encourage you to give it a try sometime if you can. It's really great. And you know what makes it great? Well, being out in nature is always good, and it's fun to do the things that come along with camping, like hiking, biking, and fishing. But you know the best part about camping? It's just that you can't get enough of it. You don't have to worry about anything else, and you don't have to worry about anything else. But you know the best part about camping? It's the fact that you are out away from the rest of your life. Big public campgrounds don't accomplish this quite as well as just going to the mountains or something like that. If you're able to get out far enough away from people, it's like the whole modern world just gets put on pause for a few days, and you don't have to think about it at all. Your school or job is miles away, you don't have to talk to anyone, and if you're really lucky, your phone doesn't even have service. Or I guess you could just turn it off. You know, that works too. Camping is great because it's a kind of forced simplicity. It makes you cut out the distractions in your life. You don't get to choose from 30 different outfits. All you've got is what you've packed. You aren't thinking about the different errands you need to run. They're miles away. No texts, emails, social media, or anything like that to break the solace. It's just you, whoever you went with, and nature. Camping's great, but the thing about it is that it only lasts for a certain amount of time. If you want that kind of simplicity in your life, you're going to have to fight for it a little more, or at least make a couple conscious decisions. While there is no one-size-fits-all plan for creating simplicity in your life, I'll go ahead and share some things that have helped me, and maybe a couple of them will work for you. My first suggestion is to start with your physical space. If you're surrounded by clutter, your life is going to feel cluttered. I recommend starting with a space that's important to you, and that doesn't seem too overwhelming to clear up. Do the space that seems easiest, and that would mean a lot to you to have clean. For me personally, I started with my computer desk, because it was important to me, and it didn't need that much work to get it clear though. Try and keep that space completely clear as long as you can. Once clutter inevitably finds its way into your space, no big deal. Just clear it off again and keep going. Once you feel ready, you can move on to other spaces. My second suggestion is to get rid of stuff. This is probably one of my favorite steps. It's a lot easier to keep spaces free of stuff, when there just is less stuff to take up space. Again, I would start off with whatever seems easiest so you can build up some momentum. I think I started off with my clothes when I did this. This will be easier for some people than for others. If you want, just start with what you know you're okay getting rid of. Keep the things that are really important to you, and don't feel bad about it. For the hard stuff that falls somewhere in between, you can try putting it on probation. Put it in a box, and go put that box away where you're not going to look at it. After a few weeks, come back to the box and see if you're ready to let go of any of the stuff in it. If you are, do it. If you're not, then don't. Often after doing this, you realize that you really didn't need whatever it was in the box all this time, and chances you probably won't need it again in the future. But if you still want it, keep it, no worries. One of the cool things about minimalizing your possessions is that you really start to learn who you are and what's important to you. One of the coolest things I've ever done as far as self-discovery was to minimalize my music. I used to be a music production guy, and I loved finding new music to listen to. But I realized about a year ago that all this music was just sitting in my Apple Music Library, not being listened to. And when I put my tunes on shuffle, I was skipping more than half of my music. I was just sitting there, listening to music, and I was just sitting there, listening to music. I was just sitting there, listening to music. And when I put my tunes on shuffle, I was skipping more than half of my music. I was just sitting there, listening to music. And when I put my tunes on shuffle, I was skipping more than half of my music. I was just sitting there, listening to music. So I decided to pare it down. And let me tell you, I was pretty brutal. I started this project last year in July or August with over 3000 songs. I decided that I was going to go through my entire library starting at A, and if I wanted to keep a song, I had to listen to it all the way through. If I couldn't do that, I had to get rid of it. This project has taken me almost a year. I'm nearly through it now, and my library of over 3000 songs is currently sitting at about 800. But you know what's cool? These 800 songs are all songs that I actually like, like every single one of them. I learned so much about myself through this process. I realized how much my choice of music, as well as my life in general, has been dictated by what I thought all the cool people were doing. I realized there was a lot of quote unquote cool music out there that I honestly just didn't like. Now that I'm almost done with this, I know what I like, and I'm okay with it. I don't need to curate my music library to impress anybody else. It's my library. I don't need to curate my music library to impress anybody else. It's my library. I had a similar experience with clothes. I used to buy lots of different kinds of clothes to try and look stylish. Now I own two pair of pants, one of which I need to throw away honestly, and about five of the exact same plain white t-shirt. It's hot where I live, so I also have two pairs of shorts, and again, I think I'm about ready to say goodbye to one of them. My wife has a similar system. We call it our uniform system, where we wear the exact same uniform every day. I like my black pants, or shorts, and my white t-shirt. I don't need to wear anything else. I don't need to wear anything else. I don't need to wear anything else. I don't need to wear anything else. I don't need to wear anything else. I don't need to wear anything else. I don't need to wear anything else. I don't need to wear anything else. I don't need to wear anything else. I'm not saying you have to do exactly what I did. This just works for me, and I like it. You do what works for you, but make sure that you're moving in the direction of simplicity. My third recommendation is to try and target places where things pile up, including digital spaces. Go through your storage shed. How much stuff can you get rid of? It honestly gets to become a bit of a dopamine trip once you get into it. I don't know what it is exactly, but you feel somehow lighter after minimalizing your things. It's very freeing. I also feel like going through your possessions, from different parts of your life, is kind of sacred in a way, because it helps you process the feelings you were feeling at that time. It's really cathartic. For me, letting go of the stuff helps me to let go of the experience. A lot of times when I get rid of something that I used to love but don't need anymore, it's like I'm telling it, thank you, you were really important to me, and I'm very grateful for that, and now I'm ready to move on. Or sometimes I come across something that brings up bad memories, and I'm able to just go ahead and process those bad feelings that come up. When we hold onto our stuff, I wonder if sometimes it's symbolic of holding onto past parts of our lives that this stuff represents. But the truth is that those parts of our lives, just like the stuff that reminds us of them, are from a different time that we no longer live in. It's OK to let it go. Some of the items you may want to keep, and that's totally fine, but I've found a lot of satisfaction over the years by letting go of a lot of this stuff. And can I just give you my opinion? I really really really really would recommend not selling this stuff. selling the stuff you get rid of. Just give it away to someone who can make use of it. If you can think of someone in your life who would really like the thing you're getting rid of, send them a text and offer it to them. Don't take any money for it. If you can't think of anyone, or if nobody seems to want it, don't keep badgering people about it. Just put it up for free on Facebook Marketplace, or give it to a thrift store. If it's something that really can't be thrifted, or if nobody on the internet seems to want it, just throw it away. It's as easy as that. Don't be that person who has to try and get money out of everything you do. If you're in serious need of the money, that may be a different matter, but if you're not in dire straits, just give it away. Some of the coolest experiences I've had with people over the last few years have been from giving away my old stuff, some of it to people I knew, and some of it to complete strangers. People are often really grateful when you give them things that are actually worth something to them. It's super fun. Give it a try. When you're tackling your digital spaces, obviously this is a little bit different. I mean, you're not going to go thrift the old pictures on your phone. Some of these more digital spaces are more fun to do, and some of these more can be really intimidating to tackle because of how easy it is to fill them. Just start right away on one of them, and keep coming back to it. I shared my example with my music already. That's taken me a year. I did it by finding a system that worked for me. What worked for me was to listen to it while driving, and then delete all the stuff I skipped when I got to my destination. Other digital spaces I've begun to tackle are my audiobooks, podcasts, and even my video games. I've limited myself to listening to three audiobooks at a time. I can only start a book when I find it. I can only start a new book when I find it. I can only start a new book when I finish an old one. I'm drawing these three mostly from the huge reservoir of books that I've started but haven't finished. As far as podcasts, I'm listening to only one right now, and I'm not going to try and start another one until I get through this one. I understand that a lot of podcasts are not necessarily designed to be listened to all the way through. The one that I'm listening to is, so I'm going to. Again, do what works for you. Finally, for you Steam game collectors out there, you might find it rewarding to go through and see what video games you want to get rid of, or at least uninstall. I'm on a game that I've been playing for a long time, and I've goal right now that's similar to my audiobook goal. I'm only playing three single player video games at a time, and I only get to start a new game when I finish one of the three. Everything else I've uninstalled except for the games that I play with friends and family. Outside of single player games, I also enjoy multiplayer games that require long-term skill acquisition, like Valorant or Apex Legends or League. For these games, I'm choosing to only play one of them until I reach a certain rank goal, at which point I will evaluate if I want to go farther in that game or switch it out for another. I know this is a lot of work, but I'm going to do my best to get through it. This is all pretty heavy-handed. This is just what I'm doing right now, and so far, I like it. You decide what you want your simplified life to look like, and start today with something that feels easy. Don't start a million projects all at once. Do something easy now, and you'll pick up momentum as you go. Simplicity and frugality are not just physical survival skills. They are emotional survival skills. When you choose to be conscious about how you fill your time, space, and schedule, you'll have more space left over for the things that really matter, and the people that really matter. Like I said, just start today with something that's easy to do. Clear off a space, cancel an activity, go through a pile of clothes. Use your quest for simplicity as a means of self-discovery, and let others benefit from the things you get rid of. Simplifying your life seems really hard before you start it, but it does get easier, and it gets more fun too. The whole world says, what you teach is great, yet unlike anything else. It is its greatness that makes it unlike anything else. Were it like everything else, it would have become trivial a long time ago. I have three treasures which I hold and keep safe. The first is compassion. The second, economy. The third, not daring to take the lead. If you're compassionate, you can be fearless. If you're not wasteful, you can be giving. If you're afraid to lead, you can attain the highest honors. Today, people renounce compassion and try to be brave. They are wasteful and extreme, and try to be brave. They are not afraid to lead. They are not afraid to be brave. They are not giving. They refuse to follow, and they try to take the lead. They are certainly doomed. Compassion gives you victory in battle, and strength in defense. When heaven comes to your rescue, with its compassion, it keeps you safe. This will be the third and final video I'm going to make about chapter 67. We've used this little three-part miniseries to talk about the three treasures that Lao Tzu claimed to prize above all others. We've already talked about compassion, in part one, and economy in part two. So if you haven't seen those videos, go ahead and go watch them. Today, we're going to be talking about what this translation refers to as not daring to take the lead. Basically, we're dealing with humility and restraint with regards to leadership. Lao Tzu tells us that if we can exercise our self-control and not strive for positions of power, we can, quote, attain the highest honors. In other words, only through not striving to put ourselves into leadership positions can we ultimately become qualified. When Lao Tzu speaks about this, they aren't just empty words. Any person that could have written the Dao De Jing probably was very capable of leading people, and likely would have done a great job. For such a person, the temptation to seek leadership would likely have been great. I mean, think about it. Lao Tzu, whoever he was, very likely looked at all the leaders around him and saw their deficiencies. Wise as he was, he must have seen flaws in their leadership, and he was probably very conscious. The fact that he could have done a much better job, and to be honest, he probably could have. It seems to me that the temptation to put oneself on a pedestal must be so much greater when one is actually qualified to stand on one. We can say that we avoid leadership positions and embrace humility, but a lot of times, for us, this is all just talk. It's easy to avoid leadership positions that we don't even qualify for. But for someone like Lao Tzu, this might have been extremely difficult. I don't know if this is a temptation, for you guys, but have you ever been listening to someone talk about something you happen to be pretty well informed about, and they get all their facts wrong? Maybe this is just me, but that kind of thing drives me crazy. I have a really hard time not correcting people in these kinds of situations, especially if it's a person I feel comfortable correcting. Oftentimes, I do it automatically, even without thinking about it. But as Lao Tzu was well aware, correcting people all the time is not a sign of intelligence. If you ever hang around people who really know things, you're probably going to be able to do it. But if you're not, you're going to be troubled next. I've watched reality, the fact that everything is so stupid in human history. You know, lamenting a doom for a measure of everything is the thing that can change your world when you wake up, and reasonable things happen all the time. Being made a fool of is02 senor. Sometimes you can hear yourself, overcome a reality that's not the answer you desire to vocalize,與, which means, you haven't? I remember being a student in three calling Luke King. He was the leader of a student who was large. Once it became known that our physics were able to Seal, he jumped off an escalator and pushed me off Stonehenge. Not my student skills due to the AI system changed from the tadpoles to something more pillsome. His abilities were surely able to challenge the needs of race, sometimes even the forgetfulness of岂 I watched other content from this individual regularly. I researched what was wrong within this They're a truly amazing creator and I have a high amount of respect for them, and so I don't think that this is how this person comes off normally. But for whatever reason, it seemed like in this particular interview, the time was taken up almost as much by them asking their wordy questions as it was by Rick's actual answers. I started to get annoyed with this after a while, because I really just wanted to hear what Rick had to say. I mean, that was supposed to be the whole point of the interview. But Rick was just so calm throughout this. He almost never interrupted. He didn't try to take control of the conversation. He didn't get frustrated at all. At least not that I could see. He really didn't seem to have his own agenda or plans for what he wanted to cover. He just calmly and concisely answered the interviewer's questions and allowed the conversation to go in whatever direction the other person steered it. You see this a lot with true masters. They don't try to push their skills or their mastery or their knowledge on others. Their wisdom speaks for itself. Some see it and some don't, but they don't really seem to be bothered either way. It is one of those great ironies of life that those who know the most are the least inclined to push it on others, unless they ask for it. The true master doesn't often correct. It's the novice who is the most pedantic. The person who says the most is often the person with the least value to add. The same principle of restraint applies to leadership as well. The best way to become a leader is to let it happen naturally, if it happens at all. Those who seek positions of power walk on a slippery slope. Leadership is one of those things that you can't do without. It's not just about being a leader. It's about being a leader. It's about being a leader. It's about being a leader. It's about being a leader. It's about being a leader. It's about being a leader. It's about being a leader. If you seek it, then you'll find it doesn't work out quite the same way when you actually seek it. This road often leads to hubris and disaster. I think Dumbledore really does say it best when he tells Harry Potter. It is a curious thing, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it, those who have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must and find to their own surprise that they wore it well. This attribute of restraint and humility was so important Laotze that he would rather watch other rulers make mistakes than violate this modality. this most prized possession by stepping up to correct them. Perhaps mistakes were made that could have been prevented. Perhaps harms were done that needn't have been. However, the master understands that the point of life is not to stop every bad thing from happening, nor is this even possible. The master realizes that fate is a tricky business, and we put ourselves and others in jeopardy when we try and play God. There are times to interfere and act, but we must know when these are by using our restraint and our intuition. The Tao, our ultimate example, allows quote-unquote bad things to happen all the time. But the Tao possesses ultimate perspective, and the understanding that just because we think a bad thing is bad does not mean it is necessarily so. In nature, herds of deer will die out without predators to keep their populations in check. Some trees literally cannot reproduce unless there's a forest fire. Some ultimate goods can only be brought about by temporary bads. This is not a problem, but it is a problem. This is a process that can be controlled, simulated, or positively affected by the efforts of people. This is a reality that has been at play eons before humans existed, and will continue to exist forever after humans leave the picture. To think that we can improve such a cosmic interplay is the height of foolishness, and it is all too characteristic of the narcissistic short-sightedness that plagues our species. If we can have the patience and the wisdom to let events take their course, not striving to lead or to be in charge of others, we will find that our closeness with Tao puts us in a position to act, often by leading others, without our even asking for it. The best warriors do not use violence. The best generals do not destroy indiscriminately. The best tacticians try to avoid confrontation. The best leaders become servants of their people. This is called the virtue of non-competition. This is called the power to manage others. This is called attaining harmony with the heavens. In this chapter, Lao Tzu lays out various occupations, and describes what constitutes excellence for each of them. All of these examples he makes mention of reinforce the common theme of moderation, self-control, and lack of ego. Basically, to me, the idea at play here is that we should cultivate ourselves not to rely on the affirmation that comes from beating others at what we do. Soldiers, generals, tacticians, these are all occupations that are competitive by nature. A soldier cannot be a soldier if there is never anybody to fight. Lao Tzu recognizes that some battles are inevitable. There are times when competition becomes necessary. What he seems to be concerned with here is how we conduct ourselves when these competitions take place. How do we respond when we win? How do we respond when we lose? Are we pompous, arrogant, or vainglorious? Do we demonize or ridicule the people we compete against? Or do we recognize and respect their humanity, and respect their values? This is a very important question. We must be very self-confident even as we compete against them. Do we seek out engagements to gratify our egos? Or do we try to accomplish what needs to be done without causing harm to others whenever possible? So many of these principles operate on seeming paradoxes. A good tactician can plan a victorious battle, but a great one can sometimes win while avoiding a battle altogether. A good leader can successfully lead the people, but a great leader sees him or herself as their servant. For those of us who aren't soldiers or tacticians, these philosophies still apply to us. We should monitor ourselves carefully, taking care lest we do the things we do to satisfy some ulterior motive for self-gratification. There is an old saying, it is better to become the passive in order to see what will happen. It is better to retreat a foot than to advance only an inch. This is called being flexible while advancing, pushing back without using force, and destroying the enemy without engaging him. There is no greater disaster than underestimating your enemy. Underestimating your enemy means losing your greatest asset. When equal forces meet in battle, victory will go to the one that enters with the greatest sorrow. The paragraph that really stood out to me in this chapter was the first one that talks about how it is better to retreat a foot than to advance only an inch. This is one of the main underlying ideas behind Wu Wei, the idea that going forward isn't always the most effective. The idea that going forward isn't always the most effective. The idea that going forward is the most optimal option. Sometimes it's better to move slowly until the right moment. If faced with the decision between going forward an inch or going back a foot, our first inclination is usually to go forward every time. However, what we don't take into account is that the paths to the things we want are often not straight lines. They curve, they bend, and sometimes they seem to go backward. Going forward an inch may seem more productive, but the Taoist knows that stepping backward a bit often allows us to see the path ahead more clearly. Then, instead of desperately clinging to every inch of progress, we might see a path off to the side that lets us go forward a mile. There's a super cool TED talk out there by David Epstein. You can find it on YouTube. It's called How Falling Behind Can Get You Ahead. Honestly, you should probably just go watch that video because he puts it so much better than I ever could. Basically, the video is about how the rush to specialize in our careers often leads to problems down the road, and how those who take a little more time in the beginning to experience different things, without necessarily moving ahead in any of them, often end up outstripping their peers later down the road. We seek to specialize early in our careers because we see it as the quickest path to success, but this isn't always the case. In the talk, Epstein shares an example of a study on comic book creators, where researchers tried to determine what factors make a creator more likely to create a blockbuster comic. The interesting result of the study is that, in the book, the topic of the book is more than just a comic book, but the topic of the An interesting result of the study was that they discovered that the most influential variable was how many genres the creator had worked across. Even more interesting, they found that this factor was more important than other seemingly essential factors, such as amount of experience making comics, or resources available to them from the publisher. We tend to look at those who dabble in multiple areas as unmotivated, uncommitted, and unsuccessful. We often dismiss them with terms like, Jack of all trades, master of none. But there is research that indicates that these more slow moving, well rounded individuals have advantages that early specializers just don't have. You'll have to go watch the TED talk for more on this, and I really recommend you do because it's very good. It gives a lot of great examples of this concept of taking a step backward to later take steps forward. The most important thing in my opinion is to listen to your intuition. Don't do something just because everybody else is doing it, or because it seems like the normal thing. Take the time to engage with your intuition and feel what the right stuff is. If you take the time to do this, you will know. There's a saying that you hear a lot in athletics, slow is smooth, smooth is fast. I believe this saying comes from the Navy Seals. The meaning behind this is that if you're willing to take things a bit slower, it pays off in the long run by allowing you to do things more smoothly, which helps prevent you from making as many mistakes. I definitely understand what it feels like to feel like you're getting behind, and it's not fun, but if you can have the courage and the trust to follow your intuition even at the cost of looking dumb, you'll be glad you did. My words are easy to understand, and it is easy to follow them. Yet they can be grasped by no one in the world, and there is no one who can follow them. My words are of an ancient origin. My actions are guided by reason. Yet this remains unknown, so I remain unknown too. Those who know me are few. This is what honors me. I am the one who knows. The sage wears plain clothing. His true wealth is concealed in his heart. This chapter kind of feels to me like Lao Tzu's Haters Gonna Hate chapter. For us, when we talk about people who don't understand us, it's usually with kind of a bitter taste in our mouths. However, I don't get that so much from Lao Tzu. Lao Tzu is well aware of the fact that few people will understand him and the way he chooses to live, but he doesn't see this necessarily as a bad thing. He says, Those who know me are few. This is what honors me. He says, Those who know me are few. This is what honors me. Part of becoming a person of enlightenment is learning to value what others cast aside and to cast aside what others value. This doesn't mean that we reject popular things and ideas outright simply because they are popular, but it does mean that we are wary of them. People often like the idea of an actualized life, but very few are willing to do what it takes to realize it. Although following the Tao is not complicated, most people are willing to follow it. But the Tao is not complicated. The Tao is not complicated. Most people aren't willing to do it. Therefore, a lot of people never experience a lot of the joy that is available in life. We don't judge them or look down on them for this, but we do want to be aware of whose opinions we allow to hold sway in our own lives. The fact that Lao Tzu's actions are understood by so few does not in and of itself mean that they are right, but it can serve as one metric. Ernest Hemingway, with his characteristically snarky wit, once said in a lecture to art students, Ernest Hemingway, with his characteristically snarky wit, once said in a lecture to art students, Ernest Hemingway, with his characteristically snarky wit, once said in a lecture to art students, Ernest Hemingway, with his characteristically snarky wit, once said in a lecture to art students, Ernest Hemingway, with his characteristically snarky wit, once said in a lecture to art students, Ernest Hemingway, with his characteristically snarky wit, once said in a lecture to art students, Ernest Hemingway, with his characteristically snarky wit, once said in a lecture to art students, Ernest Hemingway, with his characteristically snarky wit, once said in a lecture to art students, Ernest Hemingway, with his characteristically snarky wit, once said in a lecture to art students, Ernest Hemingway, with his characteristically snarky wit, always said in a lecture to art are the kind that are concealed in the heart, rather than being of a tangible and physical kind. The sage doesn't have a need to look impressive to anyone else, because he knows the real things of value are the ones that nobody else sees. Knowing you don't know is wholeness. Thinking you know is a disease. Only by recognizing you have an illness can you move to seek a cure. The master is whole because she sees her illnesses and treats them, and thus is able to remain whole. We live in a world where knowledge is power, or at least it's supposed to be. But there is one kind of knowledge that is so important that without it, our other knowledge becomes a detriment more than an asset. This knowledge is called self-awareness. You see, it's not important just to know what we know, but to know what we don't know. Now, if you don't mind me diverging a bit, there's an analogy from trading that, helps explain why this is the case. There's this pervasive myth that goes around that traders can make money because they are somehow able to know what the stock or commodities markets are going to do. This is false. No trader ever knows what the market is going to do. In fact, many of the worst things that can happen to traders happen as a result of the trader thinking they know what will happen. When a trader thinks they know what is going to happen at any particular moment in the market, they make bets they otherwise wouldn't. They fail to protect themselves from excess losses. And in general, just neglect to give the uncertainty of the market the respect it deserves. A good trader knows very well that he or she does not know what is going to happen in the market. Because they recognize that anything can happen, they treat the market like what it is. An environment of probabilistic, but uncertain outcomes. Traders can make money in the markets because they are aware of certain patterns that occur in the fluctuation of the prices of stocks or commodities. These patterns are sometimes called edges. Good traders are good traders, not because their edges can predict the market with impunity, but because the traders are able to put on disciplined trades based on their edges, which gives them a slightly higher chance of success. Casinos make money in a similar way. In any game of blackjack, for example, the outcome of the specific game is uncertain. A casino does not know whether it will win or lose any single game of blackjack. However, they do know that because of how the game works, they have a slightly higher chance of winning. In blackjack, the player has about a 42% chance of winning. While the casino has about a 49% chance of winning. The odds of a tie happening make up the last 8 or 9%. Therefore, it would be silly of a casino to claim that they knew the outcomes of any one game of blackjack. However, they do know that they can count on winning about 7% more of the games than they lose, and that over the course of many games, this 7% can produce a reliable profit. This is also the game that traders play. A good trader never assumes that they can predict the outcome of any single event with certainty. Attempting to do so leads to recklessness and ruin. Instead, they opt to play the long game, knowing that while they can't predict the outcome of any single trade, their edge gives them a slight probabilistic advantage that plays out over the course of many trades, and which over time can produce a profit. The irony of the thing is that by embracing the uncertainty of the market, they are able to have a degree of certainty in their long-term outcomes. Knowing what they don't know is one of the main skills that allows them to make money. Learning to think in probability is a key skill that allows them to make money. Knowing what they don't know, instead of uncertainties, is an essential skill for a trader, and frankly, in my opinion, is one of the most underrated skills in life. Knowing what you don't know is not just a skill for traders. Knowing what you don't know helps us to steer clear of classic and catastrophic human pitfalls, such as hubris and arrogance. It also allows us to be aware of problems in our lives that need our attention. Often, we don't like to be aware of our shortcomings, because being aware of our weakness is uncomfortable, even emotionally painful. We avoid it for the same reason we avoid physical pain. But think about what the point of pain is in the first place. Physical pain acts as a signal that something in our body is out of order or has been harmed in some way, and may require our attention so that our bodies can continue to function properly. It's like an indicator on the dashboard of your car telling you that something needs checking. Emotional pain has much the same purpose. When we feel the emotional pain that comes from being aware of a weakness, we shouldn't run away from it or deny that it exists. Can you imagine what would happen if your body was telling you that your appendix was rupturing and you just tried to act like nothing was wrong? This would obviously be really bad. But the effects of ignoring or running away from emotional pain are just as detrimental to our emotional and spiritual health as ignoring physical pain is to our physical health. The Master does not do this. He or she realizes that being aware of his or her deficiencies is an advantage. Chapter 33 of the Tao Te Ching tells us, Those who know others are intelligent. Those who know themselves are truly wise. Those who master others are strong. Those who master themselves have true power. Just like the trader is profitable by knowing what he or she doesn't know, the sage is whole by knowing where he or she is weak. When men lack a sense of awe, there will be disaster. Do not intrude into their homes. Do not harass them at work. If you do not interfere, they will not be able to see you. Do not interfere. Do not harass them at work. Do not interfere. Do not interfere. Do not interfere. Do not interfere. Do not interfere. Do not interfere. Do not interfere. Do not interfere. Do not interfere. Do not interfere. Do not interfere. Do not interfere. Therefore, the sage knows himself but makes no show. He has self-respect but is not arrogant. He lets go of that and chooses this. This chapter seems to be a bit of a grab bag of three different themes. The value of having a sense of awe, the value of governing with a light hand, and the balance of self-respect and others-mindedness. I think one of the great tragedies of our time is how much our sense of wonder and awe has declined as a human race. All throughout the history of mankind, humanity has always had a respect for something higher than the self. Whether it was a god or gods or nature spirits or anything really, I just think it's really important for people to have something to look at that's higher than the self, and hold some kind of respect and reverence for something bigger than them. It's one of the few natural checks on human narcissism, and I think that we're starting to feel the effects of its absence today. Many people go throughout life with no purpose other than to be born, make money, and then die. This is such a depressing outlook on life. From talking to people, it seems like most people do believe in something, whatever they choose to call it or choose not to call it. What I think might actually be declining is the tendency of people to allow these beliefs to influence their actions in some kind of tangible way. If we really do believe in something, such as the Tao, this belief should affect the way we live our lives. Whether this is in decline or not, a sense of awe and respect for powers greater than our own is an important aspect of humanity. And Lao-tzu agreed. One of the reasons for this is that it can help to nourish humility. Now I know that sometimes humility gets a bad rap in pop culture. I guess this is only natural in a culture that is so concerned with asserting your own individuality. Our culture tends to scream a lot of me, me, me, but I don't think Lao-tzu would have been very impressed by this. Also notice though that Lao-tzu doesn't advise us to get down on ourselves, or to try to think of ourselves as worse than we are. This is not humility. Humility is not good-looking people trying to think they're ugly or smart people trying to think that they're stupid. Humility has more to do with just spending overall less time thinking about ourselves in general and spending more time and energy taking care for others. Humility means that you see yourself as objectively as possible and that you don't waste energy either aggrandizing or deprecating yourself. It's less about how you evaluate yourself and more about taking the focus off of yourself altogether. Did you do a really good job on that project? Yeah, you really did and you should feel joy about that in the same way that you would feel joy from seeing a sunset or hearing a piece of music you like. The joy isn't in the fact that you are the one that did it but in the fact that it exists. You could have been just as happy if it were done by someone else. Did you screw something up? Acknowledge that it happened, feel what you need to feel, make it right, and move on. Understand that while your mistakes may indicate something about your current capacity and skill set, they do not indicate something about your value as a human being. You are not your mistakes. Your mistakes are your mistakes. You are not your mistakes. You are not your mistakes. You are not your mistakes. You are not your mistakes. You are not your mistakes. You are not your mistakes. You are not you. They are just steps along your journey toward the Tao. Keep a sense of awe about the Tao. If you don't feel that sense of awe, study and meditate on the nature of the Tao. This can help you to more rightly see your path toward the Tao and the place you can find in it. Being overbold and confident is deadly. The wise use of caution will keep you alive. One is the way to death and the other is the way to preserve your life. Who can understand the workings of heaven? The Tao of the universe does not compete, yet wins. Does not speak, yet responds. Does not command, yet is obeyed. And does act, but is good at directing. The nets of heaven are wide, but nothing escapes its grasp. There are certainly advantages to being brave, but an excess of bravery without the temperance of wisdom and caution can lead to problems. All bravery is not created equally. I think one way to evaluate the nature of our bravery is to look at its motivations. Are we brave in order to gratify our egos? Do we do brave things from a sense of grandeur or self-importance? Or are we brave when the situation calls for it, simply because we understand that something needs to be done? Is our bravery brave for the sake of accomplishing something important or for the sake of proving something to ourselves or others? The Tao certainly doesn't do anything, in order to prove itself. Even though it takes care of everything in the universe, it does not resist obscurity. In fact, it chooses it. Moving farther down into the chapter, we read a couple of these interesting paradoxes of the Tao. The first of these paradoxes seemed to jump out at me a little bit. The Tao does not compete, yet wins. It is always triumphant, and yet it does not get caught up in competition or power struggles. It accomplishes everything by virtue of what it is. I heard an interesting perspective this last week. I was told that Tao is a very powerful, powerful, and powerful being. I think it was from an interview between Malcolm Gladwell and David Epstein, where someone said something to the point of, I think that this is a pretty decent representation of what it is like to follow the Tao. Just as the Tao does not accomplish its ends through strenuous competition, if we are following the personal path laid out for us by Tao, there will be a lot of times when it will seem like we are working really hard because of it. But if we are not, then we will not be getting done. But in actuality, it doesn't feel to us like we are working hard at all. I have seen this dramatically in my own life over the course of this Tao Te Ching daily upload challenge. I have worked many different jobs in my life, mostly revolving around IT and computers. My last quote unquote real job was as a network technician at a local school district. Although I didn't mind the people at the job, and there were some things I liked about it, one thing I noticed was that it always felt like I had to just force myself through the work. Like I was always having to just put my head in the air, and I was always having to put my head in the air, and I was always having to head down and slog through it. I noticed this with a lot of the jobs that I've held in the past. During the course of this challenge, I've noticed an interesting thing though. I recently was just listening to a presentation from Mike Duncan at a book signing he did a few years back. Now, if you don't know who Mike Duncan is, in my opinion, he is one of the greatest history writers and podcasters I know of. I've been pretty engrossed in his Revolutions podcast for about two years now, and I really admire him for the detailed, well-informed, and well-spoken narratives he uses to lay out so many of the amazing and amazing things that he does. He really just makes you feel like you're reading a great book of fiction, but the stories are real. Anyway, I remember hearing him say how much he writes in a given week for the podcast, and suddenly realizing that I write about the same amount for the Dao De Jing challenge, which is crazy to me because that's his job, and for me it's just kind of a hobby. But when I write, it usually doesn't feel like hard work. Often, I'll work straight through meals without even realizing. Some days, I just get so caught up it doesn't feel like work at all. Now I do need to add some caveats here lest any of you take this out of context. I am not, repeat, not telling anybody that they should quit their job to go change to something else. That is a very personal decision that is so dependent on individual circumstances and intuition that it would be incredibly irresponsible of me to make a recommendation like that. I'm also not making some kind of claim that if you just find your true calling, it'll always be easy, and it'll never feel like work, and everything will always go great. Writing comes pretty easy to me now, but it wasn't always like that. I used to go literal months or even up to a year without uploading because I just couldn't face the idea of starting another script. I believe that writing feels this way now, partly because it's where my path has led me for now, but also largely due to the fact that I felt impressed to start this challenge of daily uploads. Before this challenge, I was never very consistent about uploading, but I do think that the exposure of just writing every single day no matter what has helped to make it so that it feels a lot easier now. Writing hasn't always been easy, but through following my intuition and walking my own personal path that Dao has shown me, it now feels that way. I guess it's just one of those things that it's hard to explain if you haven't experienced it for yourself. I have tried to force things that weren't on my path before, and it feels totally different. There's a difference between working at something that you were meant to do and trying to force something that isn't on your path. It's something that you'll have to learn for yourself. Just please don't go quit your job and sort of screw around with a hobby and then blame me that it didn't work out. This is far from the truth. What I am saying is that we all have the ability to respond to intuition, and that we can know for ourselves if we're on the right path for us. If you don't know whether or not you're on the right path, start meditating on this, or praying if that's your thing. And then just listen. Listen as you go about your life. Be attentive to the feelings that come and the thoughts that seem to call you in certain directions. You can know a thought to go in a certain direction is good because it will feel like peace. If you're feeling that you need to be more positive, make up your mind that you'll do whatever it takes to get on that right path, and the next step will become apparent to you. Again, you'll know it's the right thing because it will feel like peace. Not comfort, not even necessarily excitement, but peace. You can feel peace while doing something uncomfortable or even unpleasant. If men are not afraid to die, it is no avail to threaten them with death. If men live in constant fear of dying, and if breaking the law means that a man will be killed, who will dare to break the law? There is always an official executioner. If you try to take his place, it is like trying to be a master carpenter and cutting wood. If you try to cut wood like a master carpenter, you will only hurt your hand. This chapter is a bit interesting because it isn't super clear how it is meant to be interpreted. Some say that this chapter is allowed to advocate for the death penalty. Others say that it is allowed to discouraging it. For those who see this chapter as supporting the death penalty, the first part of this chapter is taken as saying that if people are in constant fear of death from breaking the law, then nobody will dare to break it. They then look at the second part of the chapter, the part about the executioner, and see in it the meaning that there is always an official executioner appointed by the government, and that this person is a master in his craft, and that those who are not experienced in it should not attempt it. While when a person is considered a master carpenter, this chapter is taken as a statement of the fact that this person is a master in his craft, and that those who are not experienced in it should not attempt it. So there's one interpretation. On the other hand, it is possible to interpret this chapter in a largely opposite sense, as a criticism of the death penalty. Those who see this meaning in the chapter look to the first few lines. If men are not afraid to die, it is no avail to threaten them with death. The second interpretation of the chapter holds that the death penalty is not always effective as a means of intimidation, because some people are not afraid to die. Going on to the second part of the chapter, this point of view holds that the official executioner Lao Tzu refers to is nature. Nature is the one true executioner, and trying to be the judge of when people live or die runs contrary to nature and should not be attempted. I'm not going to give an opinion either way on this matter. I just think it's worth pointing out both sides of the argument so that you can make up your own mind about what's being said. Why are the people starving? Because the rulers eat up the money in taxes. Therefore, the people are starving. Why are the people rebellious? Because the rulers interfere too much. Therefore, they are rebellious. Why do the people think so little of death? Because the rulers demand too much of life. Therefore, the people take death lightly. Having little to live on, one knows better than to value life too much. This chapter builds off the one before it. Whereas yesterday Lao Tzu discussed how complicated the death penalty can be, this chapter builds on this theme of taking death lightly. There are many reasons why a population goes hungry. But one reason, especially in ancient times, or under authoritarian governments, is overtaxation. I'd like to think that in our time, democratic mechanisms usually stopped taxes from getting this bad. But in Lao Tzu's time, these political mechanisms did not. And rulers could sometimes become extreme burdens upon their people. This runs totally contrary to Lao Tzu's ideal, which is for a ruler to take responsibility for nurturing and protecting the people. This ideal fits in with the idea of the king as a sort of father protector, which was a big part of the appeal for having a king in ancient and feudal society. However, as we know, kings and rulers did not always fulfill this role, and could sometimes make life extremely hard on those they ruled. As these abuses continued, people began to think that the king was a good man. People became disenchanted with the father protector idea. And now, government tends to look a lot different in the developed world. But this was all well after Lao Tzu's time, and so Lao Tzu gives a lot of advice for how these rulers ought to conduct themselves. He constantly urges them not to impose themselves upon those they rule, but to take care of them, and to treat the people's lives as if they were their own. This advice applies to us today as well, whether we lead or not. Don't impose yourself on others. Look for what you can do for them. Rather than see what you can do for them. Instead, look at what they can do for you. Make their needs equal with your own. Going back to the relationship between rulers and subjects, when rulers make life intolerable for those they rule, these people begin to take death more lightly. They do not hold on so tightly to lives that have ceased to feel as if they were worth living. Therefore, they are more inclined to put their lives in jeopardy by rising up against the rulers who made their lives so intolerable. If we treat people with respect, they will usually respect us. If we do not, they will resist us. This lesson seems like it should be common sense, but history continues to show us that humanity has yet to learn it. I do not think that society will be able to improve or advance in any meaningful way until this basic lesson is integrated. We may make technological, medical and social advances, but all of these advances will fail to create a good society if our basic morality is still unchanged. One bad apple spoils the bunch, and morality is a pretty big apple. It tends to influence the society. It tends to influence every aspect of our society and our lives. In order for our society to improve, its people and leaders must improve first. The irony of all this, of course, is that great suffering at the hands of bad governments, or just suffering in general, can teach us lessons that can sometimes be hard to learn otherwise. In this case, the lesson of not valuing our lives too much. Surrendering to the fact that our lives and the lives of those around us are transient and can leave us at any time is one of the basic principles of Taoism, and leads to increased peace. But this lesson, ironically, is hardest to learn when our lives are going well. When our lives are pleasant, we hold onto them all the more. This is another example of how bad circumstances can sometimes bring about good outcomes. It would of course be best if we could learn this lesson even while our lives were going well, but it remains true that sometimes adversity is the best teacher. The lessons we learn in the worst times of our lives sometimes are the ones that bring us the most benefit. So throughout our discussions of politics and society and how to make the best ones possible, we need to remember that perhaps suffering is not only unavoidable, but is part of the plan. Not that we shouldn't try to live our lives in ways that minimize our suffering and the suffering of others, but at the end of the day we should remember that all political systems are imperfect because they make use of imperfect people, and every government will have issues. In politics, as in life, I don't think it's possible to avoid suffering altogether. Unlike some philosophies which seek to transcend or eliminate suffering, Taoism acknowledges the reality of suffering. It teaches us not to resist it, but to accept it, adapt to it, and learn from it. The living are soft and yielding. The dead are rigid and stiff. Living plants are flexible and tender. The dead are brittle and dry. Those who are stiff and rigid are the disciple of death. Those who are soft and yielding are the disciples of life. Those who are rigid and stiff will be broken. The soft and yielding will overcome. Okay, so as you guys know, we are nearing the end of the Tao Te Ching Explained series. Following this series, my plan is to transition to fewer, higher quality uploads, where I can go more in depth on topics that I think are especially important. I already have quite a few topics in mind that I'd like to cover in these deeper videos, and this topic is one of them. Because of this, I'm not going to go super deep into this subject, but I'm going to go into it in a few minutes. I'm going to go into it in a few minutes. I'm going to go into it in a few minutes. I'm going to go into it in a few minutes. I'm going to go into it in a few minutes. I'm going to go into it in a few minutes. I'm going to go into it in a few minutes. This subject now because I'd like to cover it more in a longer and better produced video. So just know that one thing you can most likely look forward to at the end of the Tao Te Ching series is an in-depth practical guide on how to use Wu Wei in your life. If you guys do have any requests about videos you'd like to see done, you can put them in the comments if you want, and I'll at least consider it. So with that said, let's talk a little bit about flexibility. When people really make up their minds to accomplish something, they often go about it in a very specific way. This way usually involves a strong, steadfast determination to hold rigorously to some kind of schedule, plan, or goal in order to achieve the thing they are trying to do. Think New Year's resolutions, diet plans, exercise goals, plans to quit smoking, that kind of thing. But when we go about our goals in this way, we often go a little too far with them. Often, in our attempt to focus on persistence, we forget to remain open to new ways to accomplish the goal that we might not have considered. Now, it's undeniable that persistence is an important part of achieving any goal, with or without Wu Wei. If your goal is to quit smoking, for example, there is just no getting around the fact that you will have to not smoke every day. This takes persistence. Wu Wei does not deny this. However, when we adhere to Wu Wei, we are sure not to make persistence an end in and of itself. We use it as a tool, not as a way to prove ourselves or to gratify our egos. Some people get so committed to the idea of hard work and persistence, that hard work becomes the goal, not the tool. Such people will often spend their whole lives working hard, never to actually see the benefits of this work. When Wu Wei is a part of our lives, we couple our hard work with flexibility. Flexibility allows us to see the options around us and to use our hard work where it will make the most difference. Often, the best path to a goal is not the most direct one. We try to meet goals like we build highways, in one straight line toward our destination, cutting through terrain. Disregarding the lay of the land. We do this because we think it is faster, but faster is not always better. Often, the best way to our goals is more like a forest path, which weaves in and out of trees, around rocks, over streams. If you look at examples of people who achieve things we admire in our society, you often see them not taking the most direct path. For example, scientists have found that elite athletes often spend less time in deliberate practice of a single sport early in their athletic development. Often, these athletes will have a lot of time to spend on their own work, and they will not be able to do it. They will have a sort of testing period, where they will spend time on several different sports before they settle on one. Elite musicians also do this. Studies have found that many of the best musicians will try out two or three different instruments before they find the one they like. We would tend to think that this would be detrimental to their careers, because it comes out to less time spent on their sport or instrument of choice. However, the time these athletes and musicians take to sample different options often allows them to find a better fit for them, and reduces the chance of burnout later down the road. Their flexibility ultimately enables their persistence. Sometimes, we think that we know exactly what we need to do in order to accomplish something, but often we just don't. Sometimes, we are even wrong about what it is we want to accomplish. Often, we think that we have found our true calling, but maybe it's just a step along the road to something even greater. Flexibility allows us to navigate this path without getting stuck on one particular section of it for longer than necessary. The Tao of Heaven is like the bending of a bow. What is high is brought down. What is low is sent high. What's excessive is reduced. What's insufficient is increased. The Tao of Heaven takes from those who have too much, and gives to those who are in want. The people's way is not like that. They take from those who are in want, and give to those who have too much. Yet who is able to have enough to give it to the world? Only the one who has Tao. Therefore, the sage toils, but expects no praise. He does his work, but does not dwell on it. He does not wish to make a display of his merit. We've talked a lot in this series so far about how the sage takes the needs of others and treats them like his or her own. Laozi speaks of the bending of a bow. When a bow is drawn, the top and bottom are both drawn toward the middle. What is high is made low, and what is low is made high. I don't think this image is only some kind of economic theory. While this idea certainly can't apply to helping those who are economically disadvantaged, it can apply to everything we do. Whatever we have a lot of, whether that be money, talent, knowledge, even humor, we can share this gift with others. Everyone has something more abundantly than those around him or her. Whatever it is we are abundant in, these things have value to others, and should be shared. With all that said, Laozi poses this question. Is there anybody who has abundantly enough to share their excess with the whole world? Is this even possible? It is only possible, he claims, if such a person is one with Tao. Anyone else who seeks to change the entire world will probably cause more harm than good. The Tao is the only thing that can supply enough excess for the entire world to benefit from. To think that we can do this on our own is foolishness. The sage understands this. Thus, he or she is focused on being one with Tao. And when this is done, he enjoys the increased capacity that the Tao brings. Because he does not desire to have more than others, he is not concerned with praise or taking credit for what he does. When he has done a task, he takes joy in it and then moves on to the next task. His motivation is not to impress others, but to emulate Tao. Water is the softest and most yielding substance. Yet nothing is better than water for overcoming the hard and rigid world. Because nothing can compete with it. Everyone knows that the soft and yielding overcomes the rigid and hard. But few can put this knowledge into practice. Therefore, the master says, Only he who is the lowest servant of the kingdom is worthy to become its ruler. He who is willing to tackle the most unpleasant tasks is the best ruler in the world. True sayings seem contradictory. Be like water, my friend. We all know the Bruce Lee quote. But it's much easier to recite the quote than it is to put it into practice. We usually like to cast ourselves in the anime protagonist role. As the character who overcomes impossible odds through sheer grit and determination. If things went our way, the entire world would be a canvas on which we'd paint our life's work. Shaping and changing the world to suit our own opinions and desires. Water does the opposite. Laozi praises the attributes of water through multiple chapters of the Tao Te Ching. Water does not resist change. When a stone falls into it, it moves out of the way and lets the stone pass. When it's cold outside, water freezes. When it gets very hot, it vaporizes. It's partially the changeability of water that allows it to support life on our planet. It allows itself to change states in order to condense, move around the earth, and fall into places where it's needed. Water isn't picky. It gives life to all people and all creatures, regardless of rank, nationality, or race. It is very much like the Tao in this way. The Tao nourishes and supports all who seek it. Like water, it does not seek recognition or glory, yet it takes care of all things. The changeability and adaptability of water does not stop it from being strong, however. Water is one of the principal forces for shaping the world as we know it. Through erosion, water can eventually overcome entire mountains, carve out valleys, or make beautiful works of art. But, the Tao is not good enough to change. The crazy thing about water, though, is that it shapes and changes the world by first yielding to it. Raindrops erode rocks over time, but they do this by yielding to wind and gravity. Water generates no motion in and of itself. It is acted upon by universal forces, and through these forces does its work. When water carves out a valley, it is by running along the natural path as dictated by gravity. It changes the land by first yielding to it. Human beings, unlike water, have the ability to generate motion, to act, rather than only to be acted upon. However, in all our acting, we would do well to remember the example of water, to temper our action with patience and softness. Only when we do this will we be able to act optimally. When great enemies settle their quarrel, some of their enmity will linger on. Is there a way to set things right? The sage abides by the agreement and does not seek to assign blame. People of virtue meet their obligations. Those without virtue exact their claims. The Tao of Heaven does not take sides, yet it always stays with the good. Some of the most difficult challenges to navigate in life are those that have to do with relationships. When you're dealing with relationships, you're not only having to deal with yourself and all your issues, but with a whole other person and all their issues. You have the challenge of having to reconcile two very different worldviews. Even the challenge of understanding the other person's point of view is difficult. Our opinions matter a great deal to us, and we will defend them, sometimes literally to the death. When two people are having a hard time reconciling their opinions, an argument often breaks out. These arguments can continue on perpetually if we do not take steps to resolve them. But even after an argument's resolution, deep-seated resentment can still remain. The Tao sets an example for us of caring for all things, and taking the needs and interests of others as our own. Therefore, Lao Tzu advised, when a resolution is reached, hold up your end of the bargain with exactness, and don't worry too much about what the other person does. As your mom probably told you when you were fighting with your sibling, mind your own business. But Sanjoy, you ask, isn't it my business if someone doesn't hold up their end of a bargain with me? Well, no. It's really not. What is your business? Is everything that affects you your business? Well, if that's the case, then pretty much everything in the world is your business. Because pretty much everything that happens, no matter how insignificant, has a long cause and effect chain that will eventually end up affecting you. Oxford Languages defines business as 1. A person's regular occupation, profession, or trade 2. An activity that someone is engaged in 3. A person's concern and 4. work that has to be done. 5. Matters that have to be attended to Well, obviously, it isn't your occupation or trade to ensure that everything in the world goes to plan. It's also not something that you can realistically expect to be engaged in. You could argue that since everything in the world affects you, then everything in the world is your concern. Well, that may be true, but most of these things lie out of your control, and therefore your being concerned about them offers no benefit to you whatsoever. Whether or not a person chooses to uphold a bargain they have made with you, falls under this category of things that affect you, but over which you have no control. You can reason with a person, you can plead with them, you can yell and scream at them, but at the end of the day, you cannot force them to act in your interests. The only thing you have control over in this situation is how you hold up your end of the bargain. Often, when we concern ourselves with treating other people fairly and rightly, we find that we get this in return from them. Nobody likes a person who goes around tallying up all the things that are owed to them. It's not always the case that people will return good for good, and we shouldn't expect that to happen by default. But often, this is the case. At the end of the day, all we can do is our part. Finally, I think this last paragraph is worth noting. The translation we use today says, The Tao of Heaven does not take sides, yet it always stays with the good. However, the J.H. Macdonald translation, which I also appreciate, puts it like this, The Tao does not choose sides. The good person receives the good. The Tao receives the good because she is on its side. The Tao is not partial. It does not pick favorites. It does not choose whether or not to be on our side. The Tao is neutral. The person who has made up their mind to follow Tao does not benefit from the Tao because the Tao has decided to make them its special favorite. They benefit because they have chosen Tao. The choice of which side to be on does not rest with Tao, but rather with us. When we choose to honor our agreements with others, When we treat others as we would want to be, When we choose to treat ourselves, When we take other people's needs as our own, We choose Tao. May we all do this. A small country has fewer people. Though there are machines that can work ten to a hundred times faster than man, they are not needed. The people take death seriously and do not travel far. Though they have boats and carriages, no one uses them. Though they have armor and weapons, no one displays them. Men return to the knotting of rope in place of riding. Their food is plain and good. Their clothes fine but simple. Their homes secure. They are happy in their ways. Though they live within sight of their neighbors, and crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way, yet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die. The Tao of the Taoist The Tao of the Taoist In this chapter, it seems that we get a bit of a look into Lao-tzu's ideal world. We see glimpses of a country where people are not rushed, and where they embrace the simplicity in life, and don't have a need to travel to different places. People renounce war and live in peace. Many political, economic, and philosophical theories have been made on how this could be achieved. However, every known attempt at a utopian society has failed, because they just keep running up against the same old problem of human nature. You can have the best social or economic life, but you can't have the best social or economic life. You can have the best social or economic life. You can have the best social or economic life. But inevitably, some chump is just going to ruin it for everyone. Or, you know, just kind of everyone ruins it for everyone. All that aside, though, this doesn't mean that there aren't things that we can do to introduce more peace, simplicity, and self-sufficiency into our lives. I made a whole 12 minute video on simplifying our lives, which I'll link in the description, and actually, I think it's one of my better ones, so you should really go watch it. It's probably not feasible for all of us to go live on homesteads, as nice as that would be. It's probably not feasible for all of us to go live on homesteads, as nice as that would be. But, there are things we can do to get ourselves more in touch with nature and natural simplicity. But, there are things we can do to get ourselves more in touch with nature and natural simplicity. For example, a lot of communities have allotment programs. These are usually quite affordable, and they sometimes even have people available to train you on how to garden is you don't know anything about it you don't know anything about it. If you don't want to garden, one simple thing you can do is take regular time to get out in nature. If you don't want to garden, one simple thing you can do is take regular time to get out in nature. Just find a spot where you can be alone and outside with as much nature as possible. If the only accessible nature you have is a city park, then fine. Use that. Just find a spot where you can be alone and outside with as much nature as possible. We spend so much time being overstimulated by our endless consumption of media and noise. Our brains really aren't designed for this. It's only in the last hundred years that humans have ever had any kind of screen to look at at all. That's nowhere near enough time for our bodies and brains to evolve. The pace of our changing world has begun to seriously outstrip the pace at which our bodies can adapt to it. It's important to have at least some time during the day where you can touch grass and put your brain at rest. As much as we can, we should try to simplify our lives and be content with this simplicity. We run our lives at a breakneck pace and then try and plan vacations in order to wind back down, but what if we just tried to cultivate lives that we didn't feel like we needed vacations from? What if we could just simplify our lives to the point that they weren't so exhausting? This will probably look different for different people, but just try and consider if there are things in your life that you could offboard to make it a little less hectic. In life, there are good things, better things, and best things. We have a tendency to put off the best things so that we can pack in more good things. This is obviously backwards. We need to cut down on the good things so that we can have room for the best things. We need enough unstimulated time in our lives so that we can be open to hearing our intuitions. Intuition will help us to know what things in our lives are most important. Truthful words are not beautiful. Beautiful words are not truthful. Good men do not argue. Good men do not argue. Those who argue are not good. Those who know are not learned. The learned do not know. The sage never tries to store things up. The more he does for others, the more he has. The more he gives to others, the greater his abundance. The Tao of Heaven is pointed but does no harm. The Tao of the Sage is work without effort. Welp, you guys, this is it. The final chapter. It's taken us a little over three months and 87 videos, but we have finally reached the end of the Tao Te Ching. Lao Tzu doesn't really leave us with any parting words of farewell, but he does reiterate on several important points that have been covered throughout the body of the text. Truthful words are not beautiful. Beautiful words are not truthful. Often the things that are most important for us to hear will seem abrasive or unpleasant. Sometimes the truths we need the most will be the hardest ones to accept. Sometimes the truths we need the most will be the hardest ones to accept. Sometimes the truths we need the most will be the hardest ones to accept. If someone is expounding to us a philosophy that always feels pleasant and comfortable, it is probably skimming over the inconvenient facts that ultimately will cause the most improvement in our lives. Lao Tzu also advises us not to argue with each other, and warns us of the dangers of equating scholarly knowledge with actual wisdom. We are also advised not to spend our efforts amassing treasures and possessions, but to spend our time and energy helping others. I appreciate the line that says, The more he does for others, the more he has. We tend to look at giving and helping as a zero-sum game. The more I give to you, the less there is for me. But the Tao Te Ching rejects this notion. According to Lao Tzu, giving and helping is a positive-sum game. The more is given to others, the more there is for the self. The actual mechanics of how this all works may seem a little mysterious, and rightly so. If I can add a bit of my own interpretation here, I can think of at least one way that this ends up being the case. When we live our lives with no other object than to satiate our own cravings for comfort, luxury, and safety, we fight a losing battle. The most miserable people I have ever met are almost invariably those who seek their own comfort above all else. This is partly because our comfort and pleasure levels do not remain static, but follow a moving baseline. Whatever was pleasurable yesterday becomes less pleasurable the more times we do it. Therefore, no amount of comfort or pleasure will ever be enough to satisfy us. If we have dedicated our lives to the pursuit of pleasure or comfort alone. Also, I am of the notion that we live in a universe that is far less concerned with our comfort than it is with our development. Because of this, events and circumstances will continually harass us at the borders of our comfort zones, until we finally capitulate and step out of them. Fighting against the universe is a very futile proposition, and it's just not very fun. If we instead choose voluntarily to forsake our own comfort and seek to fulfill our purpose, we will be in a state of total destruction. If we seek to be more than just a tool to help others, we will find the satisfaction that comes along from going with the flow of the stream that our lives are meant to flow in. We will find that, far from diminishing, our pleasure begins to increase. If we seek that pleasure itself, it remains ever elusive. If we just seek to follow our specific path to Tao, we get the pleasure thrown in. Thus, by following Tao, which involves caring for others, we find there is more left over for us. The duties we perform on our way to Tao may require work. They may require work, but they won't feel like strain or forcing. If not always easy, they will feel natural and right. It will feel like our lives are on the right path. Okay, well, that is just about it for us in the Tao Te Ching series. Now, I do say just about, because I'm still planning on at least one more piece of Tao Te Ching content. I am going to take a bit of a hiatus for a few days, but then I'm going to start work on a video that I intend to be a sort of guide to what I consider to be the main takeaways from the Tao Te Ching. I'm going to start with a video that I intend to be a sort of guide to what I consider to be the main takeaways from the Tao Te Ching. I'm going to start with a video that I intend to be a sort of guide to what I consider to be the main takeaways from the Tao Te Ching. I'm going to spend a little extra time on this video, so it will be a little longer coming out than usual, but hopefully it will be worth the wait. In the meantime, the best way to stay connected with me will be through the Discord. I'll still be in there being at least somewhat active, so please feel free to jump in and ping me or send me a DM. I would love to hear from you guys. The last thing I want to say is that I am just very grateful for the support that you guys have shown throughout the series. The channel and Discord have both grown, and I've learned a lot about Taoism, about making videos, and just life lessons in general. Seeing you guys take the time to write nice stuff in the comments or come say hi in the Discord has really meant a lot to me. It really helps me out a lot. So I will see you all when I see you, and in the meantime, I'm going to buckle down and go over like 90,000 words of material to try and pull out what I think is most worth knowing from the Tao Te Ching, and I will see you all whenever I'm done with that. Peace and blessings.",

These users are characterized by their high purchasing power and willingness to spend on quality products. The platform is known for its friendly and supportive community, which contrasts with other platforms where users might encounter more criticism. For instance, celebrities like Yang Li and Li Xiaolu, who face backlash on other platforms, receive positive feedback on Xiaohongshu. This supportive environment makes Xiaohongshu an ideal platform for new content creators to attract a high-quality audience. The platform's strong 'planting grass' (recommendation) capability is highly valued by advertisers, especially in beauty, skincare, and lifestyle sectors. Understanding the user demographics and their interests, such as beauty, fitness, and home decor, is crucial for content creators aiming to monetize their presence on Xiaohongshu."

        "Content": "Monetizing on Xiaohongshu can be approached in two primary ways: through direct product sales or by leveraging the platform to attract advertising deals. For those with their own products, Xiaohongshu serves as a powerful channel to attract high-quality users through targeted content. This approach does not necessarily require a large follower base but rather a highly engaged and relevant audience. On the other hand, content creators without their own products can monetize through advertising deals, live streaming, and affiliate marketing. The value of an account is determined by its engagement metrics, such as likes, comments, and shares, rather than just follower count. High engagement rates can command higher advertising rates. Additionally, maintaining consistent and high-quality content is essential to attract and retain advertisers. Content creators should also consider diversifying their presence across multiple platforms to maximize their reach and revenue potential."

        "Content": "When a PR approaches you for an advertising collaboration, there are several steps to follow. First, the PR will inquire about your rates. Then, you provide a quote and your available schedule for publishing the advertisement. After that, you wait for the PR to confirm whether the collaboration can proceed. Once confirmed, you will finalize the collaboration details and agree on a publication date. Next, you start creating the content, which involves deciding on the topic, drafting an outline, writing the script, and designing the video cover. Finally, you publish the note and handle the payment settlement. Each step requires clear communication and adherence to deadlines to ensure a smooth collaboration."

Start by identifying the core message or theme of your content and then tailor it to fit the specific platform. For example, a video that performs well on TikTok might need adjustments to be effective on Instagram or YouTube. Consider the unique features and audience preferences of each platform. On TikTok, short, engaging videos with quick edits and trending music might work best, while on YouTube, longer, more detailed content could be more effective. Additionally, repurpose content by changing the format; a successful video can be turned into a blog post, infographic, or social media post. This approach not only saves time but also ensures that your content reaches a broader audience. Use analytics to track performance across platforms and refine your strategy based on the results."

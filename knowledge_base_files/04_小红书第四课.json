        "Content": "Selecting hot topics for your content is crucial for gaining traction and engagement. Here are three principles to follow: 1) Ensure the topic has received at least 500 likes, or ideally 1000 likes, within the past week. This indicates that the topic is currently popular and has a high engagement rate. 2) The topic should be recent, appearing within the last week. This ensures that the content is timely and relevant. 3) Check if similar topics have also gained traction recently. For example, if a post about sixth-grade math has received over 1000 likes, search for related keywords and see if other posts in the same category are also performing well. If these criteria are met, the topic is likely a good choice for your content."

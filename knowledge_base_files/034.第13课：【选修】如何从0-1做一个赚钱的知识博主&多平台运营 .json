        "Content": "To become a knowledge influencer from scratch, it's essential to overcome self-doubt and start taking action. Many people hesitate because they feel their knowledge is insufficient or that their content won't be valuable. However, if you enjoy sharing, thinking, and learning, you can succeed on platforms like Xiaohongshu or others. Begin by identifying your unique positioning and consistently producing content to build your personal brand. It's crucial to practice regularly, absorb new knowledge, and convert it into valuable content. Over time, this will help you establish trust and a loyal audience. Remember, even small achievements can be significant. For example, if you consistently wake up early and document your journey, you can inspire others who struggle with the same issue. The key is to start, make progress, and share your experiences, no matter how small they may seem."

The process starts with finding your unique positioning, which differentiates you from others. This positioning should be reinforced through consistent content output, helping to establish your IP image and build trust with your audience. The next step is to leverage different platforms to amplify your reach and attract more followers. Each platform has its own rules and audience, so it's essential to adapt your content accordingly. Finally, the ultimate goal of a knowledge IP is to achieve stable monetization. This can be done by creating a range of products or services, such as courses, consultations, or other offerings that align with your expertise.

        "Content": "An effective multi-platform content strategy involves understanding the unique characteristics of each platform and tailoring your content to fit. Start by focusing on one platform that aligns with your content style and audience. For example, if you create video content, you might begin with Xiaohongshu and then distribute the same content to other platforms like Bilibili, Douyin, and Xigua Video. Each platform has its own ecosystem and user behavior, so it's important to adjust your content slightly to fit these nuances. For instance, longer videos might perform well on Bilibili but not on Douyin. Additionally, platforms like Bilibili allow for more direct audience interaction, such as setting up automatic replies to new followers, which can help build a stronger community. By strategically distributing your content across multiple platforms, you can maximize your reach and engagement, ultimately driving more traffic and conversions."

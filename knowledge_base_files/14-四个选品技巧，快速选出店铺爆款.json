            "Content": "To quickly identify potential bestsellers for your store, consider these four product selection techniques: \n1. Cross-Platform Selection: Identify trending products on other platforms like Douyin, Taobao, or Pinduoduo, and replicate them in your store. For example, if you see a popular phone case on Douyin, take a screenshot and search for the same product on 1688 or Pinduoduo. Ensure the product has good reviews and no signs of fake orders before adding it to your store. Note that Xiaohongshu does not allow text on the main product image, so you may need to change the image. \n2. Keyword Selection: Find products based on high-search-volume keywords. For example, use specific keywords like 'sexy mid-length dress' to find products that match the search criteria closely, leading to higher conversion rates. \n3. Audience-Based Selection: Choose products based on the interests and behaviors of your target audience. For example, if your audience is interested in yoga, consider selling yoga mats, yoga socks, or resistance bands. Use the user data from Xiaohongshu's merchant management backend to understand your audience's demographics and preferences. \n4. Testing New Products: Continuously introduce new products and use Xiaohongshu's data center to monitor their performance. This method relies on probability and can help you discover unexpected bestsellers. The advantage is that you won't miss any potential hits, but it requires more investment."

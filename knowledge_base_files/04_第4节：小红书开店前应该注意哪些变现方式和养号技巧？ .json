        "Content": "Before setting up a shop on Xiaohongshu, it's crucial to understand the different types of shops available and their respective rules. There are personal shops, which can be opened with just an ID card, and individual shops, which require a business license and can open up to three shops. Then there are enterprise shops, specialty shops, and invitation-only shops, which are suitable for big brands. To choose the right type of shop, first determine what products you want to sell. For example, if you plan to sell luxury goods, a personal shop won't suffice; you'll need at least an individual shop. Understanding these rules helps in selecting the appropriate shop type for your business needs."

For businesses with inventory, it's essential to highlight the unique selling points of your products, such as price advantages or quality guarantees. Ensure your products align with the platform's user preferences and create authentic, relatable content to build trust. For businesses without inventory, start by analyzing the platform's user demographics, which are predominantly female. Choose products that cater to this audience, such as fashion, beauty, and lifestyle items. Conduct thorough market research to identify popular products and find reliable suppliers. Consistently optimize your listings and content to improve visibility and engagement. Both strategies require a deep understanding of the platform and its users to succeed."

When a product is first listed, it has no sales or reviews, which can deter potential buyers. The goal of breaking zero sales is to boost initial sales and build credibility. This can be achieved by sharing the product link with friends and followers on platforms like WeChat, QQ, and Moments. Encourage them to place orders, which can later be refunded if necessary. This method helps create an initial sales record, making the product more appealing to new customers."

            "Content": "The tagging system is crucial for matching your videos with the right audience. When you upload a video, the system analyzes various elements such as the presence of people, pets, activities, and text to assign tags. These tags help the platform recommend your video to relevant viewers. For example, a video featuring a man, a dog, and a woman cooking will be tagged with 'man,' 'dog,' 'woman,' and 'cooking,' and recommended to users interested in these topics."

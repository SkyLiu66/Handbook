            "Content": "Hello everyone, let's continue from the last lesson where we discussed the push mechanism of video accounts. Understanding this mechanism is crucial for successfully growing your account. Many businesses fail because they don't understand how the platform's mechanism works. Once you grasp this, you can tailor your strategies to align with the platform's requirements, enabling rapid growth from zero to one and beyond. This includes strategies for accounts with existing traffic and methods to revive accounts with declining traffic. The key is to continuously optimize your approach to stay competitive."

            "Keywords": ["variables", "account performance", "optimization"],
            "Content": "Two main variables affect account performance: the 'horse race' mechanism and the platform's threshold. The 'horse race' mechanism means that if your competitors are optimizing and you are not, you will fall behind. The platform's threshold, or baseline, adjusts based on overall performance. For example, if many accounts reach a certain level of engagement, the platform will raise the threshold, making it harder to achieve the same results with old methods. This requires continuous optimization and adaptation to stay ahead."

            "Title": "Importance of Private Traffic",
            "Keywords": ["private traffic", "public traffic", "e-commerce"],
            "Content": "Relying solely on public traffic is unsustainable due to the platform's constantly changing mechanisms. Therefore, building private traffic is essential. Private traffic allows you to reach your audience without incurring additional costs and provides more stability. This is why many successful e-commerce businesses focus on developing their private traffic channels."

        "Content": "Creating viral content involves several key strategies. First, ensure your product listings exceed 50 items within the first few days of opening your store. This helps establish a clear store label, which in turn helps the platform assign product labels and push your content. Use market data to select popular categories and subcategories. Tools like Huitun can simplify this process by providing industry traffic data. Focus on subcategories with high readership but fewer competitors. This approach increases your chances of standing out. Additionally, use keywords to find trending products and optimize your listings accordingly. By following these steps, you can create content that is more likely to go viral."

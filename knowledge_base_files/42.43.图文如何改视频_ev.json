Tools like Meitu Xiuxiu can help you edit and enhance these images. Once your images are ready, you can use video editing software like Jianying to compile them into a video. Add transitions, music, and voiceovers to make the video more dynamic. For example, you can add background music and a voiceover to explain the key points of your product. This method not only makes your content more engaging but also allows you to convey more information in a visually appealing format. By following these steps, you can easily convert static images into compelling videos that capture your audience's attention."

Use features like rotation, cropping, and resizing to ensure the image is well-composed. Adjust the brightness, contrast, and color temperature to make the image more vibrant. Adding filters and effects can also enhance the overall look. For example, you can add a cold white effect to make the image look more professional.

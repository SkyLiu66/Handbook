Click on 'My Services' or 'Service Market' to enter the service market interface. Under the 'Chip Services' section, you will find third-party apps for uploading products. One commonly used app is 'Moyi Assistant,' which offers a one-week free trial. Click on 'Moyi Assistant' and proceed to bind your Xiaohongshu store for authentication. After binding, you will be directed to the product upload interface. Here, you can paste up to 100 product links from platforms like Pinduoduo, but it is recommended to paste no more than 10 links at a time to avoid lag. Adjust the product prices as needed, then save the settings. Finally, click 'Upload and Submit' to batch upload your products. Once the upload is complete and approved, you can view the products in the 'Product Management' section of your Xiaohongshu Merchant Management Backend."

            "Content": "When batch uploading products on Xiaohongshu, setting the right prices is crucial. After pasting the product links into the upload interface, you need to adjust the prices according to your profit margin. For example, if a product on Pinduoduo is priced at 9.9 yuan and you want to add a 10 yuan profit margin, you should set the price to 19.9 yuan. Similarly, if you want to add a 20 yuan profit margin, set the price to 29.9 yuan. Ensure that you only adjust the price settings and leave other settings unchanged. Once the prices are set, save the settings and proceed with the batch upload. This method ensures that your products are competitively priced while allowing you to maintain a healthy profit margin."

        "Content": "Using multiple accounts on Xiaohongshu can be an effective strategy to increase your brand's visibility and reach. By distributing content across different accounts, you can target various audience segments and styles. This approach can also save costs, as it allows you to manage several accounts with a small team. Typically, one to two people can handle the operation of these accounts. Initially, you may need to invest time in setting up and populating these accounts with content. However, once they reach a certain level of activity, you can maintain them with periodic updates and collaborations with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs). Regular collaborations with KOLs, such as every three to six months, can keep your brand active and engaging on the platform. This strategy helps in building a robust presence on Xiaohongshu, making your brand more recognizable and influential among local users."

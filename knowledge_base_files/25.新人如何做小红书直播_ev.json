        "Content": "When starting with a new Xiaohongshu account, it is essential to post content that helps the platform understand your niche. Initially, your account is like a blank slate with zero data and followers. By posting notes with relevant images, text, and tags, the platform begins to categorize your account. Each account is unique, and the system's algorithm will tag your account based on the content you post. These tags are dynamic and can change over time. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze the data feedback from your posts and adjust your strategy accordingly. Regularly reviewing and optimizing your content helps in better alignment with the platform's algorithm, leading to improved reach and engagement."

There is so much value in adding a print or a pattern into your look. It's the easiest way of making it seem like you've put real thought into your look of elevating what you're wearing. The easiest way to incorporate print into your current wardrobe and to ease your way in is by finding a print that you can put under something. Ordinarily, one would assume while you're wearing a suit, you'd wear a plain shirt underneath. If I weren't comfortable with print, I would put a printed shirt under my suit to hide away a lot of the print, and I'm just showing a kiss of it. If I'm feeling a lot more bold, I would take off the jacket and mostly show my print. So there's a way of incorporating print that can be done in a subtle way. Also, if you don't want to put it under a jacket, that still feels a little too much for you, maybe try it in the likes of a sock, in a bag, a handbag that you're using, in a scarf that you're using. Just add one element of a print or a pattern that's going to add to that. Just add one element of a print or a pattern that's going to add to that. Just add one element of a print or a pattern that's going to add to that. Just add one element of a print or a pattern that's going to add to that. Add a point of interest to your look. Prints are so personal to a person. Just because I love a print doesn't mean everyone's going to love it. It's not the same as a solid. It's not the same as a neutral, which is to say that most neutrals are universally appealing. Most colors, you can find a shade within that color that is universally appealing. Sometimes that's not the case with a print. Don't be so disheartened if not everyone loves your print. As long as you know that it's a print that makes sense for you and that makes you feel good, go with that print. A lot of people think that you can't mix prints. You can. You can maybe go too bold. I want to show you how to simplify it and make it very much manageable for you. There are certain prints that are classic, that are simple, and these are your foundation prints. A stripe, a polka dot, an animal print, and a floral. I'm wearing this myself. This is a very toned down version. You can go a lot more extreme with your floral, but still, it's a classic print. Now that you're aware of your classic prints, you can then layer on other prints, and I want to show you how. We're going to take a stripe t-shirt, a simple print, and then I'm going to work in a geoprint. A geoprint is a geometric print that repeats over and over again. It's a more contemporary print. And so I'm going to take this shirt, layer it over. I'm going to take the stripe, and that's a way you can mix your prints. One more example. You can mix a plaid. Again, it's a more contemporary print. It's been around for probably 100 years as opposed to some of the others which have been around for a few hundred years. And so we take the plaid. We put it under this so you show just a tiny bit of clashing prints, mixed prints. It's a chic way. It's a classic. It's a way of showing that you know exactly what you're doing with your style because you've gotten to the point where you can mix bold prints. I want to give you another example of this. I pulled out a paisley which is, on its own, a lot of luck. I understand that you may not want to go from solid colors to a paisley. There's a way of toning this down. You can put a sweater over it, a jumper over it, a blazer over it, and that calms the print down. Or if you're already wearing prints and you want to step that up even further, you can add another print to this. Just have a kiss of the paisley in the collar. Wear it under a stripe. And you've found a way to mix prints by mixing a more contemporary print with a classic print. If you're worried that you've gone too far with mixing prints, ask yourself, is there a classic print involved with this look that I have? If not, maybe these two clashing prints are very bold. And if those two bold prints are working against each other, is there a way you can use them where you tone it down? For example, could their colors be somewhat similar so it works together? If they are two very bold clashing prints that aren't basic prints, simple prints, it's probably wise to stay clear of them. There's no print that I would say you can't wear with another print. It all depends on the colors it has, the tone it has, the size it has. It honestly really does come down to what feels right for you. Does it feel like it's too much? Does it feel like it's too bold? Or does it represent you beautifully? If that's the case, who am I to tell you don't wear those two prints together? A really simple way of incorporating something new into your wardrobe without going super bold is changing up simply the textures of the fabric you're wearing. So, for example, if you are always wearing a button-up shirt and you are wearing a simple cotton, let's say to work, instead of just going for a cotton button-up, you could replace it with a linen. The texture of your clothing makes a difference. It makes it hit the light differently. It catches the light differently. It makes your look stand out in a different kind of way. It's no longer just flat. And so, I would like you to start with replacing some of the things that you've worn regularly with things of a different texture. So, if you've always worn a simple overcoat that's in a beautiful wool fabric, and that's the kind of coat you always go for, but you want to step out of your comfort zone, go for something that's a different fabric, go for something that's a little more... Who knows? A fleece. A shearling. Go for options that you haven't worn before, but are very similar silhouettes to the silhouettes you already own. So, you're not investing in something crazy jarring for you. You're not changing who you are. You're not changing into a costume. You're just changing simple pieces that you already wear. You're just changing out the fabric so it's still very much your outfit, but a very different version. In my opinion, there's no fabric or texture that you need to stay away from. If it doesn't feel like it speaks to who you are and the vibe that you're going for, remember, you come up with that rule as to who you want to be. Don't necessarily deviate from that. Don't be this lady if that's absolutely not you. Just stick with textures that make sense for who you are and the vibe you're going for, and you can't go wrong. There's no actual rule as to what textures work for what person. If you find that you've already embraced texture, you've worn that fluffy coat, you've worn that chunky knit sweater, but you want to step out of your comfort zone even further, start to then really mix your textures. There's no right way or wrong way to mix textures. It's just about playing what feels right for you. If, for example, you ordinarily wear an overcoat that has a beautiful texture of wool, but normally you'd wear a very simple plain t-shirt underneath and a pair of jeans, great. However, if you want to switch things up, you could wear another bold texture underneath. If you keep it a very similar color or color story to what you already have as your main piece, it doesn't look as jarring. So the textures work against each other, but in the most beautiful way. It's adding an extra point of interest to your outfit. There are certain pieces that really do make it so easy to match. And that is leather and suede. Yes, I know this is a very bold color. Yes, I know that you may not want a brown. You may want to go for black. This is purely for fabric choice. Go for whatever color you want. But leather and suede is the easiest way to incorporate texture. The reason these are the easiest is because they've been around for so, so, so long. These are what you would find in a capsule collection. So you know that they've been around for decades upon decades, and they go with pretty much everything. I've been wearing this for a long time. I've heard many times that you can't mix leather and suede. It's not a rule. Move on. You can wear leather and suede together. It looks gorgeous. Many people seem to think that if it's not real leather, it's not as chic. That couldn't be further from the truth. And that's the case with fur too. If it's not real fur, it's not chic. That's actually incorrect. Some of the biggest designers on the planet, one of them is Salah McCartney. She uses no real leather, no real fur. It's still a designer piece. It's still beautifully done. So well executed. I promise you, you can find wonderful faux leather and faux fur. Can I bring my leather jacket out? It's a really good example. It's here. I pulled in my moto leather jacket that you'll recognize from my capsule wardrobe. This is a way of adding texture, really simple way of adding in texture. Everything else is super flat. And then I add one point of texture, which is leather. This jacket I've had for so many years. It is, and it still looks so fresh. The reason is because I take care of my leather. The way I keep it looking super fresh is I moisturize my leather. This is real leather. Leather is skin. If your leather starts to look a little bit dated, let's say for example, this leather. If it starts to look like it's a little too vintage and it looks like it's seen much better days, if you add a really good moisturizer that you would put on your face the whole thing, it's going to freshen it right up. I put moisturizer on this maybe, I don't know, maybe a week or two. I put this maybe, probably every six months, seven months, and it looks brand new. And I've had it for over a decade.",

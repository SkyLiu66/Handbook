        "Content": "Proper account setup on Xiaohongshu is crucial for the success of your content. If you neglect the basic details during the initial setup, it can hinder your progress even if your content is excellent or you invest in promotions. The platform has strict mechanisms to identify and limit accounts that do not adhere to its guidelines. Therefore, understanding and implementing the correct setup procedures is essential. For instance, if you have an old account that has not violated any rules and has normal traffic, you can use it to post content directly. This saves time and effort compared to starting a new account. However, if you are creating a new account, you must follow specific guidelines such as using a new phone number, ensuring your contact list appears populated, and adhering to the 'one device, one SIM card, one account' principle. These steps help in avoiding restrictions and ensuring your account remains in good standing, thereby increasing the chances of your content gaining traction."

        "Content": "Using an old Xiaohongshu account can be advantageous if it has not been restricted or limited in any way. Old accounts that have been active and have not violated any platform rules generally have higher account weight and can benefit from initial traffic boosts. To determine if your old account is in good standing, you can post a simple piece of content and monitor its performance. If the content receives less than 50 views within the first five minutes or less than 200 views within a day, it is likely that the account is restricted. In such cases, it is advisable to create a new account. If the old account is in good standing, you should remove any unrelated content to maintain the account's purity and focus. This approach leverages the existing account's weight and activity history, providing a solid foundation for new content and increasing the likelihood of gaining visibility and engagement on the platform."

        "Content": "When creating a new Xiaohongshu account, it is important to follow specific guidelines to avoid being flagged as a marketing account. First, ensure that your contact list appears populated by saving random phone numbers with names. This helps the system recognize your account as genuine. Second, adhere to the 'one device, one SIM card, one account' principle. This means using a unique phone number and device for each account and avoiding the use of the same network for multiple accounts. Using mobile data instead of WiFi for new accounts can help in maintaining this principle. Additionally, avoid using virtual phone numbers as they are easily detected and can lead to account restrictions. By following these guidelines, you can create a new account that is less likely to be restricted, ensuring a smoother experience and better chances of success on the platform."

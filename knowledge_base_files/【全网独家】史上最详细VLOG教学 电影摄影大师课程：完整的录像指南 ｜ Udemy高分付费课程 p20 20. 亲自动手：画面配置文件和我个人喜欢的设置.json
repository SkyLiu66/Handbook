It's your camera adjusting the overall sharpness, contrast, saturation, and white balance. The sharpness is how much post processing, I don't know any other word besides sharpness is used, but kind of the clarity that your camera can add to how sharp parts of the image feel. The contrast is the amount of difference between the darkest and the brightest part of the frame. The more contrasty, the more punchy, and the more dark the darks are, the more brights the brights are. The saturation is how much the tones and the colors, how vibrant they are in your image, and then the white balance we'll get into. This is good to keep in mind. This is baked into your footage permanently. So if we are using a picture profile on our camera and it's very contrasty and it's very saturated, we're going to have to combat that or fight that in post production if we want to change the look of the image. So I highly recommend using a flat picture profile for the footage that you're shooting. I haven't seen an app that you can do this with for the phone. So if you do have an idea of an app that does that for smartphones, please share it. But I do use it all the time when I shoot. I pretty much shoot with the same picture profile anytime I'm shooting with my DSLR. Actually, yeah, let me grab this camera real quick and show you guys. So if we see our image here and we go to our. Okay. Picture profile style. We'll be able to see different picture profiles that have different aesthetics. It's a different adjusting on the white balance, the contrast, the saturation, etc. Depending on what kind of camera you're using. You can go to the owner of your camera's website. In this case, it's Canon. And you can Google their flat picture profile for Canon. It's called C log for Sony. I believe it's called S log. It has a different name. Every company has their own picture profile that you can download. They will give you a flat, less affected image going directly into your camera. Okay. So if you don't have that for your camera that you're using, don't worry. I generally shoot with my own profile that I've created. That's really easy. It's just a neutral profile. So if you go into the custom setting that you can be able to do for the camera that you're using the custom, you can always add a custom picture profile. So for mine, I'm going to go with the custom picture profile. Okay. It's neutral. I just go in and I turn down the sharpness. Okay. I turned down the contrast. Okay. Turn down the saturation. And finally, and I leave the color tone as it is. You don't want to really adjust the color tone. That's changing the value of certain colors. It'll make your image too blue. Okay. No. Okay. That is good. Okay. This is good. or purple or green you don't really want to mess with the color tone but the basis is you go into your picture profile setting and you turn everything majority down so you have more information that's unedited to work with in post-production when you do want to edit those things okay and so hopefully that gives you a general understanding of picture profile we'll go into that stuff more when we're actually shooting alongside each other and when I bring on some guests in the course and I'm actually changing these things in real",

The first formula involves using a provocative question that stimulates curiosity. For example, 'Do you know how much a simple beauty treatment can change a woman?' This type of title uses keywords and extreme adjectives to form a question that makes users curious about the answer. The second formula is the 'How-to' format, which explains how to achieve a desirable state. For instance, 'How to decorate your home with $5,000 to look like $30,000.' This format appeals to users' desires to achieve something beneficial. The third formula involves using numbers to list methods, suggestions, or tips, such as 'Three ways to quickly turn around your debt.'

        "Content": "Emotional and conflict-driven titles are effective in capturing user attention and encouraging engagement. One approach is to use scenarios that highlight common conflicts or challenges. For example, 'What to do if you're 30 and haven't achieved anything?' This type of title resonates with users who may be experiencing similar issues, creating a sense of empathy and curiosity. Another approach is to use negative or alarming words to wake up the user's attention. For instance, 'Five things you should avoid in the workplace.' Negative words can trigger a sense of urgency and caution, making users more likely to click and read the content to avoid potential pitfalls. Additionally, using emotional appeal in titles can evoke strong feelings, making the content more relatable and engaging. For example, 'Imagine how happy life would be with both a cat and a dog at home.' This type of title creates a vivid image that appeals to users' emotions, encouraging them to click and explore further."

        "Content": "Leveraging authority and low-cost solutions in titles can significantly enhance user trust and engagement. One effective formula is to mention well-known figures or companies to add credibility to the content. For example, 'The business methods used by Jack Ma.' Mentioning a reputable figure like Jack Ma can attract users who are interested in learning from successful individuals. Another approach is to highlight low-cost solutions that promise high returns. For instance, 'Three steps to easily start a side business.' This type of title appeals to users who are looking for simple and affordable ways to achieve their goals. By providing clear, actionable steps, users feel more confident in their ability to succeed, increasing their likelihood of engaging with the content. Additionally, setting a specific scope and enhancing the perceived value of the content can make it more appealing. For example, 'The work methods of employees at Fortune 500 companies.'

        "Content": "Account nurturing is a crucial step for success on any social media platform, including Douyin, Kuaishou, and Xiaohongshu. Each platform has different requirements for nurturing accounts. For instance, Douyin has relatively low requirements, allowing users to start posting content after just one day of nurturing. In contrast, Xiaohongshu has higher standards, expecting users to be formal and share high-quality content. Therefore, understanding and meeting the specific nurturing requirements of each platform is essential for increasing account weight and visibility. This involves not only following the platform's guidelines but also engaging with the community and producing content that aligns with the platform's standards."

        "Content": "Nurturing an account on Xiaohongshu involves several strategic steps to ensure the account gains traction and visibility. Initially, avoid modifying any account information right after registration. Instead, focus on engaging with the platform by watching and interacting with content. Spend about an hour daily, divided into three sessions, watching system-recommended videos and notes. Ensure you watch content for a reasonable duration to maintain a high play-through rate. Gradually, start interacting with content related to your niche to build account verticality. Follow and engage with 40-50 accounts in your niche to ensure the platform tags your account correctly. This process typically spans five to seven days, with the first three days focusing on general engagement and the subsequent days on niche-specific content."

        "Content": "To increase the chances of successfully nurturing an account, consider managing multiple accounts simultaneously. This approach spreads the risk and increases the likelihood of at least one account gaining traction. When using multiple accounts, adhere to the principle of 'one device, one card, one network, one account' to avoid detection as a marketing account. Use mobile hotspots instead of home Wi-Fi for account registration. Follow the same nurturing process for each account, ensuring consistent engagement and interaction. By nurturing multiple accounts, you can identify which ones perform best and focus your efforts on those, thereby optimizing your resources and increasing the overall success rate."

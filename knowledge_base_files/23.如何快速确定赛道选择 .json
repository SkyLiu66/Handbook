Instead of focusing on a broad category, narrow down your niche to a specific area. For example, within the fashion niche, you could specialize in men's fashion, women's fashion, or even fashion photography. This specialization helps you become an expert in your chosen field, making your content more valuable and credible. To find your sub-niche, research what other creators are doing and identify gaps or areas where you can offer something unique. Look at popular content within your broader niche and see how you can add your own twist. By specializing in a sub-niche, you can create more focused and engaging content that appeals to a specific audience, increasing your chances of success."

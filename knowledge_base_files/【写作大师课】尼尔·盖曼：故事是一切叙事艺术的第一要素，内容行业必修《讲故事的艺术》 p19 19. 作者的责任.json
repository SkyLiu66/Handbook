It wasn't something I thought about to begin with. It wasn't until a man was found dead, believed to be a suicide, with a note on his chest saying that the Sandman did it, and the Sandman would bring perfect peace, and a copy of Sandman by the body, that I had to go, well, hang on, did I do this? What happened? And I had a very, very bad weekend. And then, a few days later, I discovered that actually he wasn't a suicide. He'd been murdered. He'd been murdered by his boyfriend, who had written the note and put the comic there to try and make people think that this was a Sandman-inspired suicide. And the boyfriend also killed himself. And I was very angry. I felt like someone had tried to frame me for murder. But I also thought that the questions that it raised, what is my responsibility, were huge and important questions. And what I decided was, my responsibility is to tell good stories, tell honest stories, tell them as well as I can, tell them to as many people as I can. My responsibility is to encapsulate, as much as I can, the things I believe, and the values that I believe in the stories. But also, having a point of view, being willing to allow other points of view in, to be able to allow characters, who I might not even want to associate with, into my fiction, and to do them justice. Those, I figure, are my responsibility. And that, for me, has to be there at the bottom of everything that I write. So I need to be able to point to good omens and say, yes, it's a farce. It's a silly, funny farce about the end of the world. But absolutely, it has a message. It has a message that I can stand behind. It says that human beings have to be responsible. We have to fix the world. That war is very rarely a good idea. And avoiding war, which rarely gets praised, actually is huge and important. And that, really, we have to remember that the greatest triumphs and the greatest tragedies of the human race are nothing to do with people being basically good or people being basically evil. They're all to do with people being basically people. And so that, I can take a farce, and I can stand behind it. I can say, this, this is something I believe. This is real. I can take a book like Coraline and say, it's filled with scary stuff for kids, absolutely. There are people who feel that is absolutely and utterly inappropriate, and kids should be kept safe from all the darkness and all the terror and all the bad things. And to those people, I say, good luck to you. Although I personally believe that if you are keeping people, young people safe from the darkness, then all you're doing is when the darkness shows up, you are denying them tools or weapons that they might have needed and could have had. But really, it's a book about bravery. It's a book about carrying on. And that, for me, is important. I know I can be responsible with that. So I can absolutely stand by, you know, people are like, how can you write a book of horror for a seven-year-old child? And I can say I can do it as best as I possibly can, because there are kids out there who need to know that they'll get through this. So you've just finished the class. Let me give you some advice. The first question that I get asked all the time is, I am an aspiring writer, what should I do? And I give an answer that is meant absolutely seriously, and some people think it's flippant. It isn't. That answer is, you should write. And some people say, yes, I am already writing. What should I do now? And I say, you should finish things. And some people, again, think I'm joking. But some people go, ah, yes, you have a very good point. I should finish things. And they go off, and now they continue to write, but they start to finish things. Sometimes people need other kinds of advice. I remember a book. I remember Brian Vaughan, a wonderful writer, did Why the Last Man, many other things. When he was very young, he came up to me and he said, what should I do? I want to be a writer, and it isn't happening. And I got him to tell me a little bit about why it wasn't happening for him. And what became apparent from what he was saying was he could write. He could write. He could finish things. He just didn't have anything to say. And I said, good. So what you should do. I said, look, normally I would tell people just to write, just to finish things for you. Go out there into the world. Go get a job. Go get fired from a job. Go get your heart broken. See as much of the world as you can. Find things. Bump into things. Get hurt. Come back in a few years' time, and you will have a lot of work. And you will have a lot of things to write about. And he did. And when he came back and he told me the story, he said, do you tell that to everybody? And I said, no. I tell it to people every now and again when it seems like that's what they need. But it is a really good thing to remember that experience is good. Reading is fantastic. Read everything you can. Write everything you can. But do a lot of living because everything that happens in the living, it's going to wind up in the fiction. It's going to be needed. You are going to need every human being you ever meet. You're going to need everything that you see. Because one day, you'll write a story, and you'll realize that actually you can write the story. Because once, on a mountain top in China, a little man tried to sell you a pot of Snow White honey. He invented the",

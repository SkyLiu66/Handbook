    "Content": "When resolving disputes or disagreements, focus on holding up your end of the bargain and not assigning blame. Emphasize with the other party's perspective and strive for fairness. Remember, not everything that affects you is your business; focus on what you can control and let go of the rest. Treat others as you would like to be treated, and choose to honor agreements. This approach not only resolves conflicts but also fosters goodwill and mutual respect."

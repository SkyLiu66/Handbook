            "Content": "To efficiently match influencers for product promotion, there are four main types of influencers to consider, each suitable for different brand needs and stages. The first type is 'Content Distributors,' where the brand provides the content, and the influencer's role is to distribute it. This method helps create the impression that multiple influencers are endorsing the product, enhancing its credibility. The second type is 'Content Creators,' who have strong content creation skills but may not have a large following. Brands provide the brief, and these influencers create high-quality content. The third type is 'Hybrid Influencers,' who excel in both content creation and product promotion. These influencers are rare on Xiaohongshu and are usually found on platforms like Douyin. The fourth type is 'Live Stream Influencers,' who are highly effective in live streaming and product promotion. When collaborating with these influencers, brands should consider whether to pay a fixed fee or offer a commission-based model. Each type of influencer serves a different purpose and can be strategically used to maximize product exposure and sales."

            "Content": "For brands that already have proven content formats, the 'Content Distributors' strategy involves using influencers to distribute pre-made content. This approach helps diversify the sources of product endorsements, making it appear more credible to users. For example, if a user sees multiple influencers promoting the same product, it reinforces the product's positive reputation. Brands provide the content, and influencers act as distribution channels, ensuring the content reaches a wider audience."

            "Content": "Brands that know their key selling points but lack strong in-house content creation capabilities can collaborate with 'Content Creators.' These influencers may not have a large following but possess excellent content creation skills. Brands provide the brief, and these influencers produce high-quality content that effectively communicates the brand's message. This content can then be promoted to a targeted audience to maximize its impact."

They are more commonly found on platforms like Douyin. When collaborating with hybrid influencers, brands should evaluate the influencer's compatibility with the product and their potential reach. It's essential to negotiate terms that balance content creation fees with performance-based incentives to ensure a cost-effective collaboration."

Collaborating with the right live stream influencer can significantly boost product sales and brand visibility."

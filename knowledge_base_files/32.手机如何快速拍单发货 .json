        "Content": "Managing orders on Xiaohongshu involves a few straightforward steps. First, monitor your Xiaohongshu store for new orders. Once an order appears, you need to source the product from platforms like Taobao, Pinduoduo, 1688, or Douyin. As a dropshipper, you don't hold inventory, so you will purchase the product from these platforms and have it shipped directly to your customer. Copy the order details from Xiaohongshu, including the customer's phone number, recipient name, and address. Then, manually input this information into the supplier's order form. After confirming the product and price, place the order and submit it for shipping. This process ensures that your Xiaohongshu orders are fulfilled efficiently and accurately."

Manually input this data into the supplier's order form and complete the purchase. This mobile-based approach is particularly useful for on-the-go entrepreneurs who need to manage their business remotely."

One key technique is using 'no-trace' shipping methods available on platforms like Pinduoduo and Douyin. These methods ensure that the supplier's information is not visible to your customers, maintaining your role as the intermediary. Additionally, using software tools for order management on desktop computers can further enhance efficiency. These tools can automate parts of the order fulfillment process, reducing manual input and minimizing errors. By combining mobile and desktop strategies, you can create a robust system for managing orders and ensuring timely delivery to your customers."

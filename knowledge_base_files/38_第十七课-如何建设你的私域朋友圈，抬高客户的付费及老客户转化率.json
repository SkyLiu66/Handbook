        "Content": "First impressions play a crucial role in building trust with potential customers. When someone adds you on a platform like WeChat, their initial perception is formed by your profile picture, nickname, and personal signature. This initial impression is further reinforced by the content they see in your historical posts. It's important to ensure that your profile and posts reflect a positive and professional image. For instance, if you are a real estate agent, your posts should include your work achievements, family moments, and personal photos that convey trustworthiness and reliability. Avoid having a profile that contradicts your professional image, as this can create a negative impression. The key is to create a consistent and positive image that aligns with the expectations of your potential customers."

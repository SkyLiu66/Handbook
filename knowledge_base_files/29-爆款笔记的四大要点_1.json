        "Content": "To create a viral post, it is crucial to understand the platform's rules and how it determines the popularity of a post. Platforms like Xiaohongshu use specific criteria to judge whether a post is well-received by the audience. These criteria help the platform decide which posts to push into larger traffic pools, thereby increasing their exposure. When creating content, focus on four key aspects: engagement, follower growth, click-through rate, and retention rate. By aligning your content with these aspects, you increase the chances of your post becoming viral. Regularly check your post analytics by navigating to the 'Creation Center' on Xiaohongshu and selecting 'Note Analysis' to understand how your posts are performing. Use this data to make necessary adjustments and improve your content strategy."

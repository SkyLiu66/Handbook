    "data": " Humor in anything you do is good, for me, anyway. I know there are many writers who write without humor. For me, humor, whether it's broad or whether it's subtle, is always vital. Um, sometimes it can be very dry. Sometimes it can be overt. Whatever you're writing, you want some humor because humor is recognition. Humor is that moment where you see something that you've always thought, but now somebody has articulated it. And they've articulated in a way that you've never seen before. And sometimes it's just the joy of the unexpected. This is a book that is all humor. It's called Fortunately the Milk. It's a children's book. And it is about a father who sets off to buy milk for his children's breakfast. And... uh... finds himself kidnapped by aliens. And fleeing the aliens, finds himself captured by pirates. Who be ye, landlubber? Said the woman, who had a big hat on her head and a parrot on her shoulder. He's a spy, a walrus in a coat, a new kind of mermaid with legs, said the men. What are you doing here? Asked the woman. Well, I said, I just set out to the corner shop for some milk for my children's breakfast. And for my tea. And the next thing I knew, he's lying, your majesty. She pulled out her cutlass. You dare lie to the queen of the pirates? Fortunately, I had kept tight hold of the milk. And now I pointed to it. If I did not go to the corner shop to fetch the milk, I asked them, then where did this milk come from? At this, the pirates were completely speechless. Now I said, if you could let me off somewhere near to my destination, I would be much obliged to you. And where would that happen to be? Said the queen of the pirates. On the corner of Marshall Road and Fletcher Lane, I said, my children are waiting there for their breakfast. You're on a pirate ship now, me fine bucko, said the pirate queen. And you don't get dropped off anywhere. There are only two choices. You can join my pirate crew or refuse to join, and we will slit your cowardly throat. And you'll go to the bottom of the sea where you will feed the fishes. What about walking the plank? I asked. Never heard of it, said the pirates. Walking the plank, I said, it's what proper pirates do. Look, I'll show you. Do you have a plank anywhere? It took some looking, but we found a plank and I showed the pirates where to put it. We discussed nailing it down, but the pirate queen decided it was safer just to have the two fattest pirates sit on the end of it. Why exactly do you want to walk the plank? Asked the pirate queen. I edged out onto the plank. The blue Caribbean water splashed gently beneath me. Well, I said, I've seen lots of stories with pirates in them, and it seems to me that if I'm going to be rescued… At this, the pirates started to laugh so hard their stomachs wobbled, and the parrots took off into the air in amazement. Rescue? They said. There's no rescue out here. We're in the middle of the sea. Nevertheless, I told them, if you are going to be rescued, it will always be while walking the plank. Which we don't do, said the pirate queen. Here, have a Spanish doubloon and come and join us in our piratical adventures. It's the 18th century. She added. And there's always room for a bright, enthusiastic pirate. I caught the doubloon. I almost wished that I could, I told her, but I have children and they need their breakfast. Then you must die. Walk the plank. I edged out to the end of the plank. Sharks were circling. So were piranhas. Fortunately, the milk is a bit odd because it has a father narrating, but the actual book is narrated by his son. So. And this was where I interrupted my dad for the first time. Hang on. I said, piranhas are a freshwater fish. What were they doing in the sea? You're right, said my father. The piranhas were later. Right. So. I was out at the end of the plank facing certain death when a rope ladder hit my shoulder and a deep booming voice shouted, quickly climb up the rope ladder. I needed no more encouragement than this. And I grabbed the rope ladder with both hands. Fortunately, the milk was pushed deep into the pocket of my coat. The pirates hurled insults at me and even discharged pistols, but neither insults nor pistol shot found their targets. I soon made it to the top of the rope ladder. I'd never been in the basket of a hot air balloon before. It was very peaceful up there. The person in the balloon basket said, I hope you don't mind me helping, but it looked like you were having problems down there. I said, you're a stegosaurus. One of the fun things about a scene like that is you are taking a scene that everybody is kind of familiar with. And then. And then. And then you're just twisting it 45 degrees off kilter. So we have a pirate ship. And you get to go, what are the cliches? How can I make fun of the cliches? How can I enjoy the cliches? I love the idea that the first thing that anybody does if they're about to be killed on a pirate ship is demand the plank because of course you get rescued walking the plank. We've all seen that. So. But the thing that's really fun is just take a cliche. Take a scene that you have seen a thousand times and it can be from whatever kind of fiction you like. It can be, you know, if you like people with guns, it can be two people facing off with guns. If you like fiction with swords, it can be swords. If you like fiction with dragons, it can be somebody against you. Yeah. It can be a monster against a dragon. If you like doctor nurse romances, it can be a doctor and a nurse and another nurse. And they're glaring at each other because one thinks that the other one has slept with the other one. The other one knows that they haven't and they're a mess. You do the thing the cliched way. Do the way that you have seen it a hundred times. And now if you're going to mine it for humor, you just turn it and you tilt it. And some of that is just going to be word choice. Some of that is going to be attitude. And a lot of it is going to be surprise. Because the lovely thing about laughter is it's the release of tension. You are building up to something funny and then you're letting it go. You're building up to something tense and then you're deflating it with laughter. So see how you can do that. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. And then it's being familiar and something very cliched. And then have one of the characters just be a little bit more matter of fact than they ought to be. Have one of the characters know a little bit more about this kind of fiction than they ought to. Have one of the characters be much more concerned about whether they left the kettle on at home or that the kids need to be picked up from school than they are about the dragon or the gun. And just see what happens. Yeah, sure. Um, that way, it's an easy way to start building humor, but a really lovely way just to go in and find what's funny in a scene. Certain words are going to have humor. In the sequence that I read from Neverwhere, describing Ryslip as being heavier than four fops, each of those fops carrying a large suitcase filled entirely with lard. The use and deployment of the word lard is just, it's just the right word to deploy in the right way. And it gives you this wonderfully funny image in your head of four tall, thin people. Each. Hauling a suitcase around, which by its very nature is funny. So you can go, you know, use funny words, deploy them, play around. One of the things that stand-up comedians and people who write humor find fascinating is where in the sentence your word comes can actually mean the difference between funny or not funny. Ending. With the funny is always important. You know, four lard-filled suitcases as opposed to four suitcases filled entirely with lard. The lard being the funny word comes at the end. Ending. When Terry Pratchett and I were working on Good Omens, Um. we needed shorthand ways to communicate with each other. And what I loved about talking with Terry was that he would come up with terms for things that there were not terms for in ways to write comedy. One of those was a figgin. A figgin was a term that he had, started using in Discworld, where a figgin, uh, initially, uh, you think it's something terrible that, you know, like a body part, possibly a testicle or something where your figgins are going to be, you know, cut off or thrown to the winds. And later you discover a figgin is a small raisin filled, um, like an Eccles cake. It's a, it's a little sort of, um, pastry. And, he used to use that as just a, a figgin being a little joke that becomes a running joke. Um, but a running joke that then will pay off in some way toward the end. And they were distinguished from something that we built in, um, in Good Omens, which Terry called Sherbert Lemons. And he called them Sherbert Lemons because there is a moment in the TV series called, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, so this begins, um, the next thing that happens is a nuclear power station discovers their reactor has gone missing, but mysteriously is still putting out, uh, their nuclear power produits, with other teachers and stuff, they're still putting out a full load of power, they just don't know where they're getting it from. And when they go and inspect the enormous room where the reactor used to be, the only thing they find is a sherbet lemon. And so Terry would start using sherbet lemons to mean just little things that you'd throw in to the text to make someone smile. They'd just be a little nice little moment of humor. It's a small thing that you throw in, as opposed to a figgin'. And the figgin' would be something that you would think was just a sherbet lemon, but then it would pay off. And it would have a shape and a payoff toward the end, and it would appear, you'd sneak it in under the radar, people would think, ah, this is just a sherbet lemon, but actually it'll be a thing. Terry loved having these terms for things. Another one of Terry's terms was cigarettes. And he would talk about the end of a book as being built of cigarettes. And by cigarettes, what he meant was the moments in a 1960s cop show, 1960s American cop shows in particular, where everyone will be sitting around having a cigarette because they used to smoke on television in those days. And... they'd say, so what really happened to the widow Blumenthal anyway? And someone would say, ah, well, this would happen. And then you'd cut in on all of the characters. They'd all be having their little cigarettes, and you'd get a way of saying goodbye to them. So Terry would always love the idea that at the end of the novel, after a novel was done, you needed to have your cigarettes. You needed to just stop in on each character, explain anything from the plot that had not been explained so far, and wrap everything up. And say your goodbyes. And the problem with that, actually, I discovered years later, was the nice thing about the cigarettes on a 1970s American cop show is they are literally the time between the end of the episode and the final commercial break. So you have your commercials, and then you have your titles, and in between, they liked to have this little bit that they would squeeze in where nothing really would happen, and it lasted maybe a maximum of three minutes long. It was this tiny little thing. And of course, once you put them into a book, and then try and turn that book into television, your last half hour consists of people saying goodbye to each other after the plot is finished. So when I was doing Good Omens as a television series, I actually wound up having to reconfigure the entire plot for the last episode. And I was like, oh, I'm going to have to do this. And come up, while keeping the original plot that Terry and I came up with, I came up with a new plot. And one that keeps ticking until the final second, because I really didn't want a plot that finished halfway through, and then people just said goodbye to each other. Well, something that is definitely just a sherbet lemon is the fact that it's a good thing. In that it is there, it is a running gag. It shows up several times, but it's just there to be fun. It doesn't have any kind of payoff. Would be, this is an ANSI voice. And was the lime. And the idea being that Fat Charlie, who is the hero, is the hero of the novel, has arrived on a little island called St. Andrews. Here we go. He's taking a taxi ride. He learned there was no reason ever to leave St. Andrews. The taxi driver himself had seen no reason ever to leave St. Andrews, and he had given it much thought. The island had a cave and a mountain and a rainforest. Hotels, it had 20. Restaurants, several dozen. It contained a city, three towns, and a scattering of villages. Food, everything grew here. Oranges, bananas, nutmegs. It even, the taxi driver said, had limes. Fat Charlie said no at this, mostly in order to feel like he was taking part in the conversation. But the driver appeared to take it as a challenge to his honesty. He slammed on the taxi's brakes, sending the car slewing over to the side of the road, got out of the car, reached over a fence, pulled something from a tree, and walked back to the car. Look at this, he said. Nobody ever tell you that I is a liar. What it is? A lime, said Fat Charlie. Exactly. Which means that by the time we get to page 12, chapter 12, several chapters later, Fat Charlie gets to rent a bicycle. And there were information conduits on St. Andrews that Fat Charlie, who on some level, believed that coconut palms and cellular telephones ought to be mutually exclusive, had not expected. It did not seem to make any difference who he talked to. Old men playing draughts in the shade, women with breasts like watermelons and buttocks like armchairs and laughter like mockingbirds, a sensible young lady in the tourist office, a bearded rasta with a green, red, and yellow knit cap, and what appeared to be a woolen miniskirt, they all had the same response. You're the one with the lime. I suppose so. Show us your lime. It's back at the hotel. Look, I'm trying to find Callie Ann Higgler. She's about 60, American. Big mug of coffee in her hand. Never heard of her. And once Fat Charlie gets back to his room, Benjamin the concierge examined the bike and told Fat Charlie not to worry. They'd have it all fixed and good as new by tomorrow. Fat Charlie went back to his hotel room, the color of underwater, where his lime sat. He was a little bit like a little green Buddha on the countertop. You're no help, he told the lime. This was unfair. It was only a lime. There was nothing special about it at all. It was doing the best it could.",

        "Content": "To find benchmark accounts, you can use several methods across different platforms like Xiaohongshu and Douyin. On Xiaohongshu, start by using the search function to look for specific keywords related to your niche. Focus on accounts with fewer than 10,000 followers, as they are likely in a growth phase and easier to emulate. Look for accounts that use mixed content and avoid those with high-quality, original videos, as these are harder to replicate. On Douyin, use the search bar to find relevant videos and filter by those with high engagement but fewer than 300,000 followers. This ensures you are looking at accounts that are successful but not out of reach. By systematically searching and analyzing these accounts, you can find suitable benchmarks to follow."

        "Content": "Utilizing benchmark accounts for content creation can significantly enhance your efficiency and effectiveness. Once you identify suitable benchmark accounts, you can repurpose their content for your platform. For example, if you find a successful Douyin account, you can use their videos on Xiaohongshu by making slight edits to avoid plagiarism. This saves you the time and effort required to create original content. Additionally, observing how these accounts engage their audience can provide you with strategies for your content. Look at their posting frequency, the type of content they share, and how they interact with their followers. By adopting these practices, you can create engaging content that resonates with your audience, thereby increasing your chances of success."

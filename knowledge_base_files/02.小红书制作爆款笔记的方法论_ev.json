Look for patterns in high-performing posts, such as common themes, formats, and engagement tactics. For instance, if you notice that posts with detailed contract images and specific keywords like 'long-term lease contract' receive high engagement, consider incorporating similar elements into your content. This involves not only mimicking the format but also understanding the underlying reasons for their success, such as clarity, relevance, and audience interest. By systematically studying and replicating these successful strategies, you can enhance your content's performance and engagement."

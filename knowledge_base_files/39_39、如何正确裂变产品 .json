        "Content": "When a product goes viral, it's crucial to scale it effectively to maintain momentum without overwhelming the platform. Instead of repeatedly posting about the same product, diversify your content. If a post is still gaining traction, avoid duplicating it immediately. Instead, post about other products to keep your content varied. If you notice a decline in engagement after a few days, you can then repost about the viral product to boost its visibility again. This approach helps in maintaining a balanced content strategy and reduces the risk of being flagged by the platform for repetitive content. Additionally, avoid posting exclusively about the viral product; mix in new products and original content to keep your audience engaged and your account in good standing."

        "Content": "Balancing original and reposted content is essential for long-term success on Xiaohongshu. While reposting can help maintain engagement, it's important to start creating original content as soon as possible. Purchase samples of the viral product and create your own content based on successful formats. This not only helps in maintaining the quality of your posts but also reduces the risk of being flagged for duplicate content. Original content can be posted more frequently without restrictions, allowing you to maintain a steady flow of posts. By combining reposted content with original creations, you can keep your audience engaged and ensure the longevity of your account."

Initially, reposting content can help you gain traction, but it's important to gradually shift towards creating your own unique content. This involves purchasing samples of successful products and creating content that mimics the style and format of popular posts. Over time, develop your own templates and styles to establish a unique brand identity. This transition not only helps in maintaining the quality of your posts but also ensures compliance with platform guidelines. By focusing on original content, you can build a sustainable presence on Xiaohongshu and avoid the pitfalls of relying solely on reposted material."

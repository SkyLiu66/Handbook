        "Content": "To successfully sell products without creating videos, editing, writing copy, or live streaming, you can collaborate with precise influencers. Start by logging into Xiaohongshu and selecting the e-commerce section. After enabling the distribution capability, navigate to the Influencer Plaza to find influencers that match your product category. For instance, if you sell beauty products, filter influencers by the beauty category. Before initiating a collaboration, analyze the influencer's audience demographics to ensure they align with your target market. For example, if you sell baby products, an influencer with an audience aged 18-24 may not be ideal. Additionally, evaluate the influencer's live streaming capabilities by reviewing their average live stream data and sales performance. Look for influencers who have consistent live streaming schedules, high viewer engagement, and substantial sales figures. Once you find a suitable influencer whose audience and performance metrics align with your product, you can send a collaboration invitation."

        "Content": "When selecting influencers for product promotion, it's crucial to assess their live streaming capabilities. The number of followers alone does not determine an influencer's effectiveness in driving sales. Instead, analyze their live streaming data, including the frequency and duration of their streams, as well as their sales performance. For example, an influencer who streams regularly for an average of three hours and generates significant sales (e.g., $20,000 to $50,000) is likely to be a good candidate. Conversely, if an influencer streams infrequently, for less than two hours, and has low sales figures, they may not be worth collaborating with. Additionally, consider the alignment of their previous collaborations with your product category. An influencer who has successfully promoted similar products and has an audience that matches your target demographic is more likely to drive effective results. By thoroughly evaluating these factors, you can identify influencers with strong live streaming capabilities and a high potential for successful product promotion."

            "Requirements"
        ],
        "Content": "To enable the distribution capability on Xiaohongshu and collaborate with influencers for product promotion, you need to meet three specific requirements. First, your account must be a verified business account, which involves an annual fee of $600 for certification. Second, your store must have at least three listed products. Third, your store's operational status must be normal, without any violations or issues. If you meet these criteria, you can activate the distribution capability and start collaborating with influencers. However, if you do not currently meet these requirements, you can still reach out to influencers directly through their profile contact information, such as their collaboration email. Avoid sending private messages asking for collaboration or sharing your contact details, as this can lead to your messaging function being disabled or even account suspension. By adhering to these guidelines, you can effectively leverage influencers to promote your products on Xiaohongshu."

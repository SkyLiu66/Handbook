        "Content": "When reposting content on Xiaohongshu, it is crucial to adhere to specific content requirements to avoid being flagged for duplication. There are two main types of content: text and images, and videos. For text and images, you should convert them into a video format before reposting. Directly reposting text and images can lead to your post being taken down. For videos, you need to edit them to remove any identifiable elements before reposting. This can be done using video editing software to mix and match different clips. Additionally, you can convert videos into text and images if needed. The key is to ensure that the content is not directly copied from another Xiaohongshu post, as this increases the likelihood of being detected and penalized."

        "Content": "Selecting high-engagement posts is essential for successful reposting on Xiaohongshu. Focus on posts that have received significant engagement within the last seven days. This is because Xiaohongshu's algorithm favors recent and popular content. When choosing posts, consider the relative engagement rate. For accounts with a large following, high engagement is expected. However, for smaller accounts, a post with unexpectedly high engagement indicates that the content itself is compelling. Look for posts that have a sudden spike in likes and comments compared to the account's usual activity. These posts are likely to perform well when reposted. By selecting high-engagement posts, you increase the chances of your reposted content gaining visibility and attracting more followers."

        "Content": "To ensure the effectiveness of your account's ad campaigns, it is crucial to check whether your ad plans have been approved. Start by reviewing the test materials and identifying any posts that have been rejected. Examine the creative content to understand the reasons for rejection. Common reasons for rejection include the use of absolute terms, religious content, large tattoos, or nudity. Additionally, using unapproved edited content from other creators can also lead to rejection. To address these issues, modify the rejected posts to comply with platform guidelines. For instance, avoid using absolute terms and ensure that the content does not violate any community standards. If you are using mixed content, ensure that the editing is compliant with the platform's requirements. Xiaohongshu, for example, has strict guidelines for mixed content. If your editing skills are not up to par, consider taking courses to improve them. By ensuring that all your ad materials meet the platform's standards, you can avoid rejections and maintain the effectiveness of your ad campaigns."

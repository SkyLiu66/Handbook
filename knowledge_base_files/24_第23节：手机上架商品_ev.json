            "Content": "To upload products on Xiaohongshu using your mobile, first download the Xiaohongshu Merchant Edition app. This app serves as the management backend for merchants. If you are just starting and have a limited number of products, using your mobile for uploads is convenient. For bulk uploads, a computer is more efficient. Begin by sourcing products from platforms like Pinduoduo. For example, if you are selling phone cases, search for a suitable product on Pinduoduo, ensuring the store has good reviews and competitive prices. Once you have selected a product, download the images and copy the product title. Open the Xiaohongshu Merchant Edition app, navigate to 'Publish Product,' and fill in the required fields. Customize the product title slightly to avoid exact duplication. Upload the main images and, if available, a product video. Select the appropriate category, such as '3C Digital' for phone cases. Set the price by doubling the cost and adding a small margin. Ensure the inventory is set to a reasonable number, like 999. Fill in product attributes and details, then set the logistics type and shipping template. Choose a 48-hour shipping time to accommodate order processing. Finally, submit the product for review. Once approved, the product will be available in your store."

        "Content": "To register a Xiaohongshu account, start by opening the app and choosing a registration method: phone number, WeChat, Weibo, or QQ. Using a phone number is recommended as it will be required eventually. After registration, select your gender and age, preferably as an adult. Choose at least four content interests related to your intended content direction to help find similar accounts later. Upload a profile picture, preferably a clear, sunny, front-facing photo of yourself. For professionals like lawyers or doctors, use a professional photo to build trust. Avoid using landscape, object, or irrelevant photos. Fill in your nickname, keeping it simple and memorable, with no more than six characters and avoiding obscure characters or complex symbols. This completes the initial registration."

        "Content": "Optimizing your profile information is crucial for building a strong presence on Xiaohongshu. Start with a clear and professional profile picture. For the account name, use a formula that combines your content field with a simple, memorable name, such as 'Dad Reviews' or 'Makeup Artist Ann.' For personal branding, use a memorable personal name or nickname, like 'Cheng Shi'an' or 'Wang Paofu.' Ensure the name is easy to remember and does not exceed six characters. In your personal bio, include your credentials, core values, and what users can gain from following you. Mention any notable qualifications, awards, or affiliations. Outline the type of content you will share and your posting frequency. Initially, avoid sharing contact information to comply with Xiaohongshu's strict review policies. Once you have a substantial following, you can include contact details using symbols or homophones to avoid detection."

        "Content": "Managing multiple Xiaohongshu accounts is possible, but only one account can be verified with real-name authentication. If you have an old account without violations, you can continue using it. If it has violations, it's best to create a new one. Maintain one device, one account, and one IP to avoid being flagged as a marketing account. Profile updates, such as changing your avatar, name, or bio, require phone number binding or real-name authentication. Note that the Xiaohongshu ID can only be changed once, so consider using your WeChat ID for easier future interactions. Names can be updated every seven days, and bios can be updated three times every seven days. Following these guidelines helps ensure smooth account management and compliance with Xiaohongshu's policies."

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu offers several monetization opportunities for content creators and businesses. The first method is through the Pugongying platform, where users can earn by promoting products. The entry requirement has been lowered from 5,000 to 1,000 followers, making it accessible for new influencers. The second method involves live streaming, which has been boosted by the participation of celebrities like Dong Jie and Zhang Jincheng. This has attracted high-end products and users who prefer a calm and quiet shopping environment. The third method is opening a personal store, which is possible even with zero followers. Once a user reaches 1,000 followers, they can access the product selection center to start selling. These monetization strategies are supported by Xiaohongshu's user-friendly policies and high-quality user base, making it an ideal platform for both new and experienced content creators to generate income."

Focus on recent viral posts with high engagement. If no suitable content is found, expand the search to the past 30 days. Another method is to search directly on Xiaohongshu using relevant keywords and check the recommendation page. Additionally, platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou can be valuable sources for viral content. When using these platforms, ensure the videos do not have watermarks, as this can affect the quality and originality of your content. Once you find a suitable video, analyze its elements such as filters, text overlays, and titles. This analysis will help you understand what makes the video popular and how you can recreate or adapt it for your own content. By systematically searching and analyzing viral content, you can gather valuable material for your video creation process."

        "Content": "Repurposing and editing viral videos involves several steps to ensure originality and engagement. Start by downloading the selected video and removing any existing watermarks using tools like Douyin's watermark removal app. Next, use editing software such as Jianying to make necessary adjustments. Begin by cropping the video to remove unwanted parts and adjust the canvas size to fit the platform's requirements, such as a 9:16 ratio for Douyin. Add a background, either blurred or colored, to enhance the visual appeal. To avoid content duplication, change the video's speed and add background music. You can also separate the audio and replace it with a different voice or sound effect. Adding filters and overlays can further differentiate your video. For instance, use cold-tone filters or text overlays to match the video's theme. Incorporate 'picture-in-picture' effects by adding another video layer, which can be a static image or another video clip. These steps help in creating a unique version of the viral video, making it suitable for reposting without issues of plagiarism."

Start by selecting the most engaging frame as the video cover. The title should be compelling and include keywords that are trending or relevant to the content. For example, if the video is about a character reveal in a popular drama, use phrases like 'Character's True Identity Revealed' to attract viewers. Tags are crucial for discoverability; use relevant and high-traffic tags related to the video content. Check similar posts to see which tags are effective. When writing the description, include a call-to-action to encourage interaction, such as 'Follow for more updates' or 'Comment your thoughts below.' This increases engagement and helps the video reach a wider audience. Avoid scheduling posts or saving them as drafts; instead, publish them immediately to maintain relevance. Consistency in posting format, whether video or text, also helps in building a recognizable and reliable account. By following these steps, you can effectively publish and optimize your videos on Xiaohongshu, ensuring maximum reach and engagement."

            "Content": "To set a reasonable price for your products, it's crucial to understand the various cost components involved. These include platform commission, payment channel fees, and shipping insurance. For instance, if your monthly sales exceed 10,000 units, a 5% platform commission will be applied. Payment channel fees are generally 0.7% per order, and shipping insurance costs vary by category. By knowing these costs, you can accurately calculate your profit margins and avoid losses."

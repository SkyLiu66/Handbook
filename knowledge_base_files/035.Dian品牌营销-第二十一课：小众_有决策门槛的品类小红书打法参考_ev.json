The brand in the text uses Xiaohongshu to post content that generates interest and drives traffic to their live streams. They understand that not all users will make an immediate purchase after seeing a post, so they use live streaming as a follow-up to convert these interested users into buyers. This dual approach allows them to capture a broader audience and guide them through the sales funnel more effectively. By using multiple accounts for live streaming, they can reach more viewers and create a sense of urgency and exclusivity. Additionally, collaborating with influencers who have a genuine connection with the product helps in creating authentic content that resonates with the audience. This strategy not only boosts sales but also builds a loyal customer base."

By focusing on influencers who genuinely connect with their product, the brand ensures that their marketing efforts are authentic and effective. This approach is particularly useful for niche products that require a higher level of consumer education and trust before purchase."

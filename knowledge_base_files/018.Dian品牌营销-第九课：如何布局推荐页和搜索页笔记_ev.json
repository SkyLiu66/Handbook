Engagement can be fostered through various actions such as likes, subscriptions, shares, and donations. These interactions not only boost the visibility of the content but also create a sense of community and support among the audience. To encourage engagement, creators should consistently remind their audience to like, subscribe, share, and support their content. This can be done through call-to-action prompts within the content itself. Additionally, engaging with the audience by responding to comments and acknowledging their support can further enhance the sense of community. By fostering a supportive and interactive environment, content creators can build a loyal and engaged audience base."

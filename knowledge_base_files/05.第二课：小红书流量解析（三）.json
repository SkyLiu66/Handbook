        "Content": "Xiaohongshu's traffic tiers help users understand the performance of their accounts and content. Generally, a non-violating account can expect around 100 views per post. If your posts consistently receive only single or low double-digit views, it indicates a potential issue with your account. It's important to note that there can be a delay in traffic distribution, often taking 24 to 48 hours for the platform to push your content. For accounts with some established weight, typical views range from 200 to 500. Accounts with a strong persona can achieve several thousand views per post. If your content includes product links (Xiaohongshu's 'little yellow car'), additional metrics like click-through and conversion rates are also considered. Understanding these tiers allows you to self-assess your account's health and make necessary adjustments to improve performance."

        "Content": "Boosting content visibility on Xiaohongshu involves several strategies. First, ensure your account is in good standing without any violations. Regularly posting high-quality content can help maintain and increase your account's weight. If your posts are stuck at a certain view count, consider using Xiaohongshu's paid promotion tool, 'Shutiao.' For instance, if a post reaches around 5,000 views but doesn't progress further, investing a small amount in promotion can help push it to the next tier. Additionally, focus on creating engaging content that encourages interactions such as likes, comments, and shares. For posts with product links, ensure the product is relevant and appealing to your audience to maintain high click-through and conversion rates. By strategically using these methods, you can enhance your content's reach and engagement."

        "Content": "Maintaining content consistency and proper tagging is crucial for sustained growth on Xiaohongshu. Consistent posting helps build your account's credibility and keeps your audience engaged. It's important to stick to a niche or theme that aligns with your audience's interests. Changing your content focus or tags can lead to a drop in views as the platform's algorithm may need time to re-evaluate your account. For example, if you switch from posting about e-commerce to lifestyle content, your established audience may not engage as much, leading to lower initial views. Proper tagging also plays a significant role in content discovery. Use relevant and specific tags to increase the chances of your content being found by users interested in those topics. By maintaining consistency and using appropriate tags, you can ensure steady growth and better engagement on Xiaohongshu."

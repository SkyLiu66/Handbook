The advantages include working from home and having a global client base. However, marketing can be challenging, especially on social media. Focus on choosing the right platforms and creating content that attracts your ideal clients. Pinterest is excellent for driving traffic by linking pins to your website. Instagram is a prime tool for attracting a global audience with strategic content. Show your face and personality to help people relate to your brand. Educate potential clients about virtual design and use newsletters to nurture leads. Create lead magnets like design tips or checklists to grow your email list. Efficient content planning with tools like Planoly, Later, or Tailwind can help you stay organized and consistent."

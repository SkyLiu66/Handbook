        "Content": "Before setting up any details on a new Xiaohongshu account, it is crucial to activate the account by engaging with the platform. After registering a new account, refrain from changing any settings such as the nickname or profile details. Instead, spend at least one hour daily for a week to a month browsing the homepage, liking, and commenting on posts as a regular user would. This activity helps to 'warm up' the account, making it appear more genuine and active. Using a new phone number to register is recommended to avoid any issues related to old accounts. This activation period is essential for ensuring that the account is ready for more significant activities like posting notes and engaging with followers. By following this process, you can ensure that your account is well-prepared and has a better chance of gaining traction on Xiaohongshu."

        "Content": "When setting up your Xiaohongshu profile, it is important to align your profile details with your intended content and audience. Your profile picture, nickname, and bio should reflect a positive and upward-looking image. For example, if you are creating a growth-oriented account, consider using nicknames like 'Growth Diary' or 'On the Path to Success.' Avoid overly common names to stand out. Your profile picture should be clear and optimistic, whether it is a personal photo or an avatar. The bio should be concise and reflect your account's purpose, such as 'Documenting my journey to success' or 'Sharing tips for personal growth.' Additionally, complete other profile details like location, age, and interests as accurately as possible to build a trustworthy and relatable profile. This careful setup helps attract the right audience and establishes a strong foundation for your account."

        "Content": "Maintaining privacy on Xiaohongshu is important if you do not want your friends or family to know about your account. If you registered with your phone number, others might find you through it. To prevent this, go to the privacy settings and disable options like 'Recommend me to people who may know me' and 'Show me in others' contact lists.' If you used a new phone number, this issue is less likely to occur. Additionally, avoid linking your new account with your existing one to prevent cross-recommendations. You can also hide your followers and following lists for added privacy. These settings help ensure that your activities on Xiaohongshu remain private and are not easily discovered by people you know. By taking these steps, you can comfortably engage with the platform without worrying about unwanted attention from your personal network."

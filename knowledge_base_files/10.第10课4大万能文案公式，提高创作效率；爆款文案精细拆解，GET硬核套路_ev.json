        "Content": "Copywriting can be categorized into four types: informative, storytelling, empathetic, and review-based. Informative copywriting includes skill-based and educational content, where you share knowledge that others might not know. Storytelling involves creating scenarios, vlogs, or role-playing to convey a message. Empathetic copywriting connects with the audience's emotions, often by addressing common experiences or challenges. Review-based copywriting involves evaluating and providing feedback on products or services. Each type has its own structure and approach, but all aim to engage the audience and convey valuable information effectively."

        "Content": "Informative copywriting should follow a structured approach to ensure clarity and engagement. Start by emphasizing the importance of the skill or knowledge you are sharing. This can be done by highlighting the benefits or the unique value it offers. Next, address the 'two whys': why you are qualified to speak on the topic and why the audience should listen. This builds credibility and relevance. Use a pyramid structure for the content, starting with a general overview, followed by detailed points, and concluding with a summary. Incorporate examples and practical tips to make the information actionable. Finally, encourage interaction by asking questions or prompting the audience to share their thoughts."

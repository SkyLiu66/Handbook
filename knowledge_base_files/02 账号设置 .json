Finding the right content involves identifying successful accounts and sourcing material. Start by examining the names and signatures of popular accounts, such as 'Entrepreneurship Notes' or 'Project Circle.'

Follow 30 to 50 similar accounts with a secondary account to stay updated on their latest posts. This allows you to replicate successful content strategies.

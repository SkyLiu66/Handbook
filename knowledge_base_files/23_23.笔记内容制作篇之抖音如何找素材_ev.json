        "Content": "When creating content for Xiaohongshu, it's important to decide whether to focus on video or image posts. Videos generally have a higher chance of going viral compared to images because they can showcase more details and engage viewers more effectively. As a beginner, it's advisable to start with videos. Once you master video creation, you can easily transition to images if needed. Videos allow for a richer presentation of your products, making it easier to attract and retain viewers. However, if you find video creation challenging, you can start with images and gradually incorporate videos into your content strategy. The key is to consistently produce high-quality content that resonates with your audience."

        "Content": "For beginners, using mixed editing (combining various clips and materials) is a practical approach to content creation. Original content creation has a high entry barrier and requires significant effort and creativity. Mixed editing allows you to produce engaging content without the need for extensive filming and editing. Once you become proficient in mixed editing and can consistently generate engaging posts, you can gradually incorporate original content. This approach helps you build a foundation and understand what works best for your audience. Over time, as you gain confidence and skills, you can experiment with original content to add a unique touch to your posts."

You can source material from various platforms like Douyin (TikTok), Xiaohongshu, and other content libraries. When sourcing material, ensure that it is original and not already mixed or edited by others to avoid issues with platform policies. Use tools like Wallio Pro or Longmao Tools Master to download high-quality, watermark-free images and videos. These tools help you extract and save content material efficiently. Consistently sourcing and using high-quality material will enhance the overall quality of your posts, making them more appealing to your audience."

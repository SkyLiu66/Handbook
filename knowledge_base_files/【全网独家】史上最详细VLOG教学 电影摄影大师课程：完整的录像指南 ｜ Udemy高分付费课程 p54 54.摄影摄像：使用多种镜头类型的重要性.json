So let's start with knowing your different shot types. Now what I'm going to show you is an example of a scene with one shot type and we're going to see what that looks like. Now we're going to look at that same exact scene with multiple shot types. It's going to allow for us to have more depth in that same scene but also stretch time, have more footage to work with in post-production and to really create an actual experience that extends beyond just a five second clip. Let's check it out. It's pretty cool, right? So we're looking at close-ups, wide shots, medium shots, a lot of slow motion. So like we mentioned before, this is a perfect scenario to use slow motion capability on the camera that you're shooting on to tell a story. What we're doing here is really using our different ability to tell a story through shooting. So we're going to go ahead and start with that. So we're going to go ahead and start with that. So we're going to go ahead and start with that. We're going to start with that. So we're going to start with that. And you'll notice that we're choosing what ingredients to show to the audience. Just like a chef. A little bit of salt, a little bit of pepper, a little bit of cayenne adds some spice. This is really how we use different shot types and really how we decide, you know, how to effectively tell our story. And so what we're going to do now is go over what the title of these different shot types are. And then I'll briefly explain when to use which type of shot.",

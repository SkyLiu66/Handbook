You guys can click and check out all of the offerings that she has. And I wanted to just recap really quickly all of our before and after shots that we did in this session. So here is the before and after with our artificial lighting setup. You can see with and without the colored gels and with and without using a hair light and the two different options of having high key lighting and low key lighting. And here are the examples that we shot in natural light. Our before where we're not using the lighting properly in our surroundings, with and without practicals in the background and shooting at 28 millimeters and then we're shooting at 20 millimeters. And then we're shooting at 20 millimeters. Versus 70 millimeters with more distance between our camera and our subject. And so that about wraps it up for this portion of lighting, camera types, lens choice, focal length and focus in this part of the course. I will see you in the next lecture.",

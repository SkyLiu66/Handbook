        "Content": "When starting to edit videos for Xiaohongshu, it's essential to find reference accounts that have successfully created high-engagement content. Begin by searching for products similar to what you want to promote and identify accounts with high sales but relatively low follower counts. This indicates that their content is effective despite a smaller audience. Analyze their high-engagement videos to understand the structure and style. Use these videos as templates for your content. By mimicking successful formats, you can create videos that are more likely to attract attention and engagement. This method simplifies the content creation process and increases the chances of your videos performing well."

        "Content": "Gathering and organizing video materials is a crucial step in creating engaging content. Start by downloading high-quality videos and images related to your product from platforms like Xiaohongshu and Douyin. Ensure that the materials you collect are recent and have not been overused to avoid content redundancy and potential copyright issues. Aim to collect 5 to 10 different materials for each product to provide variety in your edits. Organize these materials in a way that makes them easily accessible during the editing process. This preparation allows for a smoother editing workflow and ensures that you have enough content to create multiple videos without repeating the same footage."

Use editing software to adjust the video ratio to Xiaohongshu's preferred 3:4 format. Ensure consistency in your video ratios to avoid disrupting the viewer's experience. Separate the audio from the video if you plan to use the original sound, and remove any unwanted background noise. Replace segments of the reference video with your collected materials, ensuring that the transitions are smooth and the content remains coherent. Pay attention to details such as removing watermarks and adjusting the video to highlight the product effectively. Consistent and professional editing enhances the overall quality of your videos, making them more appealing to both viewers and potential advertisers."

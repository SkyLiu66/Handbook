        "Content": "Creating effective covers and titles is crucial for gaining visibility on Xiaohongshu. For covers, it's important to regularly browse the homepage and observe what your competitors are doing. Look for popular posts and take inspiration from their covers, especially those with high engagement. If a cover has a significant number of likes within a short period, it indicates a potential viral post. Use similar styles and elements in your covers to attract attention. For titles, avoid high repetition as it can lead to reduced visibility. Instead, diversify your titles by using different keywords and phrases. Check the community's hot search terms and popular notes for inspiration. By continuously updating and testing your covers and titles, you can maintain high engagement and avoid being penalized for repetitive content."

        "Content": "Repetition in titles can significantly limit your reach on Xiaohongshu. When creating titles, ensure that they are not overly similar to each other. For example, if you have a title like 'Real Share: Baby Loves Bathing with Bath Sponge,' avoid simply changing one word to create another title like 'Real Share: Baby Loves Bathing with Foam Sponge.' Such minor changes can lead to high repetition rates, which the platform's algorithm may penalize. Instead, create varied titles that convey the same message differently. Use different keywords and phrases to describe your content. Regularly check the community's hot search terms and popular notes for new ideas. By diversifying your titles, you can maintain a higher reach and avoid being flagged for repetitive content."

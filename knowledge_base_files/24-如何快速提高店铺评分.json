            "Content": "Store ratings are crucial as they directly impact your product's conversion rate and eligibility for participating in official platform activities like Double Eleven, Double Twelve, and other seasonal events. Low ratings can prevent you from accessing these opportunities, which means missing out on significant traffic support from the platform. Therefore, maintaining a high store rating is essential. The six factors affecting store ratings are: negative review rate, product return rate, complaint rate, logistics speed, customer service response speed, and refund processing speed. Address each factor with specific strategies to improve your overall rating."

            "Content": "To reduce the negative review rate, consider adding small surprise gifts in your packages, such as belts for clothing, socks for shoes, or accessories for women's wear. Include a thank-you note to make customers feel valued, increasing the likelihood of positive reviews. If a customer leaves a negative review, contact them to apologize and offer a small compensation, such as a red envelope, to encourage them to delete the review. This proactive approach can significantly lower your negative review rate and improve overall customer satisfaction."

            "Content": "Ensure timely shipping to avoid delays. If a customer reports that their logistics information hasn't been updated for several days, contact the logistics company to expedite the process. For customer service, assign a dedicated person to handle inquiries and refunds promptly. Enable notification settings on the Xiaohongshu Merchant Edition app to stay alert to new messages. To boost customer service ratings, have friends or family simulate customer inquiries at different times and through various entry points, ensuring they engage in meaningful conversations before leaving positive feedback. This method helps improve your response rate and overall customer service score."

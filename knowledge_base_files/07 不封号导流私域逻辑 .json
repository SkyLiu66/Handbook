        "Content": "Driving traffic from Xiaohongshu to private domains can be done safely by using specific strategies that minimize the risk of account suspension. One effective method is to use fan groups, which are officially recognized by Xiaohongshu. By adding a group link to your posts, you can direct your followers to join these groups where further interactions and transactions can take place. It is important to use secondary accounts to post promotional content within these groups, rather than using your main account. This reduces the risk of your main account being flagged or suspended. Additionally, avoid setting these secondary accounts as group administrators to further distance them from your main account. Pinning your promotional messages within the group ensures that new members see them immediately. This method has been tested and has not resulted in any account suspensions, making it a reliable way to drive traffic to private domains."

To effectively use fan groups, start by creating a group and adding a link to it in your posts. This encourages your followers to join the group, where you can interact with them more directly. Within the group, use secondary accounts to post promotional content and avoid using your main account to reduce the risk of suspension. Ensure that these secondary accounts are not set as administrators to further minimize risk. Pin important messages, such as promotional offers or group rules, to the top of the group chat to ensure visibility. Additionally, use group-specific keywords or codes to streamline communication and transactions. This method not only helps in maintaining a safe and active group but also enhances the overall engagement and transaction rates. By leveraging fan groups, you can create a more personalized and interactive experience for your followers."

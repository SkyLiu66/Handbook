        "Content": "After purchasing the course, it is crucial to watch all the videos from start to finish, especially for those with no prior experience in e-commerce or content creation. The videos cover fundamental operations, such as editing videos, finding materials, and posting notes. Skipping these videos may result in misunderstandings during one-on-one guidance sessions. Therefore, it is advised to watch the videos attentively without taking notes, focusing instead on understanding the editing and posting processes. For those with prior experience, it is sufficient to watch the key sections related to editing and posting notes. The primary goal is to grasp the essential techniques to ensure effective learning and application."

This includes setting up your store according to the course instructions and ensuring all foundational elements are in place. After the store setup, the focus shifts to product selection, which is divided into two parts: self-selection and guided selection. If you are confident in selecting products, you can choose and then seek approval. If unsure, one-on-one guidance is available for product selection. Following product selection, the next steps involve sourcing materials, editing, and posting notes. It is emphasized not to focus on creating original content but rather on replicating successful notes to quickly gain traction. Regular communication and feedback with the instructor are crucial during this phase to ensure proper guidance and adjustments."

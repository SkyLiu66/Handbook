For instance, on Xiaohongshu's merchant version, you can find a section called 'Community Hot Search Terms' on the homepage. These terms are based on real-time user searches within Xiaohongshu. By creating posts using these hot search terms, you can receive additional traffic rewards. For example, if you see that 'hairpins' are trending, you can explore the high-exposure, high-click, and high-conversion content related to hairpins. Assess whether you can source similar products at competitive prices. Additionally, examine the types of content that are performing well, such as the style, cover, and price range of popular items. This approach helps you align your product offerings with current market demands and gain more visibility."

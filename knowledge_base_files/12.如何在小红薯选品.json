        "Content": "When selecting products to promote on Xiaohongshu, it's important to focus on three main criteria: ease of shooting, profitability, and sales volume. First, choose products that are easy to photograph and create content for. Complicated products that require extensive time and effort to shoot should be avoided. Second, ensure that the product has a profit margin of at least 30%, ideally 50% or more. This ensures that the effort put into promoting the product is financially worthwhile. Lastly, select products with a sales volume of at least 500 units. High sales volume indicates market demand and increases the likelihood of successful promotion. By adhering to these criteria, you can identify products that are not only easy to promote but also profitable and in demand."

Start by searching for keywords related to the product you want to promote. For example, if you are interested in promoting bags, search for 'bags' and analyze the top results. Look for notes with high engagement, such as likes and comments, as these indicate popular and well-received products. Additionally, check if there are competitors selling the same product and assess their performance. If competitors are not performing well, it may be due to poor note quality or lack of promotion. This presents an opportunity to create better content and capture the market. By leveraging notes and keywords, you can identify high-demand products with potential for successful promotion."

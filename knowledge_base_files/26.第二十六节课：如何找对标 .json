        "Content": "When identifying benchmark accounts, it is essential to follow specific criteria to ensure they are relevant and useful for comparison. First, the account should have fewer than 1,000 followers, as these accounts are typically newer and provide more relevant insights. Second, the account should primarily feature non-original content, indicating that it is repurposing content from other sources. Third, the associated store should have sales exceeding 1,000 units, demonstrating a successful sales strategy. Finally, the account's content should be highly focused on a specific niche, ensuring that the insights gained are applicable to your own content strategy. By adhering to these criteria, you can effectively identify benchmark accounts that provide valuable insights for improving your own content and marketing strategies."

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book) is a valuable platform for finding benchmark accounts. To start, open the app and use the search bar to look for relevant keywords, such as 'underwear.' Filter the results to focus on products and scroll through the accounts. Look for accounts with follower counts and sales figures that meet the established criteria. For example, an account with 256 followers and 983 sales is a good candidate. Check the account's content to ensure it features non-original material and has a consistent theme. Avoid accounts that are flagship stores or have too many followers, as they may not provide the most relevant insights. By systematically searching and evaluating accounts on Xiaohongshu, you can compile a list of benchmark accounts that will help you refine your content strategy."

        "Content": "Once you have identified potential benchmark accounts, the next step is to evaluate and follow them. Start by examining the account's content to ensure it meets the criteria of non-original material and niche focus. Look at the variety of backgrounds and themes in their posts to confirm they are repurposing content. If the account consistently uses similar cover images that drive sales, it is a good indicator of effective content strategy. Follow these accounts to keep track of their updates and gain insights into their successful practices. Aim to follow at least ten benchmark accounts to gather a diverse range of strategies and ideas. Regularly review their content and adapt their successful tactics to your own strategy, ensuring continuous improvement and relevance in your niche."

This could be the video format, the presentation style, or the time of posting. For example, you can test whether a vertical or horizontal video format performs better by keeping all other factors constant. Analyze the performance metrics such as views, likes, and comments to determine which version resonates more with your audience. By systematically testing and refining your content, you can identify what works best and optimize your strategy for maximum engagement."

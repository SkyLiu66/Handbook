        "Content": "To use popular audio clips for video editing, start by importing the video into an editing tool like Jianying. First, separate the audio from the video by selecting the video clip and choosing the 'Audio Separation' option. This allows you to use the audio independently of the original video. Next, mute the original video to focus solely on the audio. You can then replace the video segments while keeping the popular audio intact. For example, if the original video shows unboxing a product, you can replace it with your own footage of unboxing while retaining the audio. Ensure that your new video clips match the audio in terms of timing and context. This method helps in leveraging popular audio to enhance the appeal of your content while maintaining originality in the visuals."

        "Content": "When editing videos, it's crucial to adjust the orientation and background to fit the platform's requirements. For instance, if the original video is in landscape mode but the platform prefers portrait mode, you need to adjust accordingly. Use the editing tool to change the background ratio to match the desired orientation. For example, if the platform uses a 3:4 ratio, adjust your video background to this ratio. This ensures that the main content remains centered and visually appealing. Additionally, you can change the background color to match the overall theme of the video. This process helps in maintaining the visual integrity of the video while adhering to the platform's specifications. Proper orientation and background adjustments make your video more professional and engaging."

You can manually type the spoken words or use an automatic subtitle recognition feature. Ensure that the subtitles are synchronized with the audio for a seamless viewing experience. If the tool provides an option to apply subtitles to the entire video, use it to maintain consistency. Additionally, check for any errors or typos in the automatically generated subtitles and correct them. You can also customize the appearance of the subtitles by changing the font, color, and size to match the video's theme. Properly synchronized and visually appealing subtitles make your video more accessible and engaging, enhancing the overall viewer experience."

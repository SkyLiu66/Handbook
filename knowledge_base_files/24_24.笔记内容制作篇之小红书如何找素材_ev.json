        "Content": "Xiaohongshu is primarily focused on image-based content, making it an excellent platform for sourcing visual materials. To find relevant images, use the search function and upload saved images for recognition. This method allows you to find similar images and related content. Once you find suitable images, you can save them and use tools like Longmao to extract and download high-quality, watermark-free images. This process is particularly useful for finding product images and inspiration for your own content. Remember to avoid using personal or professionally shot images without permission. Instead, focus on images that are widely shared and not tied to individual creators."

            "Xiaohongshu",

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu and Douyin serve different purposes when it comes to content sourcing. Xiaohongshu is more focused on image and text-based content, while Douyin is primarily video-centric. When sourcing content from Xiaohongshu, look for image-based posts and text notes. For video content, Douyin is the better platform. The requirements for content on both platforms are similar: avoid using heavily edited or mixed content and focus on original materials. Additionally, when sourcing from Douyin, look for accounts with fewer than 10,000 followers to find low-follower but high-engagement content. This approach helps you find unique and effective materials for your own content creation."

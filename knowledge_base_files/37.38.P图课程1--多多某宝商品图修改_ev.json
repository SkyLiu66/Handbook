        "Content": "High-quality images are crucial for engaging your audience and ensuring your content stands out. While videos often perform better in terms of engagement, a well-crafted image can be just as effective if you don't have suitable video content. Avoid using low-quality images with excessive text or fake-looking content, as these are less likely to attract viewers. Instead, focus on creating visually appealing images with clear, high-resolution visuals. Use tools like filters and adjustments to enhance the image quality. For instance, you can use apps like 'Xingtu' to add filters, adjust sharpness, and crop images to a 3:4 ratio, which is particularly effective on platforms like Xiaohongshu. This ratio ensures that your images are more visually striking and likely to capture attention."

First, aim for a 3:4 aspect ratio, as this format is visually appealing and stands out in the feed. Avoid using images with watermarks or low resolution, as these can detract from the overall quality. Use editing tools to enhance the image by adding filters and adjusting sharpness. For example, the 'Xingtu' app allows you to fine-tune images by cropping, adding filters, and sharpening. This makes the images more attractive and professional. Additionally, avoid overcrowding the image with text or unnecessary elements. A clean, well-composed image is more likely to engage viewers and encourage interaction."

        "Content": "Using filters and stickers can significantly enhance the visual appeal of your images, but it's important to use them judiciously. Filters can improve the overall look of an image by adjusting colors, contrast, and brightness. However, it's crucial to choose filters that enhance the image without making it look artificial. Stickers can add a fun element to your images, but overusing them can make the image look cluttered and unprofessional. If you decide to use stickers, opt for small, subtle ones that complement the image rather than overpower it. For instance, adding a small sticker to highlight a specific feature can be effective. Always preview your image after adding filters and stickers to ensure it maintains a high-quality, professional appearance."

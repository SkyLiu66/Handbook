So one of the first questions you might have when shooting is whether you should use a zoom lens or prime lens. That's a great question because there are a few key benefits and drawbacks to each type of lens. If we start off here with the prime 50 millimeter 1.4 we can see is a very shallow depth of field. Our subject is razor-sharp and the background is very blurry. The downside to this is that there's no zoom function. You can't move from a 50 mil to 70 mil. You have to actually physically move your body and your camera closer and further to what you're shooting. Now the trade-off is that you're giving away that ability to get multiple shot types with one lens for the great looking camera. If you're shooting with a 50mm or a 70mm, you can actually move your camera closer and further to the background. The second thing you might want to do is to use a zoom lens. This is a really good option because it allows you to get a much larger maximum aperture. This allows you to get a much larger maximum aperture which lets more light into the lens and allows for you to shoot in different scenarios with much lower available light. Now when Luis switches over to his zoom lens, he's going to be able to shoot in a much larger aperture. So you can get a much larger maximum aperture. Now the second thing you might want to do is to use a zoom lens. Now we're shooting on a 24-105 at 4.0. So without having to move, we can get a wide shot, we can get a close-up, we can get a medium shot, all very quickly and easily. So we're getting multiple focal lengths and multiple different framings with one single lens. So with this 24mm at 4.0 and this 50mm at 1.4, you can see a huge difference. With the 50mm, we see the subject very sharp. We see a very cinematic looking image. We can see the subject very sharp. We see a very cinematic looking image. And on the 24mm, it feels much more of a behind-the-scenes kind of less produced, less professional shot because so much of the frame is in focus. But as I'm shooting the behind the scenes here, I can very quickly shoot a wide shot, zoom in and shoot a close-up of just the camera, and easily choose different types of framing. Now at this next setup, Luis is deciding to throw on the 17-40mm 4.0. So we're going to use the 70-40mm 4.0. So we're going to use the 70-40mm 4.0. So we're going to use the 70-40mm 4.0. And we're going to shoot a super wide-angle lens that he strategically chose for this very dramatic setting where we have the subject walking through this large doorway and we really get a feel for the scale and size of what's in our image. Compared to the 24-70mm that I'm shooting in on, it's not nearly as dramatic. And we're seeing a lot more of the majority of the image in focus. So we're clearly seeing the subject and where she is in the location. So the takeaway here is that as a video creator, you're using your tools to change the way that the viewer is feeling. And you don't need a whole lot of lenses. If you have maybe two lenses and even on smartphones and they now have a wide angle function and a telephoto function, you can mix and use all of these different techniques together to create something that feels more professional or adventurous or action-oriented. And that's where we're going to be focusing today. So I'm going to talk to you about some of the features that we're going to be focusing on today. And I'm going to talk to you about some of the features that we're going to be focusing on today. And I'm going to tell you the basics of these 3D images like a tiny window, a married woman that's not yet married, a family that only neededinfested of scarcity, or for the church that only needed to have a communion, or for the poor that need a�리 a couple ofseating from her to sleek by candlelight, the good thing about 3D images is that recordings of people these lights the look slightly different but it can also shed some of the day's spotlight pleasing image. This is a great guideline and a framework to follow as a video creator, but as we're going to learn in this course, we want to learn these rules so that we can use them properly, but then also be able to consciously break them for a desired effect.",

Hey Julian, thank you for having me, man. Of course. So kind of today we're going to be touching on, you know, the real life experience of a filmmaker. I really want Vlats to be able to share his story and offer advice, inspiration, motivation, and really just any other kind of information that he wants to share with you guys. After going through the course and getting all these techniques on upgrading your cinematography and creating better videos, I want to have someone else who's also been doing this as a freelancer and works full time as a filmmaker. So I want to have someone else who's also been doing this as a freelancer and works full time as a filmmaker to share his perspective. So Vlats, I just kind of want to start with, you know, maybe just a short little backstory on what got you to today. Sure. I'm from Colombia, so I was born in Bogota. And I remember the first time I started messing with video, it was doing stuff on Windows Movie Maker. Actually just for fun, grabbing like different footage and making those awful like textures. And I remember I was like, I'm going to start with the text on screen with the fonts that they have in Windows and just having fun with it, like getting creative. The same way like DJs started like making mixes and tapes from radio. That's kind of the approach, like the ghetto approach that I did, like just grabbing Windows Movie Maker. Then I remember I went to Miami to visit an aunt and she had like a video recorder, super old school. And I was, I just wanted to like put my hands on it. See how it works. I was always fascinated by it. And I remember I loved just to put it on, check like this little screen, the little red dot. It felt cool. I don't know. There's something about it that's always been present in like since I was a little kid. And then YouTube came. And in Colombia, like YouTube, like everything gets so late. So the huge YouTube. I mean, YouTube was, were not in Colombia, but like in different countries. And I always felt like I wanted to be on YouTube, but I didn't know how everything was in English. So there were no content creator creators teaching in Spanish. So that was a huge, huge difference in like being here in the States where you had like a lot of academies, a lot of content. Teachers. So I, I had like five YouTube channels. I bought a GoPro, like three or two. It was an old one. And I started messing with it. I downloaded it at Premiere, Premiere Pro, starting like getting to know the software. And I started doing moto vlogs in my motorcycle with a lavalier mic. It didn't work. So I had to like get my hands on it, and then I just started doing it. And I was like, okay. So I had to learn how to make the audio kind of better. And, and then I bought a Canon 6 CD, starting messing with it. It was so much fun taking everything that camera has to offer. And if you look at it right now, it's like so obsolete for video. It's like the quality is bad. The sound is awful, but it was the best camera that I could have afforded right there. And then that knowledge. Then coming back. Yeah. Yeah. And then here to Los Angeles, having the opportunity to take like knowledge from the YouTube teachers, but like in English, that's a complete different step because it's like people are doing it here and there's a lot of good teachers everywhere. So that's something I'm so grateful. And I met a really, really cool guy, Julian. You taught me so, so much. Not only like. About cameras, gear, editing, but like perspective of how to even deal with filmmaking situations. That's something you don't get to learn online. That's something you get like from a human to human and experience in doing it. And that's something that I still appreciate and it's with me and it's going to be with me forever. And it means a lot. Yeah. Thank you, man. Thank you for sharing that. And thank you for, yeah, of course those like kind words. So your back story, some of that stuff I didn't even really realize the difference between, yeah, sometimes where you're living creates certain scenario. So that's, yeah, I think a lot of the times we forget these things, especially the internet too. It is an interesting kind of tool that we can use, but I also wanted to kind of touch in on. So you moved to America. Now you're working with a pretty high end client full time, making good money, creating content on a monthly monthly basis. You're putting out how many videos a month for this client? It's crazy. It's from little videos for Instagram to serious podcast series, DJ routines. It's more than 30 definitely. Damn. Okay. And so what are some of the tactics or tips or just maybe some things you picked up along the way, cinematography or filming wise that you know now that maybe you didn't know a month ago? Three months ago, three years ago. Anything you want to share on that? Yeah. So I, I sucked so much doing a like handheld kind of footage and my videos were so boring because of the framing. So I wished I knew small things like you taught me once, like the ninja movement of how you don't, it's more interesting to have a video. Or like a video. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It must be interesting. Yeah. It is. So like a short video of a, you have the subject and you move, even if you do it, if you do it super slow and it's like a two second, like kind of fragment, it looks way more interesting if you put the little effort of moving it, trying to make it like closer. Taking no only filming from one angle only, but like trying to get the other one, like the opposite side. It's those little details that at the end they sum and they make it way, way better and you have more footage to choose from. And B-roll, like being able to have more B-roll because you're not lazy and you're like, okay, I have to get this angle. I have to get that frame. I'm going to try it from above. I'm going to try it from these like parallel 90 degrees. I'm going to try it from this thinking of having the checklist. That's another thing that you taught me, like having checklist to do that and don't forget. So at the end of the day, you have a bunch of footage to choose from. That's huge and that makes a huge difference. 100%. Yeah, my checklist, they've grown over the years. I was talking with Luis yesterday about it. He saw my checklist. He's like, bro, what is that? I'm like, this is how I get things done. If I don't get it written down, it's not getting done. So that's huge for me and I'm glad that you brought that up because I think it's those little kind of structured elements that really make the shooting process better. And if the shooting process, well, let me back that up. If the pre-production structuring process is better, the shooting process is better. The editing process is better, which makes the editing process better, which makes the final product and the audience retention and the interest in the video and the click-through rate, whatever it is, so much better.",

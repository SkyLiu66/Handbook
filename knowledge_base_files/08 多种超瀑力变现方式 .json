        "Content": "To safely divert traffic from Xiaohongshu to your private channels, follow these guidelines. First, use group chats to funnel followers into a more controlled environment. Create a group and share the link in your posts and profile. Once followers join, use pinned messages to guide them to your desired action, such as adding you on WeChat. Second, avoid direct promotional messages in private chats, as this can lead to account suspension. Instead, use indirect methods like sharing a keyword that followers can use to find your contact information. Third, maintain a balance between promotional and non-promotional content to keep your account in good standing. By following these techniques, you can effectively divert traffic without risking penalties."

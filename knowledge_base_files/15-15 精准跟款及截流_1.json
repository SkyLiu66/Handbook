        "Content": "When selecting products to follow, consider several criteria to ensure you choose items with high potential. First, check the sales data on platforms like Xiaohongshu. Products with a few hundred sales are promising, but avoid those with extremely high sales as the market may be saturated. Second, look at the publication date of the product posts. Recent posts with ongoing engagement and positive comments indicate a product with growing popularity. Lastly, find newly listed products that have already started generating sales. These criteria help you identify products that are not only popular but also have the potential for high sales, allowing you to make informed decisions about which products to add to your store."

        "Content": "An efficient product listing strategy is crucial for new sellers to avoid overwhelming their store with too many products. Focus on listing a few high-potential items rather than a large inventory. This approach saves time and resources, allowing you to concentrate on sourcing, marketing, and managing fewer products effectively. By selecting products that are trending and have proven sales, you can ensure that your store remains organized and appealing to customers. This strategy not only simplifies inventory management but also increases the likelihood of higher sales and better customer satisfaction. Regularly update your listings based on market trends and customer feedback to maintain a dynamic and attractive product range."

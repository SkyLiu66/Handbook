            "Content": "It's crucial to understand the core logic of a platform. The methods and strategies may change, but the underlying principles, such as the basic algorithm and user psychology, remain constant. Understanding these fundamentals is key to effectively using any platform. For example, in video platforms, the algorithm reflects user satisfaction. Therefore, our ultimate goal is to serve the users and meet their needs. This understanding helps in creating content that resonates with the audience and aligns with the platform's algorithm."

            "Content": "Traditional e-commerce and content e-commerce differ significantly in their approach. Traditional e-commerce platforms like JD.com and Taobao are 'product-seeking' platforms where users search for specific items to fulfill immediate needs. In contrast, content e-commerce platforms like Douyin and Xiaohongshu are 'demand-creating' platforms. Users visit these platforms primarily for entertainment, and their shopping desires are triggered during this process. Therefore, creating engaging content that captures users' attention and subtly introduces products is essential. This approach helps in converting casual viewers into potential buyers by leveraging their entertainment-driven browsing behavior."

            "Content": "To convert viewers into buyers, building trust is crucial. Users initially visit live streaming platforms for entertainment, not shopping. Therefore, creating a compelling atmosphere through engaging content, attractive products, and a trustworthy persona is essential. The host's demeanor, the product's presentation, and the overall setting should be designed to build credibility. Offering clear benefits, addressing potential doubts, and providing excellent customer service can further enhance trust. By understanding and addressing users' psychological journey from casual viewers to confident buyers, you can significantly improve conversion rates."

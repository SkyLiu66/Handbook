        "Content": "Proper account nurturing on Xiaohongshu is crucial for achieving better engagement and avoiding being flagged as a marketing account. When you nurture your account correctly, you align it with the platform's algorithm, which helps in getting your content pushed to the right audience. This increases the chances of your posts being seen by users who are genuinely interested in your niche, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates. For instance, if you have a video with 1,000 views but only 100 are relevant, your conversion rate will be lower compared to having 500 views with 400 being relevant. Therefore, before you start posting products or marketing content, spend time nurturing your account by engaging with similar content and building a profile that the algorithm recognizes as valuable. This will make your future marketing efforts more effective and ensure a smoother operation."

        "Content": "To nurture your Xiaohongshu account effectively, follow these steps: First, determine your niche. Once you have identified what you are going to sell or promote, start by searching for similar accounts. For example, if you are selling traditional Chinese skirts (马面裙), search for other accounts in this niche. Engage with these accounts by liking, commenting, and following them. This helps the algorithm understand your interests and align your account with similar content. Next, refresh your homepage and interact with the content that matches your niche. Repeat this process multiple times a day for about three to five days. The goal is to have at least 50% of your homepage content related to your niche. This indicates that your account is well-nurtured and ready for marketing activities. By following these steps, you ensure that your account is aligned with the right audience, making your marketing efforts more effective."

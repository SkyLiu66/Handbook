        "Content": "Removing watermarks from images and videos is essential to avoid being flagged for content theft on various platforms. Two recommended apps for this task are Longmao Master and Chuangzuo Mao. To use Longmao Master, first, copy the link of the desired image or video from Xiaohongshu. Open Longmao Master, allow it to paste the copied link, and then extract the content. The app will automatically remove the watermark and save the clean image or video to your gallery. Similarly, Chuangzuo Mao works in the same way but currently supports only Douyin. These apps are user-friendly and efficient for batch processing multiple images or videos at once."

To use Woniu Qu Shuiyin Pro, copy the link of the content from Xiaohongshu, paste it into the mini program, and click on the 'Remove Watermark' button. The program will process the content and save the watermark-free version to your gallery. Qingdou works similarly. However, a downside to these mini programs is the frequent advertisements. Despite this, they offer a free and convenient solution for watermark removal."

        "Content": "While tools for watermark removal are highly effective, they have limitations. Some creators add custom anti-theft tags to their content, which these tools cannot remove. For example, if an image or video has text or logos embedded by the creator, these will remain even after using watermark removal tools. In such cases, it is best to avoid using these materials. Additionally, always respect the original creator's work and use watermark removal tools ethically. Overuse of these tools can lead to content being flagged or accounts being penalized on platforms like Xiaohongshu."

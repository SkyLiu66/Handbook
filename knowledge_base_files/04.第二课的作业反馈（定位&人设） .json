        "Content": "Topic selection is the most crucial element in content creation, even more important than the cover, title, and content itself. A well-chosen topic can significantly increase the chances of creating viral content. Many creators fail to produce popular content because their topics do not resonate with a broad audience. Common mistakes include sharing personal life details or selfies, which lack user-centric value. Users seek content that provides value, such as makeup tips or emotional satisfaction. Therefore, your content must create value for the user to attract their attention. Another mistake is blindly emulating celebrities or major influencers, whose large follower base allows them to post anything and still gain traction. As an ordinary creator, you need to focus on topics that cover a wide audience. For example, topics like self-discipline, financial success, and relationships are universally appealing. By choosing broad topics, you increase the likelihood of your content becoming viral. Conversely, niche topics, while valuable, have a smaller audience and are less likely to go viral. Therefore, selecting topics that appeal to a wide audience is essential for achieving viral success."

        ],
        "Content": "Creating user resonance involves tapping into shared emotions and experiences to engage your audience. Resonance is achieved when your content evokes similar feelings or experiences in your audience, leading to emotional engagement. For example, the term 'small-town test-taker' became a viral topic because it resonated with many people who felt marginalized. By addressing this shared experience, content creators were able to evoke strong emotional responses, leading to high engagement. To create resonance, focus on common experiences or emotions that your target audience can relate to. This could be anything from overcoming challenges to celebrating small victories. By providing emotional value, you encourage your audience to engage with your content, share it, and support it. This emotional connection is a powerful tool for building a loyal audience and increasing the likelihood of your content going viral. Therefore, understanding and leveraging user resonance is essential for effective content creation."

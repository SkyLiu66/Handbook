        "Content": "When it comes to content strategy on Xiaohongshu, both video and text have their unique advantages. Videos generally attract more traffic compared to text-based posts, making them ideal for increasing visibility and engagement. However, text posts tend to have a higher conversion rate, meaning they are more effective in driving sales or other desired actions. Therefore, a balanced approach is recommended. Start by creating high-quality text posts to establish a strong foundation. Once you have a good number of text posts, incorporate videos to boost your reach and engagement. This combination allows you to leverage the strengths of both formats, ensuring that you attract a wide audience while also achieving high conversion rates. By strategically balancing video and text content, you can maximize your impact on Xiaohongshu."

        "Content": "Optimizing engagement on Xiaohongshu involves actively managing comments and strategically using paid promotions. Responding to comments can significantly boost interaction and increase the visibility of your posts. Encourage users to follow you by asking them to send private messages, which requires them to follow your account. This increases your account's weight and improves the performance of your posts. Additionally, using secondary accounts to leave positive comments can enhance the perceived value of your posts. When it comes to paid promotions, start with small budgets to test the waters. Use the 'Quick Promotion' feature to boost posts that have already gained some traction. This helps in leveraging existing momentum to attract more organic traffic. Avoid relying solely on paid promotions, as this can limit your ability to gain free traffic. Instead, use paid promotions to complement your organic efforts, ensuring a balanced and sustainable growth strategy."

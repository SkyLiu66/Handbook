        "Content": "To avoid violations on Xiaohongshu, it's essential to diversify your content. Instead of relying heavily on images, aim to post 20% text and images and 80% videos. Videos can be created by editing images into video format with background music and templates. This reduces the risk of being flagged for plagiarism. If you do get a complaint from the original content creator, handle it professionally. Contact them via WeChat and offer a small compensation, such as 200 to 1000 yuan, depending on your profit from the post. If the system flags your content for violations, delete it immediately to avoid further penalties. Posting regular, non-commercial content like scenic views can help restore your account's standing. If the situation is severe, consider creating a new account and following a structured posting strategy to regain traction."

If your account gets restricted, create a new account and continue posting high-quality content. Use your main account to post scenic or aesthetically pleasing content to maintain activity and account health. Posting consistently, even if it's non-commercial content, helps keep your account active and reduces the risk of restrictions. By managing your content strategy effectively, you can maintain a healthy account and continue to grow your presence on the platform."

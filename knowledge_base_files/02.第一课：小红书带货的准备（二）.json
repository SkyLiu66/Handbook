It's recommended to prepare 3 to 6 accounts to test different products and increase your chances of success. Each product should be tested with at least two accounts. For full-time sellers, it's advisable to use one phone per account to avoid any potential issues with the platform's algorithms. When setting up your store, you can choose between a personal store, an individual business store, or a corporate store. Ensure you have the necessary documentation, such as a personal ID or a business license, and consider the type of products you plan to sell.

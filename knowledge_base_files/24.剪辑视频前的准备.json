Identify its background music and use tools like Fufuradar or music recognition apps like KuGou to find and download the music. If the music requires a membership to download, use alternative websites to obtain it. For the script, listen to the video and manually transcribe the text, or use software like Jianying to extract subtitles. Organize these elements in a dedicated folder for easy access during editing. Proper preparation ensures a smoother editing process and helps achieve better results."

Once you have extracted the music and transcribed the script from reference videos, organize them in a structured manner. Use the music that has already proven successful in similar videos to avoid the trial-and-error process. For the script, mix and match lines from different successful videos to create a cohesive and engaging narrative. This approach not only saves time but also increases the likelihood of your video performing well. By using elements that have already been tested and appreciated by the audience, you can create high-quality videos that are more likely to go viral."

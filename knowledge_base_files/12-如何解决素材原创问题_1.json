        "Content": "Editing images to create original content involves several steps. First, prepare two images: one that you want to publish and another random image. If the image contains a person's face, use effects or crop the image to remove the face. Open the Meitu Xiuxiu app and select 'Image Beautification.' Choose the image you want to edit and adjust its aspect ratio to 3:4. Randomly crop parts of the image to change its composition. Next, adjust the image's parameters such as brightness, contrast, exposure, and highlights. Use values between -5 to +10 for these adjustments. Apply a filter that enhances the image without drastically altering its original appearance. Add stickers to the image, including both your own original images and special effect stickers. Ensure that the stickers do not overly affect the image's quality. By following these steps, you can create an edited image that appears original and is less likely to be flagged for plagiarism."

        "Content": "Editing videos to create original content can be more complex than editing images. Start by preparing two video clips: one that you want to publish and another random clip. Open the Jianying app and select 'Start Creating.' Import the video you want to edit and adjust its aspect ratio to 3:4. If the video contains a person's face, add a cartoon face effect to cover it. Separate the audio from the video if the person is speaking, to avoid altering the original speech. Adjust the video's parameters such as brightness, contrast, and exposure, using values between -5 to +10. Apply a subtle filter to enhance the video. Add a 'Picture-in-Picture' overlay with your own original video, adjusting its transparency to blend it in. Finally, remove a few frames from the original video and replace them with duplicated frames to create a seamless edit. Export the video in 2K or 4K resolution at 60 frames per second. This method ensures that the video appears original and is less likely to be flagged for plagiarism."

For images, use apps like Meitu Xiuxiu to add both original and special effect stickers. Place stickers in the four corners of the image to ensure they do not interfere with the main content. Adjust the transparency of the stickers to blend them into the image. For videos, use the Jianying app to add stickers and effects. Place stickers in the four corners of the video frame and adjust their transparency. Additionally, apply subtle effects to the video to enhance its appearance without drastically changing the original content. By adding stickers and effects, you can create unique and original content that stands out and is less likely to be flagged for plagiarism. This method not only enhances the visual appeal of your content but also ensures compliance with platform guidelines."

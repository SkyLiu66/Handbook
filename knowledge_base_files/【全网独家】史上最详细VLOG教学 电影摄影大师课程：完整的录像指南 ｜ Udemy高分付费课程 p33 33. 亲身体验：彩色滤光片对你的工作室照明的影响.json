So, one thing that I really wanted to share with you that you can get around this kind of more bluish lighting, because it can have its drawbacks. If we are lighting our subject and her frontal lighting is this bluish light, but let's say we are in a different scenario and there is daylight in the background, that daylight is going to be extra warm because our white balance is set to make her lighting look neutral. The background is going to change color wise a lot. So, in this scenario we are going to actually get a little bit more of a tan lighting, which is actually really great for talking footage. And it's going to be really good for you to see this demonstration as well if you have different color temperatures. On set, sorry, I just spit everywhere. Different color temperatures on set that you are working with. So, what we are going to use is color gels. And I will just kind of briefly run over how to set it up on your light. Now you want to make sure you are not putting these on a light that gets hot. These lights don't heat up, so we are not going to have any issues, but this will melt as if you put it in a microwave on your light. So you want to be sure. Before trying this, you want to make sure your lights don't get too hot. This is a little bit warm, but it's not going to be an issue. So we want to cover our entire light with our gel. And you can see the difference on my face here. You can already see the kind of effect this is going to have. Okay. And we are going to put one more down here. Voila. Now, we are also going to add a gel to this side. And this is going to really soften up our scenario. For two reasons. It's going to diffuse the light and take down the intensity of our main lights a few stops. So we are going to definitely have to change the exposure on our camera. And we are definitely going to have to change our white balance. So on this light, we are going to do the same thing. Again, this light does not heat up, so we are good to attach our gel directly to the light source. Now. Okay. So if we look at our scene, it's a lot softer. But you can see now it's a very like warm scenario. So we're going to start by increasing our ISO to get the proper exposure. And we are going to then change our white balance to match our new color situation. Right about there. So now you can see the difference between. Without the color gels. And with the color gels. A lot softer, a lot more of a warm feel and just kind of taking away that studio lighting kind of setup. So it's really effective to use if you want to match the color temperatures of your situation. Now I do want to mention that we didn't add a gel to our hair light. It's going to make the hair light stand out even more because the color temperature is completely different, which can work for you. Sometimes a golden hair light looks really nice. Sometimes it doesn't. So you really have to use your own discernment for your shooting situation. Cool. So that wraps it up for our artificial lighting setup scenario. So I think you guys should have some really good tips and tricks to take your setup that you're shooting from this beginning looking stage to now this final setup. Okay. Perfect. Now in the next lecture we're going to do the similar kind of lighting setup, but we're going to be using only natural light. So I will see you in the next lecture.",

Start by identifying current trends and popular topics within your niche. Use platforms like Douyin, Weibo, and Zhihu to find trending topics and hashtags. Once you have identified a hot topic, create content that aligns with it while adding your unique perspective. For example, if a celebrity or event is trending, find a way to relate it to your niche and create content around it. This not only makes your content timely but also increases its chances of being discovered by a larger audience. Additionally, keep an eye on upcoming events and holidays, and plan your content calendar accordingly. By staying ahead of trends and creating relevant content, you can attract more viewers and increase engagement. Remember, the key is to be quick and creative, ensuring that your content stands out while being relevant to the current trend."

        "Content": "Investing in paid promotion, such as Xiaohongshu's 'Shutiao' (薯条), can significantly boost the visibility of your notes. To effectively use paid promotion, follow these steps: First, choose notes that have shown good organic performance within the last month. These notes are more likely to benefit from additional exposure. Second, decide between 'Content Heating' and 'Marketing Promotion.' Content Heating is for personal users promoting non-commercial notes, while Marketing Promotion is for both personal and business users and requires advertising credentials. Third, set your promotion parameters. You can choose to increase views, likes, or followers, and customize your target audience by age, gender, interests, and location. Alternatively, use the 'Smart Selection' option for automated targeting. Finally, fund your promotion through the Xiaohongshu wallet. Note that iOS users may incur a 30% fee, so using an Android device can save costs. By strategically investing in paid promotion, you can amplify your reach and attract more followers."

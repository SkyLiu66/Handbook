        "Content": "When dealing with non-original content on Xiaohongshu, there are two main approaches to consider. The first method involves modifying your material using editing software like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro to make it appear original. This includes changing aspects such as angles, lighting, and other visual elements. The second method is creating 'pseudo-original' content. This involves replicating the style and format of successful posts but shooting the material yourself. By doing so, you avoid directly copying others' work, which can lead to violations. It's crucial to understand that while these methods can help in the short term, the platform strongly supports original content. Therefore, for long-term success, focus on creating genuinely original posts. This not only aligns with the platform's guidelines but also helps in building a sustainable and credible account."

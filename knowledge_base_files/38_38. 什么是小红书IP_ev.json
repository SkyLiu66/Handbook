        "Content": "IP, or Intellectual Property, on Xiaohongshu refers to the creation and development of a personal brand that conveys specific values and ideas to the audience. Unlike merely opening a store, building an IP involves showcasing personal values and perspectives through the content you share. This personal brand should not be overly narrow or controversial, as it can lead to negative impacts on your overall image. Instead, focus on conveying positive and helpful messages that resonate with your audience. The goal is to create a long-term, sustainable presence that offers value to your followers, rather than just sharing everyday life updates. Building a strong IP requires consistent effort and a clear understanding of the values you want to communicate."

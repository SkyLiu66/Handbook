    "Content": "Successful interior designers on Instagram have a clear strategy that includes knowing their ideal clients, planning content ahead, maintaining a cohesive visual theme, providing valuable content, and balancing promotion. Consistent posting is crucial for Instagram success as it influences the algorithm and helps followers remember your brand. Providing valuable content, such as design tips, how-to reels, and information-packed carousels, helps boost engagement and build trust in your business. Direct promotion should not be the top priority on Instagram. Instead, focus on providing value and establishing trust through authentic and relatable content."

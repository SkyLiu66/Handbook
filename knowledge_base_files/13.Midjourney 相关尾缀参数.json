        "Content": "The aspect ratio (AR) parameter in MidJourney is crucial for setting the dimensions of your images. It defines the width-to-height ratio of the image. Common aspect ratios include 9:16 for TikTok, 4:3 for Xigua Video, and 2:3 for standard MidJourney images. You can adjust the aspect ratio based on the platform or the specific requirements of your project. For instance, a 9:16 ratio is ideal for vertical videos on TikTok, while a 4:3 ratio suits more traditional video formats. To set the aspect ratio, use the '--ar' parameter followed by the desired ratio. This ensures that your images are correctly formatted for their intended use, enhancing their visual appeal and effectiveness."

        "Content": "The Q parameter in MidJourney controls the quality of the generated images. It ranges from 0.25 to 5, with higher values producing more detailed images but taking longer to render. Conversely, lower values result in faster rendering times but less detailed images. For example, setting the Q parameter to 1 will produce a standard quality image, while setting it to 3 will enhance the details, making elements like hair or fur more distinct. To use this parameter, append '--q' followed by the desired value to your command. This allows you to balance between rendering time and image detail based on your needs. Experimenting with different Q values can help you find the optimal setting for your specific project."

        "Content": "The Seed parameter in MidJourney is used to maintain consistency across multiple images. It ensures that the generated images have a similar style and composition. This is particularly useful when creating a series of images that need to look cohesive. To use the Seed parameter, first generate an image and note its Seed value, which can be found by clicking the reaction icon on the image. Then, use this Seed value in subsequent commands to ensure consistency. For example, if you want to change the color of a character's clothing while keeping the overall style the same, you can use the same Seed value with different descriptive keywords. This technique helps in creating a unified visual narrative across multiple images."

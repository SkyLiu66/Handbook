        "Content": "To create viral content on Xiaohongshu, it's essential to understand the core logic behind it. The first principle is to avoid self-indulgence and adopt a user-centric mindset. Many creators mistakenly believe that their personal preferences will resonate with the audience, but this is often not the case. Instead, it's crucial to respect data and user feedback. For instance, one of our successful students, Fang Haohao, initially struggled with content that didn't align with her audience's interests. By analyzing successful posts and understanding what users value, she was able to adjust her strategy and create content that provided real value to her audience. This approach involves studying viral content, breaking it down, and identifying common elements that resonate with users. By focusing on user needs and preferences, creators can produce content that is more likely to go viral. This method is not about copying but about understanding the underlying principles that make content successful and applying them to your unique context."

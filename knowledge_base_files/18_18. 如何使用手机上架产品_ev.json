Next, provide detailed product attributes such as material, style, and applicable seasons. For example, if the product is a dress, specify whether it is suitable for spring, summer, autumn, or winter. When setting the price, consider the cost price and add a margin to cover potential discounts and ensure profitability. A common practice is to set the price at twice the cost price plus a small additional amount. For instance, if the cost price is 58 yuan, you might set the selling price at 121 yuan to include a margin for discounts. Once all details are filled in, submit the product for review. Accurate and detailed product information helps build customer trust and can lead to higher sales."

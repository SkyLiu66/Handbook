        "Content": "Utilizing competitor analysis for pricing strategy involves examining the data from similar accounts to inform your own pricing decisions. Start by identifying competitor accounts on platforms like Douyin (TikTok). Use tools such as 'Juliang BAIYIN' to gather data on these accounts. Look at metrics such as the average price range of products they sell and the purchasing behavior of their followers. For example, if a competitor's followers typically buy products priced between 50 to 100 yuan, this indicates a viable price range for your products. Additionally, analyze the types of products that perform well on these accounts. This can help you understand what your target audience is willing to spend. By leveraging this data, you can set competitive prices that align with market expectations and consumer behavior. This approach not only helps in setting the right price but also in selecting products that are more likely to succeed."

        "Content": "Matching product price with audience purchasing power is crucial for maximizing sales and engagement. Begin by analyzing the purchasing behavior of your audience. Use tools to gather data on the average spending capacity of your followers. For instance, if your audience predominantly purchases items priced between 10 to 20 yuan, it would be strategic to offer products within this range. This ensures that your products are affordable and appealing to your target market. Additionally, consider the type of products that align with your audience's interests and needs. Products that offer unique features or solve specific problems tend to perform better. For example, a waterproof phone holder for the bathroom might be priced higher but offers significant utility, making it a desirable purchase. By aligning your product prices with the purchasing power of your audience, you can enhance your conversion rates and overall sales performance."

        "Content": "Adjusting pricing based on sales data is an effective way to optimize your conversion rates. Start by collecting data on your current sales and identifying the price ranges that generate the most sales. For example, if you notice that products priced between 10 to 20 yuan account for 84.7% of your sales, it indicates a sweet spot for pricing. Use this data to adjust your future product prices within this range to maximize sales. Additionally, consider offering bundled products or promotional deals to increase the average order value. For instance, if a single phone case sells for 10 yuan, offering a bundle of five for 30 yuan can attract more buyers and increase your overall revenue. Regularly review your sales data to identify trends and make necessary adjustments. This iterative process helps in fine-tuning your pricing strategy to better meet market demands and improve your sales performance."

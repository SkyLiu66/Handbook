        "Content": "There is a widespread misconception that nurturing an account on Xiaohongshu involves activities like following competitors, commenting on their posts, and engaging with similar content to build a profile. However, this is not necessary. Xiaohongshu's algorithm pushes content based on user preferences, not on the type of content the user engages with. Therefore, there is no need to 'nurture' your account by following or interacting with competitors. The platform does not use these interactions to determine the reach of your posts. Instead, the visibility of your posts depends on the quality and relevance of the content you create. Focus on producing high-quality, engaging content rather than trying to manipulate the algorithm through unnecessary interactions."

        "Content": "When setting up a new account on Xiaohongshu, it is important to follow a few key steps to ensure a smooth start. First, complete the basic profile information such as avatar, name, and personal introduction, but avoid making any changes until you are ready to launch your store. Spend the first three days using the account as a regular user: browse content, follow users, like and comment on posts, and engage naturally. This helps to avoid being flagged as a marketing account. After this initial period, you can start listing products and posting notes. The goal is to establish a normal user behavior pattern before transitioning to promotional activities. This approach helps in maintaining a good account standing and ensures better engagement with your content."

        "Content": "Transitioning an old account to a new niche on Xiaohongshu involves a few strategic steps. First, identify whether the account is a personal one or previously used for a different niche. If it is a personal account, you can directly open a store and start listing products. For accounts previously used for a different niche, begin by hiding all old posts. This can be done by setting them to 'only visible to me.' Next, gradually delete these posts, about 20 per day, to avoid sudden changes that might affect the account's standing. Once the old content is cleared, you can start posting new content relevant to the new niche. This method ensures a smooth transition and helps in maintaining the account's credibility and engagement levels."

        "Content": "When a note or post suddenly goes viral, it presents an opportunity to maximize its reach and engagement. If the note initially did not include a product link (挂车), you can add it by re-editing the post. To do this, click on the three dots in the upper right corner and select 'Edit.' Then, associate the relevant product and confirm. This action will update the post's publication date to the current day while retaining all previous likes, comments, and shares. This method ensures that the post remains relevant and continues to attract engagement. Additionally, if the post's views have plateaued, you can refresh its appearance by slightly modifying the cover or adding small stickers or text. This minor update can help reignite interest and push the post back into users' feeds."

        "Content": "Adding product links to your viral notes can significantly boost engagement and drive sales. When a post gains traction, it's an ideal time to introduce related products to capitalize on the increased visibility. To add a product link, go to the post's edit menu and select 'Associate Product.' This will allow you to link the product directly to the post. Once confirmed, the post will be republished with the current date, making it appear fresh while keeping all previous interactions intact. This strategy not only enhances the post's relevance but also provides a seamless way for viewers to purchase the featured product. By leveraging the viral nature of the post, you can effectively convert engagement into sales."

        "Content": "If a previously popular post starts to lose momentum, refreshing it can help regain its engagement. To do this, access the post's edit menu and make minor adjustments to the cover or add small elements like stickers or text. These subtle changes can make the post appear new and interesting without altering its core content. After making the adjustments, republish the post. This will update its publication date to the current day, giving it a fresh appearance in users' feeds. Importantly, all previous likes, comments, and shares will remain, preserving the post's social proof. This technique is a simple yet effective way to breathe new life into stagnant posts and maintain their visibility."

For instance, short, engaging videos work well on social media, while longer, in-depth content is better suited for YouTube or blogs. Additionally, cross-promote your content by linking your platforms and encouraging your audience to follow you on multiple channels. This multi-platform strategy ensures that your content reaches a broader audience and maximizes its impact."

Navigate to the 'Marketing' section and focus on two main activities: 'Event Registration' and 'Product Promotions.' Event registration allows you to participate in official events that can drive traffic to your store. For product promotions, you can set up discounts to attract customers. For example, if you are selling a cup, you can create a promotion by setting the original price and the discounted price. Ensure the promotion period is long enough to avoid frequent changes. Compare your prices with competitors to ensure your discounts are attractive. This strategy helps in increasing conversion rates and attracting more customers."

        "Content": "Competitor analysis is crucial when setting prices for your products. By understanding how much your competitors are charging, you can set competitive prices that attract customers while ensuring profitability. For instance, if a competitor is selling a raincoat at a certain price, you can set your price slightly lower to attract more customers. This approach helps in positioning your product effectively in the market. Additionally, consider any platform-specific discounts or promotions that might affect the final price. For example, Xiaohongshu often offers new customer discounts, which should be factored into your pricing strategy. By keeping an eye on competitor prices and platform promotions, you can set optimal prices that enhance your market position."

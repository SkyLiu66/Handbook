        "Content": "When starting a business or selecting products to sell, it's crucial to choose a specific niche. The more focused your niche, the better. Avoid broad categories like 'women's clothing' and instead opt for something more specific, such as 'blue hoodies' or 'down jackets.' This specificity helps in targeting a particular audience and reduces competition. For instance, if you decide to sell food products, don't just choose 'food' as your category. Break it down into smaller niches like 'snacks,' 'biscuits,' 'cakes,' 'grains,' 'nuts,' and 'candied fruits.' This approach allows you to cater to a specific market segment, making your marketing efforts more effective and increasing your chances of success."

        "Content": "One effective method for selecting products is to utilize sales rankings. Platforms often have daily updated sales rankings that show which products are selling the most. For example, products that have sold 30,000, 40,000, or even 100,000 units are likely to be in high demand. By focusing on these high-demand products, you can increase your chances of success. Start by identifying the main category you are interested in, such as 'food' or 'clothing,' and then narrow it down to specific subcategories. This way, you can find products that not only have high sales volumes but also fit well within your chosen niche. Using sales rankings as a guide helps you make informed decisions and reduces the risk of selecting products that may not perform well."

        "Content": "After selecting a product, it's essential to evaluate its reviews and sales performance. Look at both positive and negative reviews to get a comprehensive understanding of the product's quality and customer satisfaction. Pay special attention to negative reviews to identify any recurring issues that could affect your sales. Additionally, consider the sales volume and compare it with the number of reviews to gauge the product's popularity and reliability. High sales with a low percentage of negative reviews indicate a good product. You can also use positive review images in your marketing materials to build trust and credibility. By thoroughly evaluating reviews and sales data, you can make more informed decisions and choose products that are likely to succeed in the market."

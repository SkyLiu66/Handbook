For example, if you're in the fashion niche, begin with specific items like shoes or hats and explore various aspects such as seasonal wear or styling tips. This focused approach helps build a strong foundation and allows for detailed content creation. Over time, you can broaden your scope to include more general topics like overall outfit coordination. Remember, continuous innovation is crucial; while it's beneficial to replicate successful content initially, developing your unique style and ideas will sustain long-term growth. Consistent innovation ensures that your content remains fresh and engaging for your audience."

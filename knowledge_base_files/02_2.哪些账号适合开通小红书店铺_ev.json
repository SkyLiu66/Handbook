        "Content": "Opening a Xiaohongshu store is feasible whether you are in China or abroad. If you are in China and have a mainland ID, you can open a personal store without needing a business license. For those abroad with a mainland ID, the same applies. However, if you are abroad and do not have a mainland ID, you will need an overseas business license to open a specialty store or flagship store. This allows you to market your products to China. The process is relatively straightforward compared to other platforms, making it accessible for many users."

        "Content": "When deciding whether to use a new or old account for your Xiaohongshu store, consider the account's history and activity. If your old account has been used frequently and has a mix of content, it might be better to start fresh with a new account to ensure your tags and audience are aligned with your new business goals. If the old account has minimal activity and no significant following, it can be repurposed. However, if the account has a substantial following but irrelevant tags, it is advisable to switch to a new account to avoid complications in rebranding."

        "Content": "To determine if your Xiaohongshu account is restricted, you can perform a simple test. Post a regular, everyday note and monitor its performance over 24 hours. If the note receives around 50 views, your account is likely functioning normally. If it garners significantly fewer views, your account might be restricted due to previous violations. In such cases, it is recommended to delete the account and start anew. This ensures that you are working with a clean slate, free from any previous penalties that could hinder your store's performance."

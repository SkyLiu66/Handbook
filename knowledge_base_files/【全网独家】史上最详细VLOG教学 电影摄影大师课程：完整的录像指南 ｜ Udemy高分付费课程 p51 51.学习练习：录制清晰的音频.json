I would much rather record my audio on a decent microphone in a setup with good sound dynamics than a super expensive microphone in an echoey room with loud, distracting, buzzing noises or anything that's going to really degrade the overall clarity of your sound. So now what we're going to do is work on recording your new and improved audio with the techniques that we've learned. So we're going to be synthesizing these techniques and you're going to be able to apply these enhancements to your own recording. So I want you to record your voice using this new knowledge and this can be used as the voiceover for the b-roll montage. We're going to shoot later in the course. I mentioned that a few times. If you haven't gotten your voiceover yet, don't worry, but it is important because we're going to keep building these techniques on top of each other so that by the end of the course, you're going to have everything that we brought together all in one video. That's really the goal. One video that you walk away with, with all these techniques that are highly produced with a better final product. So while you're doing your voiceover, getting your more enhanced audio, you're going to be able to record a video of that if you'd like as well, or you can just record audio of it. Totally up to you. So your assignment is to apply these techniques we've learned to get crystal clear sounding vocals. The first example that you're going to record is your vocals in a normal environment without any changes or without any use of the techniques we've gone over. In the second example, you're going to hit the record button and record your vocals with the new techniques used. These techniques are. Proper mic settings, proper placement, choosing the right type of environment, canceling out any kind of background noise makers and setting up your surroundings with good sound dynamics, using a DIY setup or using any type of belongings or equipment that you have that's going to set up a great sounding environment. Then you want to export and share your audio link with the combined before and after to the Q and A section. So that you and your other students can learn from each other's mistakes, learn from what each other are doing right and so on. So with that said, go ahead and upload your before and afters and I will see you in the next learning lesson.",

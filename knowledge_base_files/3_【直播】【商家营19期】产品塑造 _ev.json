High-quality content that resonates with users is more likely to receive better engagement and, consequently, more visibility on the platform. Therefore, it is crucial to focus on creating valuable and engaging content rather than merely increasing the number of posts. Consistently producing high-quality content will help improve your account's overall performance and reach on Xiaohongshu."

    "Content": "Instagram's ranking algorithm determines what content you see in your Feed, Stories, Explore, and Reels by assessing various signals such as post information, author information, your activity, and your history of interactions. In Feed and Stories, the algorithm ranks content based on how interested it thinks you are in each post. In Explore, the algorithm uses collaborative filtering to recommend content similar to posts you've liked. In Reels, the algorithm ranks videos based on your activity, interaction history with the author, Reel information, and author information. Shadow banning and community guidelines also influence content visibility. You can influence what you see by deciding who to follow, using close friends, muting people, and marking content as not interested. Instagram is exploring ways to give users more control over their experiences."

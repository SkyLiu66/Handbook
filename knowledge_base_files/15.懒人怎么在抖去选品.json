        "Content": "To find profitable products on Douyin, start by searching for popular videos and users. Look for products that have high sales figures, indicating their popularity. Once you identify a potential product, verify its performance on Xiaohongshu by searching for the same product and checking its sales and user engagement. This cross-platform validation ensures that the product is not only popular on Douyin but also has potential on Xiaohongshu. Additionally, check the product's profit margin on wholesale platforms like 1688. A good product should have a profit margin of at least 50%. By following these steps, you can identify products that are both popular and profitable, increasing your chances of success in e-commerce."

        "Content": "New sellers often struggle with content creation. A practical approach is to leverage existing content from successful sellers. Find videos of the product you want to sell, and make minor adjustments to the parameters to create your version. This method saves time and effort, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your business. However, ensure that the product is not already being sold on Xiaohongshu using the same videos to avoid duplication issues. While this approach minimizes the risk of content creation, it is not entirely risk-free. There is still a chance of content being flagged for duplication, but the risk is significantly lower. This strategy is particularly useful for beginners who are not comfortable creating original content."

        "Content": "Using pre-existing content has its pros and cons. The primary advantage is that it saves time and effort in content creation, making it easier for new sellers to get started. You don't need to spend hours brainstorming and creating new videos. However, the downside is that you become heavily reliant on the original content creator. If they stop producing content or if their content becomes widely used, you may find yourself without new material to post. Additionally, while the risk of being flagged for duplication is lower, it is not entirely eliminated. Therefore, while this method is convenient for beginners, it is essential to gradually develop your content creation skills to ensure long-term success."

        "Content": "Using high-engagement content is a powerful strategy for quickly gaining followers and driving traffic on Xiaohongshu. The key is to identify and utilize content that has a proven track record of high engagement, such as posts with over 300 likes. These posts often go viral and can significantly boost your visibility. To implement this strategy, start by researching and collecting high-engagement posts. You can find these posts in project materials or by consulting with experts who have access to such content. Once you have the content, schedule your posts for optimal times, such as after 11 PM, and post every half hour. Each account should post three to five pieces of content. This method can result in rapid follower growth, potentially reaching 1,000 followers overnight. However, it is crucial to ensure that your account is well-prepared, with all preliminary steps like content creation and account setup completed. This strategy is highly effective but should be used sparingly to avoid account suspension."

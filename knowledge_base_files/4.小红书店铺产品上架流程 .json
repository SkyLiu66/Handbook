After migrating the product link using tools like 'Ant Moving,' you need to fill in various details such as product categories, brands, and logistics options. Ensure that you specify whether the product supports seven-day returns, pre-sale options, and the shipping timeline. For pricing, a common strategy is to take the original price from platforms like Taobao or Tmall, multiply it by two, and add an additional amount (e.g., 6 or 10 yuan). This pricing strategy allows room for offering significant discounts through coupons, which can attract more buyers. By carefully setting up product details and pricing, you can enhance the appeal of your listings and improve sales performance on Xiaohongshu."

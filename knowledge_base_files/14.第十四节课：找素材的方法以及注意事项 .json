        "Content": "Finding content material is crucial for creating engaging posts. One effective method is using the Douyin app. Start by opening Douyin and clicking on the magnifying glass icon on the homepage. Use the image search feature to find similar products. If the product is being live-streamed, click on the live stream to enter the broadcaster's profile and check their other works. Another method is to look for posts with fewer likes, as these are less likely to be widely used. Focus on content posted within the last 7 to 15 days and prioritize original content creators. To save the material, copy the link and use tools like Longmao to extract and save the content to your album. Aim to save at least 50 pieces of content for each product to ensure you have a variety of material to work with."

        "Content": "When selecting content material, it's important to focus on a few key criteria. First, prioritize content that has been posted within the last 7 to 15 days. This ensures that the material is current and relevant. Second, look for original content creators. These are users who consistently post unique content, often with a consistent background or style. Original content is more likely to be high-quality and less likely to be flagged for duplication. Third, avoid content from users who appear to be reposting or aggregating material from other sources. These users often have inconsistent backgrounds and styles, indicating that the content may not be original. By focusing on recent, original content, you can ensure that your posts are engaging and less likely to encounter issues with duplication or copyright."

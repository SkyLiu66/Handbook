        "Content": "When registering for Xiaohongshu, it is crucial to use phone numbers from the three main mobile operators: China Unicom, China Mobile, and China Telecom. These operators are reliable and ensure better performance and fewer issues with your account. Avoid using numbers from lesser-known operators, as they may not be as dependable and could negatively impact your account's performance. Using a number from a reputable operator helps in maintaining a stable connection and reduces the risk of your account being flagged or restricted. This step is essential for the long-term success of your Xiaohongshu account."

        "Content": "To maintain the integrity and performance of your Xiaohongshu account, it is recommended to follow the 'one device, one SIM, one account' rule. This means using a single phone with one SIM card for one Xiaohongshu account. Using multiple accounts on the same device or SIM card can lead to issues such as account restrictions or reduced visibility. Xiaohongshu, like many other platforms, monitors account activity closely. If it detects multiple accounts on the same device, it may limit the reach of your posts or even suspend your accounts. By adhering to this rule, you ensure that your account remains in good standing and avoids unnecessary complications."

        "Content": "Nurturing your Xiaohongshu account involves several key steps to ensure it gains traction and performs well. First, after registering, avoid changing your username or posting notes immediately. Instead, spend time engaging with content related to your niche. Spend about 20 minutes daily browsing and interacting with posts from similar accounts. This helps the algorithm understand your account's focus and improves your visibility within that niche. Search for and follow accounts in your niche, like their posts, and engage as a regular user would. This activity signals to the platform that your account is relevant to that niche. Continue this process for about a week. Successful nurturing is indicated when your feed consistently shows content related to your niche. Once this is achieved, you can start posting your content, ensuring it aligns with the interests of your target audience. This methodical approach helps build a strong foundation for your account, leading to better engagement and growth."

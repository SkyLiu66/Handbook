        "Content": "Order management is a crucial aspect of dropshipping. The first step involves accessing the dropshipping management section where you can view orders from the past three months. This section includes options for submitting orders, synchronizing orders, applying for refunds, and managing logistics. For instance, if a customer has purchased an item for 169 yuan, you can synchronize the order within seven days to ensure timely shipment. It's essential to match the product specifications with those of the supplier. If the specifications differ, you need to select the appropriate options to ensure consistency. Additionally, you can add procurement links, such as copying the link from a platform like Tmall. Ensuring that the product attributes match those of the supplier is vital. Once everything is aligned, you can submit the order for processing. This systematic approach ensures that all orders are managed efficiently, reducing errors and improving customer satisfaction."

When managing orders, it's crucial to verify that the product specifications, such as size, color, and model, align with those listed by the supplier. If there are discrepancies, you need to adjust the specifications accordingly. For example, if you are selling a pair of white shoes, ensure that the procurement link and the product attributes match exactly with what the supplier offers. This includes verifying the brand, color, and any other specific attributes. Consistency in product specifications helps in avoiding customer dissatisfaction and returns. By meticulously matching the product attributes, you ensure that the customer receives exactly what they ordered, thereby enhancing their shopping experience and trust in your service."

        "Content": "Nurturing your Xiaohongshu account is crucial for increasing its weight and improving its chances of gaining traction. Accounts that undergo a nurturing process tend to have higher weight compared to those that do not. This higher weight translates to better visibility and higher chances of gaining followers and engagement. The nurturing process involves simulating real user behavior, which helps the platform recognize the account as genuine rather than purely for marketing purposes. By nurturing your account, you ensure that it aligns with the platform's expectations of a real user, thereby increasing its credibility and reducing the likelihood of being flagged as a marketing account. This process is especially important for new accounts, as it helps them gain initial traction more quickly and effectively."

        "Content": "Maintaining a consistent physical environment is essential for the health of your Xiaohongshu account. This means using one phone and one phone number per account to avoid any suspicion of multiple accounts being managed from a single device. Avoid frequently switching between different Xiaohongshu accounts on the same device, as this can negatively impact the account's weight. For Android users, it is acceptable to use the built-in dual app feature to manage two accounts, but avoid using third-party apps for this purpose, as they can create a virtual environment that the platform may flag as suspicious. Additionally, ensure that no more than three accounts are managed under the same network to avoid detection. By adhering to these guidelines, you can maintain a stable and trustworthy account environment."

        "Content": "To nurture your Xiaohongshu account, follow these steps: First, engage with content related to your niche. For example, if you are selling women's clothing, search for and browse through related posts. Spend time viewing, liking, and commenting on these posts to simulate real user behavior. This activity helps the platform recognize your account as genuine. Continue this process for two to three days. During this period, you can also learn more about the platform and its features. The goal is to have your homepage recommendations align with the type of content you are selling. When the majority of the recommended content matches your product category, your account is considered nurtured. This process not only increases your account's weight but also ensures that your content reaches the right audience, thereby improving engagement and sales potential."

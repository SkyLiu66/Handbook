For example, if you are in the jewelry business, search for keywords like 'earrings,' 'hairpins,' and 'necklaces.' Identify accounts that frequently post popular content, as these accounts likely have effective strategies worth emulating. Examine their profile settings, posts, and follower engagement. Accounts with occasional viral posts indicate a good understanding of creating engaging content. However, if an account has many followers but consistently underperforming posts, it may not be a reliable benchmark. Conversely, accounts with fewer followers but occasional viral posts can provide valuable insights into effective content creation and account management. By studying these accounts, you can refine your own strategies and improve your performance on Xiaohongshu."

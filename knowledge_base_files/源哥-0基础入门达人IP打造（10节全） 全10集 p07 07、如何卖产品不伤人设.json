    "Content": "When live streaming sales, the key to avoiding damage to your persona and not being criticized is to establish the correct mental accounting and set appropriate flaws. First, do not exploit fans' sense of justice or moral high ground to attract attention. Instead, introduce minor flaws to reduce jealousy and skepticism. Additionally, open the mental accounting by linking the product to consumers' emotional needs (such as love, success, etc.), which can increase consumer acceptance. Remember, consumers often make purchasing decisions based on emotions rather than simple value calculations."

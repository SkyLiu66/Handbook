        "Content": "Identifying high-potential products involves analyzing various metrics to determine their market viability. Start by examining the sales data of similar products. Look for items that have a high number of sales within a short period, as this indicates strong demand. For example, a product that has sold over 200 units within 24 hours is a good candidate. Additionally, consider the number of people who have added the product to their cart within the same timeframe. A high add-to-cart rate suggests that the product is attracting significant interest. Another important metric is the difference between the number of sales and the number of reviews. A large gap indicates recent sales activity, which is a positive sign. Finally, check the seller's profile to see if they have other high-performing products. This can provide further validation of the product's potential. By focusing on these key indicators, you can make informed decisions about which products to invest in or promote."

        "Content": "Evaluating product performance on social media platforms like TikTok can provide valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences. Start by identifying products that have gone viral or received significant engagement. Metrics such as the number of likes, shares, and comments can indicate a product's popularity. For example, a product with thousands of likes and hundreds of comments within a short period is likely to be a trending item. Additionally, consider the content creator's follower count and engagement rate. High engagement from a large follower base suggests that the product resonates well with the audience. Another useful metric is the add-to-cart rate, which shows how many viewers are interested in purchasing the product. Look for products with a high add-to-cart rate within 24 hours, as this indicates strong consumer interest. Finally, review the comments to gather qualitative data on what users like or dislike about the product. This can help you refine your product selection and marketing strategies. By systematically evaluating product performance on social media, you can identify high-potential items and optimize your inventory accordingly."

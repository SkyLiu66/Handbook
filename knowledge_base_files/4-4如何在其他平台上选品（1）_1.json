        "Content": "When selecting products to sell, it's crucial to focus on items that are unique and practical. Products that are easily available in supermarkets, like tissues, are less likely to attract online buyers. Instead, opt for items that are not commonly found in local stores but have a practical use. For example, unique kitchen gadgets, specialized cleaning tools, or innovative home decor items can attract more attention. These products should not only look good but also serve a functional purpose. By offering unique and practical items, you can differentiate your store from others and meet the specific needs of your target audience, increasing the likelihood of sales."

        "Content": "Before listing a product, it's essential to evaluate its performance and authenticity. Check the product's sales figures and customer reviews to ensure they are genuine. A high sales number with a proportionate amount of reviews indicates authenticity. Conversely, if a product has high sales but very few reviews, it may be a sign of manipulated figures. Additionally, examine the main product images for clarity and appeal. If the images are cluttered or unattractive, consider replacing them with better ones. Authentic reviews and appealing visuals can significantly impact a product's success. By ensuring the product's performance and authenticity, you can build trust with your customers and improve your store's reputation."

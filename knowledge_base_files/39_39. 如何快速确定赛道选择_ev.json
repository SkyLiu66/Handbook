        "Content": "Selecting the right niche is crucial when creating an IP (Intellectual Property) on platforms like Xiaohongshu. Initially, focus on what you are passionate about rather than just what is profitable. This ensures long-term commitment and authenticity in your content. Popular niches include beauty and skincare, fashion, lifestyle products, and knowledge sharing. However, these niches can be highly competitive. If you lack deep expertise in these areas, consider exploring less saturated niches like pet care, fitness, or digital technology. The key is to choose a niche that you genuinely enjoy and have some level of expertise in. This will make it easier to create engaging and authentic content, which is essential for building a strong IP."

Use your main account to post scenic or aesthetically pleasing content to maintain activity and account health. Posting consistently, even if it's non-commercial content, helps keep your account active and reduces the risk of restrictions. By managing your content strategy effectively, you can maintain a healthy account and continue to grow your presence on the platform."

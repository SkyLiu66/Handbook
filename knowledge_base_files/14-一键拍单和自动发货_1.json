This plugin will handle tasks like synchronizing buyer addresses and initiating purchases. Once the plugin is set up, you can start automating the order process. For example, when you receive an order, the plugin can automatically fill in buyer details and proceed to purchase the item from your supplier. This reduces manual input and speeds up the process. Additionally, you can configure the plugin to add specific notes, such as 'no review cards,' to each order. This ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors. By automating these tasks, you can focus on other aspects of your business, knowing that order processing is handled efficiently."

Paste this link into the plugin's interface to associate it with the corresponding product in your store. This ensures that when an order is placed, the plugin knows where to source the product. Make sure to log in to your supplier accounts to enable seamless order placement. Once linked, the plugin can automatically place orders with the supplier, reducing the time and effort required to manage inventory. This setup not only streamlines the process but also minimizes the risk of errors, ensuring that your customers receive their orders promptly and accurately."

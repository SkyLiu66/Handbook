        "Content": "To improve the customer experience and streamline the feedback process, it is essential to set up a dedicated after-sales support system. Initially, issues were resolved through a lengthy chain of communication, which negatively impacted user satisfaction. To address this, a WeChat account has been designated for after-sales support. This account, managed by a team member, will handle all customer inquiries and issues. It is crucial to inform users about the availability and working hours of this support channel to manage their expectations. By directing users to this dedicated support account, you can focus more on content creation and marketing, ensuring a smoother operation and better user experience."

        "Content": "When setting up promotion codes, there are two critical points to consider. First, once you set a name for your promotion code, do not change it. Consistency is key to avoid confusion in the backend system, which may not be sophisticated enough to track changes accurately. Second, ensure that your QR code is correctly linked to your promotion code. If the QR code is not updated, any sales generated will credit someone else's account, leading to loss of commissions. This step is crucial to ensure that your hard work translates into earnings. Always double-check your promotion links and QR codes to avoid such issues."

First, when registering a new account, choose interests that align with your intended content to streamline the account growth process. Use a single device and avoid using multiple accounts on the same device to prevent issues with the platform's algorithms. During the initial 7-10 days, spend at least 30 minutes daily interacting with content related to your niche. This helps the platform recognize your account as active and genuine. Avoid posting any content during this period to focus on building a solid foundation. Once the account is established, continue to engage with relevant content and gradually start posting. Monitor the account's performance to ensure it aligns with your goals and make adjustments as needed."

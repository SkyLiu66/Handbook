            "Content": "When deciding on the presentation format for your Xiaohongshu posts, consider your strengths and goals. If you excel at real-life photography and want to build a strong personal brand, opt for photo-based posts. However, if you prefer a more lightweight and consistent approach, using poster-style templates might be more suitable. This method allows for easier content creation and can still effectively convey your message. The key is to ensure that your content is engaging and provides value to your audience. Consistently producing high-quality content will help you gain positive feedback and build a loyal following."

            "Content": "When positioning your IP, you can choose between two routes: starting with a product or developing your brand over time. If you already have a product, focus on promoting and monetizing it. If not, build your brand gradually by consistently sharing valuable content. This approach allows you to establish credibility and attract an audience before launching a product. It's crucial to have a clear timeline and allocate your time and energy effectively. For example, you might spend the first three months focusing on content creation and audience building, followed by product development and marketing. By breaking down your goals into manageable steps, you can ensure steady progress and avoid burnout."

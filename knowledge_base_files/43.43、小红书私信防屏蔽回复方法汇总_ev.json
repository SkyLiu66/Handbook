        "Content": "Effective use of direct messaging on Xiaohongshu involves several strategies to ensure your messages are received and acted upon. One method is to include your WeChat ID in the message input box before sending it. You can take a screenshot of this input box and send the image to the recipient. This method increases the likelihood of the recipient receiving your contact information, as Xiaohongshu allows only one image to be sent per day with a high chance of being received. Another approach is to write your WeChat ID on a piece of paper, take a photo, and send this image. Additionally, you can guide users to share their contact information with you by asking them directly. This is particularly useful for older users who may not understand indirect hints. Lastly, you can use a secondary account to post an image with your WeChat ID and share the link to this post with users who inquire about your contact details. Testing these methods with a secondary account can help ensure their effectiveness."

        "Content": "Guiding users to add your Xiaohongshu account can be an effective way to maintain communication. Start by embedding your WeChat ID within your Xiaohongshu account details. Since Xiaohongshu IDs must include letters, you can creatively incorporate your WeChat ID into your Xiaohongshu ID. For example, you can instruct users to add your Xiaohongshu ID by saying, 'Add my Xiaohongshu ID, which includes the numbers from my WeChat ID.' This method ensures that users can easily understand and follow your instructions. Additionally, you can create a post with an image containing your WeChat ID and save it in your favorites. When users ask for your contact information, you can share the link to this post and instruct them to check the image for your WeChat ID. This approach leverages the platform's features to facilitate easy sharing of contact information while adhering to Xiaohongshu's guidelines."

        "Content": "Testing and adapting your messaging strategies is crucial for effective communication on Xiaohongshu. Since the platform has mechanisms to filter out sensitive content, it's important to ensure that your messages are being received. One way to test this is by using a secondary account to send messages to your main account. This allows you to see if the content is being blocked or filtered. If you find that certain messages are not being delivered, you can adjust your approach by changing the wording or method of delivery. For instance, if direct text messages are being blocked, you can try sending images with the necessary information. Additionally, rotating between different messaging methods can help avoid triggering the platform's filters. By continuously testing and adapting your strategies, you can improve the likelihood of your messages being successfully delivered and ensure effective communication with your audience."

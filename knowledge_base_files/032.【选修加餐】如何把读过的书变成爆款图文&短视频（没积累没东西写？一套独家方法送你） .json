Focus on practical, actionable insights that can be easily translated into engaging content. For instance, if the book is about time management, identify key methods or tools mentioned, such as the Eisenhower Matrix or the Pomodoro Technique. Create content around these methods by explaining how they work and providing real-life examples or templates. Use a top-down approach to view the book from a 'God's eye' perspective, identifying sections that can be turned into standalone topics. This method ensures that each piece of content is valuable and relevant to your audience, increasing the likelihood of it becoming a hot topic."

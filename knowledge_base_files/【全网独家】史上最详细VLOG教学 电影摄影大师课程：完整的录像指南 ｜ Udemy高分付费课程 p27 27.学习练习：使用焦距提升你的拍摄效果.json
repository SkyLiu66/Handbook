So let's see, if we first start with focusing on the focal length aspect of our settings, if I zoom in here and change the focal length, we see a little bit of change in the overall depth of field and the overall stylizing of, you know, really picking up on the depth and the texture of this image. So if we zoom back out, we're at 24 frames, let's get our settings right. Let's first start by opening up our aperture from a 9.0 to a 2.8. This is going to give us a much more shallow and stylized depth of field. Now we're going to drop our ISO to something about... ... let's say 1250. Let's say 1250. And we can now see that we're getting a little bit more of a shallow depth of field. We can see that this painting in the foreground is in focus, while this one in the back is out of focus. And now we can come back to this one being in focus. And to accentuate this look even more, we can change our focal length. From a 24 millimeter to something like a 70 millimeter, so that now we really have this cooler style depth of field, right? Where we can really focus in on the depth of this image. This really kind of more textured image compared to this much more flat image of the same exact object. So this is a great example of using our different settings to really try and create a better looking and stylized image of what we're shooting.",

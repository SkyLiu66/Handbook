        "Content": "The first step in building a successful Xiaohongshu account is understanding the four dimensions of earning money. The first dimension is working for others, where most people fall. This includes jobs like high-level executives, delivery workers, and civil servants. In this dimension, you trade your time for money, and your income has a clear ceiling. The second dimension is working for yourself, such as small business owners, brand managers, and online teachers. Here, your income potential is higher because you can sell your time multiple times, like creating a course that sells repeatedly. The third dimension involves hiring others to work for you, like running an MCN company. This allows you to leverage other people's time to generate income. The fourth and highest dimension is making your assets work for you, like an investor. This involves using accumulated assets to generate more wealth with minimal effort. Understanding these dimensions helps you strategize your approach to self-media and maximize your earning potential."

            "self-employment",

        "Content": "Transitioning from being an employee to self-employed is a crucial step in increasing your income potential. As an employee, your income is limited by the hours you can work and the salary your employer is willing to pay. However, when you work for yourself, you can create products or services that can be sold multiple times. For example, creating an online course or writing a book allows you to invest time once and earn repeatedly. This model significantly increases your income potential. Additionally, self-employment allows you to capture the full value of your work, rather than sharing it with an employer. To successfully transition, identify a niche where you can offer unique value and start building your brand. Use platforms like Xiaohongshu to reach a broader audience and establish yourself as an expert in your field. By focusing on self-employment, you can break free from the limitations of traditional employment and achieve greater financial independence."

        "Content": "To achieve higher income levels, it's essential to leverage others' time and assets. This involves moving beyond self-employment to hiring others and investing in assets that generate income. For instance, running an MCN company allows you to sign multiple influencers who generate content and revenue for you. This model scales your income potential because you are not limited by your own time. Additionally, investing in assets like real estate or stocks can provide passive income. The key is to use your initial earnings to build a portfolio of income-generating assets. This approach requires strong management skills and the ability to identify and retain talent. It's also crucial to manage cash flow and invest wisely to ensure long-term growth. By leveraging others' time and assets, you can create a sustainable income stream that grows over time, allowing you to achieve financial freedom and focus on higher-level strategic goals."

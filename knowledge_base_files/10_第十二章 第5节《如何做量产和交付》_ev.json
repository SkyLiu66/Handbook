        "Content": "The delivery process can be divided into three main stages: consultation, pre-sale, and mass production. In the consultation stage, focus on providing consulting services rather than jumping straight into teaching. This allows you to gather user cases and build your knowledge framework without the pressure of preparing extensive materials. The pre-sale stage involves selling your product before it is fully developed. Create a promotional poster and a few initial lessons, then offer the product for sale with a future release date. This helps gauge interest and gather initial feedback. Finally, in the mass production stage, once your product has been validated through pre-sales, focus on producing the full course content and continuously updating it based on platform rules and customer needs."

        "Content": "Structuring your course framework involves several steps. First, analyze similar products and course outlines from competitors. If possible, purchase their products to understand their structure and content. Second, identify user pain points from consultation cases, sales processes, and comments on your posts. These pain points can help you tailor your course content to address common issues. Third, refer to professional books and their tables of contents to build a comprehensive course framework. For example, if you are creating an English learning course for children, look at popular books on the subject and incorporate their methods and topics into your course. By combining insights from competitors, user feedback, and professional literature, you can create a robust and effective course framework."

        ],
        "Content": "Iterative course development is crucial for continuously improving your course content. Start with a basic framework and gradually enhance it based on user feedback and new insights. During the development process, be open to making changes and updates. For example, if you notice that certain topics are more important to users, allocate more time to cover them in detail. Conversely, if some content is less relevant, consider reducing its emphasis. Use various sources of information, such as competitor analysis, user comments, and professional literature, to refine your course. Remember that the goal is to deliver the most valuable content to your users, even if it means making adjustments along the way. By adopting an iterative approach, you can ensure that your course remains relevant and effective."

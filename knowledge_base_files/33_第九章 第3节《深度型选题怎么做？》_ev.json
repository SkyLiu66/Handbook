Second, join relevant groups and communities, such as WeChat groups, to observe discussions and identify recurring themes. Third, use platforms like Zhihu to search for high-voted questions related to your topic.

This type of content is crucial when users are in the decision-making phase of their purchase journey. To create effective selling point content, start by researching user reviews and comments on platforms like Xiaohongshu, Taobao, and Zhihu. Identify common questions and concerns related to your product category. For example, if you are promoting washing machines, users might ask about differences between budget and premium models, or specific features like energy efficiency. Use these insights to create content that addresses these questions directly. Additionally, consider creating comparison guides, product reviews, and how-to articles that showcase your product's advantages. By focusing on the aspects that matter most to potential buyers, you can influence their purchasing decisions and build trust in your brand."

        "Content": "Structuring series-based content involves creating a cohesive and continuous flow of information that covers a topic comprehensively. This approach helps in establishing a framework that guides your audience through a learning journey. To develop series-based content, start by identifying key themes and subtopics within your niche. Use resources like books, courses, and professional accounts as references. For instance, if you are creating content on prenatal care, you might structure your series around stages such as preconception, pregnancy, and postnatal care. Each stage can be broken down into specific topics like nutrition, exercise, and mental health. Similarly, if you are focusing on a skill like yoga, you can create a series that covers different levels of practice, from beginner to advanced. By organizing your content into a series, you provide your audience with a clear and logical progression of information, making it easier for them to follow and engage with your content."

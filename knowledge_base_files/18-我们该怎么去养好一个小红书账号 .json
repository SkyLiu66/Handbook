        "Content": "Warming up your Xiaohongshu account is crucial for increasing its weight and visibility. Accounts that undergo a warm-up period tend to have higher weight, making it easier for their posts to gain traction. Without warming up, your account might have lower weight or be more sensitive, resulting in less traffic and visibility for your posts. The warm-up process typically takes about two to three days. During this period, engage with the platform in a way that mimics a real user. This includes browsing, liking, and commenting on posts related to your niche. For example, if your niche is women's fashion, search for and interact with posts in that category. This activity signals to the platform that your account is genuine and active, thereby increasing its weight. A well-warmed account is more likely to have its posts seen by a larger audience, which is essential for gaining followers and engagement."

        "Content": "Maintaining a standard physical environment is essential when warming up your Xiaohongshu account. This involves using one device per account to avoid detection and potential penalties. Xiaohongshu is sensitive to account activity and can detect when multiple accounts are being managed from a single device, especially if third-party apps are used. For instance, if you have an Android phone with a built-in dual app feature, you can manage two Xiaohongshu accounts on one device. However, avoid using third-party apps to create multiple instances as these are easily detected and can lead to account suspension. Additionally, limit the number of accounts connected to a single network to three. If you are using mobile data, ensure each device has its own SIM card and data plan. This practice helps in maintaining the integrity of your accounts and prevents them from being flagged as suspicious."

        "Content": "To successfully warm up your Xiaohongshu account, follow a structured approach over two to three days. Start by searching for and interacting with posts in your niche. For example, if you are in the women's fashion niche, search for related keywords like 'women's clothing' or 'spring outfits.' Engage with these posts by browsing, liking, and commenting. This activity should be done in three steps: browsing, liking, and commenting. Browsing involves simply viewing the posts, liking involves giving a thumbs-up to posts you find interesting, and commenting can be as simple as leaving an emoji or a short message. Repeat this process for different keywords within your niche. The goal is to make your account appear active and engaged. After a few days, check your account's 'Discover' section. If 80% of the recommended content aligns with your niche, your warm-up process has been successful. Spend about 30 minutes to an hour each day on this activity to ensure your account gains the necessary weight for better visibility."

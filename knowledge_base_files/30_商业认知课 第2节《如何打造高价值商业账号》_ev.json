        "Content": "Your pricing as an influencer should generally be 10% to 20% of your follower count. If you have had several viral posts recently, you can consider pricing higher than 20%. Additionally, you can refer to the pricing of influencers with similar follower counts on platforms like Qianhua Data. To find this information, you can purchase a day or week pass on Taobao and check the pricing of similar influencers. A lower cost per impression (CPI) increases your account's value and makes you more attractive to advertisers. By understanding the market rates and adjusting your pricing accordingly, you can set competitive and fair prices for your services."

        "Content": "To create high-value content that attracts advertisers, focus on producing content that naturally integrates advertisements. Start with a topic that is already popular and then incorporate the advertisement into it. For example, if you are creating content about newborn care, you can seamlessly introduce a product like a baby lotion within the context of your post. This approach ensures that the advertisement feels organic and not forced. Additionally, place the advertisement later in the content to keep the audience engaged. Advertisers are more likely to invest in content that already performs well organically. By creating content that is both engaging and subtly promotional, you can attract more advertising opportunities and maintain high engagement rates."

This increases the likelihood of your post performing well. Second, ensure that the natural data of your post is good before adding paid promotions. Advertisers are more likely to invest in posts that already show strong organic performance. Third, place the advertisement later in the content to avoid early drop-offs from viewers. This keeps the audience engaged and increases the chances of them interacting with the advertisement. By following these strategies, you can create commercial posts that not only attract advertisers but also maintain high engagement rates, making your account more valuable."

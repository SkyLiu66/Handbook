        "Content": "To avoid content violations on Xiaohongshu, it is crucial to understand and adhere to the platform's guidelines. Violations often occur due to unapproved promotions, inducement to share, data falsification, and inappropriate content. Unapproved promotions, where the brand does not follow the required reporting procedures, are frequently flagged. Xiaohongshu has tightened its regulations, making it essential for brands to report their promotional activities properly. Inducement to share, such as using giveaways to boost interaction, is strictly prohibited. Brands must avoid tactics like asking for likes, comments, or shares in exchange for rewards. Data falsification, including artificially inflating interaction metrics, is monitored closely. Accounts found guilty of this can be blacklisted or banned. Lastly, content that includes sensitive words or images, or that plagiarizes other posts, will be restricted or removed. Brands should ensure their content is original, complies with community standards, and avoids sensitive topics."

        "Content": "If your post on Xiaohongshu is limited in reach, there are strategies to address this issue. First, identify the reason for the limitation. If it is due to content violations, rectify the content by removing any sensitive words or images and ensuring compliance with community guidelines. For posts that are not inherently problematic but still face limited reach, consider revising the content to make it more engaging and aligned with user interests. Adding high-quality images, using relevant hashtags, and ensuring the post is informative and valuable can help. Additionally, engaging with your audience through comments and interactions can boost visibility. If the post is promotional, ensure it is reported correctly and follows all promotional guidelines. In cases where the post is beyond saving, creating new content that adheres to all guidelines and incorporates lessons learned from the limited reach post can be a more effective approach."

        "Content": "Creating high-quality posts on Xiaohongshu involves several key elements. First, focus on the visual appeal of your post. High-quality, clear images are essential, but they should not look overly professional or staged. Authentic, user-generated style photos tend to perform better. Aim for a mix of product images and lifestyle shots that show the product in use. Second, the text content should be engaging and informative. While it is important to provide detailed information about the product, the tone should be conversational and relatable. Posts should be between 500 to 800 words, with a mix of text and emojis to enhance readability. Third, avoid hard-selling tactics. Instead, frame the post as a personal experience or review. This approach aligns with the platform's community-driven nature and is more likely to resonate with users. Lastly, ensure your post complies with all Xiaohongshu guidelines to avoid any restrictions or bans."

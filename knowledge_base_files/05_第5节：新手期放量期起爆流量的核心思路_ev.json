            "Content": "Hello everyone, let's continue from where we left off in the last session. Today, we will discuss the core content of preparing for account growth. The process of growing an account involves three stages: the learning phase, the scaling phase, and the stabilization phase. In the learning phase, the platform knows nothing about you, so you need to feed it data to let it know what kind of audience you want and what products you are selling. This phase is challenging, and many businesses get stuck here. The scaling phase occurs when your account starts gaining traction, and you need to use paid methods to stabilize your growth. Finally, the stabilization phase is when your account has a large audience, and you need to maintain your metrics to keep growing. Each stage requires specific actions to ensure successful account growth."

            "Content": "In the learning phase, the platform is trying to understand what kind of audience you want and what products you are selling. This phase typically involves the first one to three live sessions. During this time, you need to focus on building trust with the platform by providing data on user retention and interaction. The goal is to show the platform that you are a reliable seller with a clear target audience. The traffic during this phase is usually between zero to thirty concurrent viewers. To succeed, you need to focus on retention and interaction metrics. These metrics help the platform understand your target audience and start pushing your content to the right people. Avoid focusing too much on conversions at this stage; instead, aim to build a solid foundation of user engagement."

            "Content": "Once you move past the learning phase, you enter the scaling phase, where your account starts gaining more traction. During this phase, your concurrent viewers may increase to 200-500. The focus should shift to optimizing conversion rates and user value (UV). Use paid methods to attract high-value customers and sell higher-priced products. This helps the platform understand that your account can handle both low and high-priced items, leading to better audience targeting. In the stabilization phase, where you have over 500 concurrent viewers, the focus should be on maintaining high conversion rates and user engagement. Continue using paid methods to attract new customers and keep your existing audience engaged. By optimizing each phase, you can ensure steady and sustainable account growth."

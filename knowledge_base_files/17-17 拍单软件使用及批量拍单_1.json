        "Content": "Choosing the right software for bulk shipping depends on your order volume and budget. Yitao is a cost-effective option for those starting with fewer orders, typically under 20 per day. It offers basic functionalities and is easier to set up. However, it may send SMS notifications to buyers, which cannot be intercepted. On the other hand, Jintun is more suitable for larger stores with higher order volumes. It offers advanced features and better integration but comes at a higher cost. Most large stores prefer Jintun due to its reliability and comprehensive features. When selecting software, consider your current needs and future growth. Start with Yitao if you are new and upgrade to Jintun as your business scales. Both options provide tutorials and customer support to help you get started. By choosing the right software, you can streamline your shipping process and focus on growing your business."

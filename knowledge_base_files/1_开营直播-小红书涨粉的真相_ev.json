        "Content": "Xiaohongshu has one of the most stringent content approval and moderation processes among social media platforms. The platform employs a multi-layered review system that includes both automated and manual checks. When a video is uploaded, it undergoes an initial review where the title, description, and thumbnail are scrutinized. Following this, the video content itself is analyzed frame by frame, with text and images extracted and checked against a database of prohibited terms and content. This rigorous process ensures that only content aligning with Xiaohongshu's community standards is published. Creators often find that their videos might appear to be published but receive no views, indicating that the content is still under review or has been restricted. To navigate this, creators can share their videos via external links to check if they are viewable. This strict moderation ensures that Xiaohongshu maintains a high standard of content quality and community safety, but it also means that creators must be diligent in adhering to the platform's guidelines to avoid content restrictions."

This is one of my favorite topics because this is like one of the coolest things as a filmmaker is knowing how to consciously move the camera. Okay, so we're going to get into how to use camera movement. I'm going to overview the different types of camera movement and I want you guys to keep in mind what resonates with you the most out of these main different types of movement. What resonates with you the most as in like what you like, what gets you excited, and then also what you can use for your video that you're creating during this course. So the main types of camera movement. Overall, the main types are a push-in, pull-out, tracking shot, arc shot, crane, tilt, and pan. And so to get more specific, the first one is a push-in, which is moving the camera. Closer, going into and showing importance in your scene. When we physically move the camera closer, we're bringing the audience closer to what they're seeing, creating the sense of, you know, it's a sense of like awe, a sense of wonder, a sense of wanting to know more, a sense of coming closer to the information, a sense of expanding what is being seen, right? This is kind of like more on the metaphor theoretical side, but this is the feeling. This is the feeling that the viewer is going to feel. So if we do the opposite and we do a pull-out movement, what we're doing is moving the camera away. We're leaving the scene. We're ending a thought. We're really concluding something by moving back. Like if I'm leaving you right now, it's a different feeling than if I'm coming in and saying something that's of very importance, right? So I think that's making sense for you. The next kind of shot is a tracking shot. This is when we're moving with our subject, right? This is when we're moving through a scene. The camera movement is matching our character's movement. So the subject feels on the same page with the viewer and the viewer feels on the same page of the subject because the subject, the viewer's eye, which is the camera, is moving along with what is being seen, right? So it feels like we're moving through a scene when we do a tracking shot. The other thing to think about with that is without being too theoretical, I don't know, this part is very juicy for me. So I like to dive into like more of the invisible understandings of these things. But what's happening is with the tracking shot, you're moving with the subject. And so the subject is staying in the same part of the frame, but the background is shifting. So that's a very unique perspective for the camera to have. Generally, the subject is here and the camera is moving like this or this or this. But a tracking shot is kind of like a mirror. It's like a mirror that's moving together collectively. So that creates a certain type of resonance where, yeah, like the character is staying the same, but the background is changing. And you can use that feeling very uniquely in different scenarios. Next is the arc shot. This is when we orbit around our subject, kind of like the way that our sun orbits, I know, our Earth orbits around the sun, where the subject stays fixed and we move around. So this is a cool parallax feeling where the subject is staying the same, similar to, relatively the same, similar to a tracking shot, but the backgrounds have a very dramatic shift. So this is a very cool style for very dramatic scenes when you want to keep your subject in the same focal point of interest. Next up is a crane shot. This is where we're moving vertically up or down. And this is perfect for a power change or a shift. In the scene, if I were to move this camera up or down, it would create a shift in perspective of where I am feeling, where I am looking, where I am in relation to the camera. And that shift creates a certain a change in dominance, I want to say, but also a change in power between the perspective of the camera and the perspective of the subject. And when you change the perspective of the camera, if you go above and you're looking down on the subject, The viewer is seeing through the camera and is going to feel a different sensation than looking up to the camera. It's very different, right? Next up is a tilt and this is angling the camera itself up or down. This is great for reveal shots or showing the size or proportion of something. You're simply tilting the angle of view up or down. So it's similar to a crane shot but without physically moving the camera up and down. You're changing the view of the camera where it's looking in perspective to what it's looking at, right? So if I tilt the camera down, whatever's in front of that camera, I'm going to be looking down upon. If I tilt the camera up, whatever the camera's looking at, I'm going to be looking up upon. It's a very different feeling and emotional response for whoever is looking at that imagery. And the final type of camera movement is a pan. And this is angling. It's angling the camera left and right. It's kind of a way to softly go through a scene or follow change that's happening in front of the camera. I know that these are a little bit more on the principle theoretical side of filmmaking, but I do believe it's very important for you as a video creator to be able to bring this higher understanding of really the knowledge of filmmaking into your more inner, more personal, more personal experience.",

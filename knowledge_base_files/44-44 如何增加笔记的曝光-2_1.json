These coupons provide additional exposure to your posts, helping them reach a wider audience. To access these rewards, navigate to the 'Growth Boost' section in the 'Creator Center.' Regularly check this section to see if you have any available coupons and use them promptly. It's important to apply these coupons to posts that already have a high engagement rate, as they are more likely to benefit from the additional exposure. Avoid using coupons on low-performing posts, as they may not yield significant results. Additionally, use the coupons before their expiration date to ensure they are effective. By strategically using growth boost features, you can enhance the visibility of your content and attract more followers."

        "Content": "Sharing your posts and tagging relevant official accounts can significantly increase their exposure on Xiaohongshu. After publishing a post, share it on other social media platforms like WeChat or in your WeChat Moments to reach a broader audience. Xiaohongshu encourages users to share their content externally, which can lead to additional views and engagement. Additionally, tagging official accounts related to your content can attract their attention and potentially earn you a feature or shoutout. For example, if you post about daily household items, tag the 'Daily Life' official account. While tagging does not guarantee increased exposure, it is a simple and low-effort action that can yield positive results. By consistently sharing your posts and tagging relevant accounts, you can enhance your content's visibility and reach a larger audience."

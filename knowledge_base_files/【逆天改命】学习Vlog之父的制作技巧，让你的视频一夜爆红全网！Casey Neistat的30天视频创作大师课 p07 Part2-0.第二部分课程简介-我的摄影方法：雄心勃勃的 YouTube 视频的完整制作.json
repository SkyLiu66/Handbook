Filmmaking from a more holistic perspective. Bigger, more ambitious stories. Transitional shot, center of frame. This shot's the dream. The interestingness can come from the insanity of this cinematography. I think about what role the shots could play in the narrative. This movie is about every step of the process for me. The edit is this pile of clay, and I'm trying to turn it into a beautiful sculpture. That is movie-making magic. Continue that momentum and engage them and get them to want to come along for the ride.",

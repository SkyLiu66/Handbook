        "Content": "On Xiaohongshu, the cover image of a post is crucial as it significantly influences whether users will click on your content. The platform displays posts in a dual-column waterfall format, making the cover image the first thing users see. Therefore, it is essential to use clear, high-quality images that are not overly commercialized. Instead of using product images, opt for real-life photos that appear more authentic and relatable. The cover image should occupy 80% of the user's attention, followed by the title. A compelling cover image can dramatically increase the likelihood of users engaging with your post. To create effective cover images, study successful accounts and their popular posts. Analyze their cover images and titles to understand what works. Remember, the cover image should be in a 3:4 ratio, and it is beneficial to experiment with different images to find what resonates best with your audience."

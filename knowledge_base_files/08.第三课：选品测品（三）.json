        "Content": "The root method is a widely used product selection strategy that involves identifying and using specific keywords, referred to as 'roots,' to find potential products. The process begins by determining a root keyword, such as 'blue shirt' or 'striped blue shirt.' Once the root keyword is identified, it is used to search on platforms like Xiaohongshu to review related notes and products. If the product meets the selection criteria, the next step is to source the product from suppliers on platforms like Taobao, 1688, or Pinduoduo. The root method involves three main steps: identifying the root keyword, verifying the keyword's popularity and relevance using tools like Taobao's search data, and finally sourcing the product from reliable suppliers. This method ensures that the selected products have a high potential for success based on data-driven insights."

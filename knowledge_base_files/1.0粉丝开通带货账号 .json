        "Content": "To open a shop window on Douyin with zero followers, follow these steps: First, open the Douyin app and click on the three horizontal lines in the top right corner. Select 'Creator Center' and then click on the account at the top. Next, click on 'Real-name Authentication.' If you haven't completed this step, do so now, as it must match the person linked to your payment account. Follow the prompts to complete the authentication. Once authenticated, return to the 'Creator Service Center' and click on 'All Functions.' Scroll down to find 'E-commerce with Goods,' which will be greyed out if not activated. Click 'Join Douyin E-commerce,' agree to the authorization, and select 'Individual' using your ID card. Upload the front and back of your ID and fill in the required phone number and email. Submit the information and wait for the review, which takes 1-3 days. After approval, return to the 'Creator Service Center' and find the activated e-commerce function. Note that without 1,000 followers and a deposit, you can only use the shop window feature. Once you meet the follower requirement, you can explore other options like video or live-streaming sales."

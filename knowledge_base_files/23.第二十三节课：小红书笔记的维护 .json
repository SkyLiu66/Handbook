        "Content": "Guiding customers to place orders is a crucial aspect of maintaining your notes. After your post gains traction, you should actively engage in the comments section to direct potential buyers. You can comment on your own post, suggesting that viewers click the purchase link or the link at the bottom left of the video. Additionally, you can use secondary accounts to comment, simulating customer feedback. For instance, ask a friend to comment from a different WiFi and location, saying they have purchased the product. This creates a sense of trust and urgency among other viewers. By strategically managing the comments, you can effectively guide more customers to place orders, thereby increasing your sales."

If someone leaves a negative comment, you have the option to delete it by long-pressing the comment. Additionally, you can block the user by clicking on their profile and selecting the block option. This prevents further negative interactions from the same user. It's important to act quickly to remove any negative comments to ensure that potential customers see only positive feedback. By maintaining a clean and positive comment section, you can enhance the credibility of your product and encourage more customers to make a purchase."

        "Content": "Reposting successful notes is a strategy to maintain and increase the visibility of your popular posts. If a particular post or video gains popularity, you should repost it multiple times a day. While reposting, make minor adjustments to the text order or punctuation to avoid duplication issues. Keep the content, images, and titles largely the same to maintain consistency. This approach ensures that your successful content continues to reach a wider audience, thereby driving more traffic and potential sales. By consistently reposting your popular notes, you can maximize their impact and maintain a steady flow of engagement."

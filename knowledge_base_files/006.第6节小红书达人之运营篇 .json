        "Content": "Ensuring compliance with Xiaohongshu's advertising guidelines is crucial to maintaining your account's health and avoiding penalties. First, always use the Pu Gong Ying platform for advertising deals to avoid 'private orders,' which can lead to account violations. Avoid engaging in practices like buying followers or using bots to inflate your account metrics, as these can be detected and result in penalties. Additionally, be cautious about the types of advertisements you accept. Avoid ads related to sensitive topics such as medical treatments, weight loss products, or any content that might be considered misleading or exaggerated. Always review the advertiser's product and reputation to ensure there are no significant negative reviews or controversies. If an advertiser asks you to modify the ad content multiple times, it might be a red flag indicating potential issues. Finally, maintain a reasonable pricing strategy for your ads based on your account's metrics and avoid frequent price changes, as this can also affect your account's credibility."

First, choose a niche that is popular and has high advertising demand, such as beauty, fashion, or lifestyle. Ensure your account metrics, such as engagement rates and follower growth, are strong, as advertisers look for accounts with high interaction rates. Regularly update your content to keep your audience engaged and attract more advertising opportunities. Additionally, be proactive in seeking out advertising deals by reaching out to potential advertisers and participating in relevant advertising campaigns. Utilize multiple accounts if possible to increase your reach and revenue potential. When setting your advertising rates, consider factors such as your niche, follower demographics, and engagement metrics.

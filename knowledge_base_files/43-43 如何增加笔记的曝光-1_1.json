        "Content": "One effective way to increase the exposure of your posts on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu is by participating in platform activities. These activities are often promoted through notifications in the app, such as topic events or inspiration prompts. For example, the platform might push a topic like 'Which celebrity is active today?' If your product or content can be related to this topic, you can leverage the event's traffic by sharing relevant posts. Regularly checking the 'Inspiration' section in the 'Creation Center' can also provide ideas for content that aligns with trending topics. If you find a suitable topic but are not ready to post immediately, you can save it for later. Engaging in these activities not only increases your visibility but also aligns your content with the platform's current trends, making it more likely to be promoted by the platform."

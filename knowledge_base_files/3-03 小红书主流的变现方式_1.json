        "Content": "One of the primary monetization methods on Xiaohongshu is through advertising. Many influencers on the platform earn money by accepting advertisements. Xiaohongshu has an official platform called Pugongying for handling ad deals. However, this method has high entry requirements. Firstly, you need to have at least 1,000 followers. Secondly, you must possess professional knowledge in a specific niche, along with strong content creation skills, including video production and editing. Due to these stringent requirements, this path is not recommended for beginners or those without prior experience in social media. The process of building a substantial following and developing the necessary skills can be time-consuming, making it a less accessible option for immediate monetization."

The platform has recently started promoting live streaming by inviting influential personalities to host live sessions. Additionally, Xiaohongshu has introduced the 'Buyer Era,' which focuses on live streaming as a means of selling products. However, live streaming on Xiaohongshu is not as mature as on platforms like Douyin. It also has a high entry barrier, requiring at least 1,000 followers and significant live streaming skills. Due to these challenges, live streaming is not the most suitable option for beginners. It demands a high level of engagement and the ability to entertain and persuade viewers in real-time, which can be daunting for those new to the platform."

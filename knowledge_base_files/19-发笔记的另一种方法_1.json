Once you find a suitable product, download the main images and detailed images. Ensure that the images are clear and high-resolution. If the images are not clear, use software like Wink to enhance the image quality. Additionally, you can search for images on Taobao, but be cautious of watermarks or store names on the images. After gathering all the necessary images, organize them according to the product specifications you plan to sell. For example, if you are selling a specific color or size, only upload images that match those specifications. This ensures that your product listings are accurate and appealing to potential buyers."

Start by clearly defining the specifications of the products you are selling, such as size, color, and weight. Ensure that these specifications are accurately reflected in the product images and descriptions. When setting prices, consider your cost price and desired profit margin. It is advisable to set a slightly higher price initially to allow room for discounts and coupons. For example, if your cost price is 60, you might set the selling price at 99 and offer a 10 discount coupon, making the final price 89. This strategy not only attracts buyers but also ensures you maintain a healthy profit margin. Additionally, configure your logistics and shipping settings accurately to avoid any issues with order fulfillment. By carefully managing product specifications and pricing, you can enhance the overall shopping experience for your customers and increase sales."

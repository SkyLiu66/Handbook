        "Content": "To effectively select products on Xiaohongshu, you can utilize the merchant backend after setting up your Xiaohongshu store. The backend provides access to various tools, including the 'Notes' section and the 'Community Hot Searches.' These tools allow you to identify trending topics and products with high search volumes. Start by exploring the hot search pool, which contains numerous high-traffic keywords. Next, choose your specific niche from the available categories, such as 3C digital products, health supplements, or essential oils. It's recommended to focus on the 'Community Hottest' and 'Hot Searches' categories rather than the 'Most Lacking Notes,' as the latter may indicate a niche with fewer active users. By following these steps, you can identify popular products and incorporate relevant keywords into your titles and descriptions to attract more attention."

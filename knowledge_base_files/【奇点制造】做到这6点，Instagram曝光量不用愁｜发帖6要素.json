    "Content": "To increase your Instagram exposure, focus on boosting post engagement. Engagement is calculated by the number of likes and comments divided by the average number of followers, typically around 2%. Lengthening your post content and incorporating storytelling can make users spend more time on your posts, enhancing their value. Using appropriate hashtags acts as keywords, increasing your post's visibility. Implementing a Call to Action (CTA) can prompt users to interact more, such as asking for likes or comments. Lastly, posting at times when your followers are most active can optimize interaction and engagement."

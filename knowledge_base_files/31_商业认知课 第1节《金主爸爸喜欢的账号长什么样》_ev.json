        "Content": "Interaction data is a critical factor in determining the value of your account to advertisers. This includes likes, comments, and shares on your posts. Advertisers assess recent interaction data to gauge the current engagement level of your account. Consistent and high engagement rates indicate that your content resonates well with your audience, making your account more attractive for advertising. Accounts with fluctuating or low engagement rates are less appealing because they suggest instability in content quality. To maintain high engagement, focus on creating content that encourages interaction and regularly review your analytics to understand what works best with your audience. This approach not only helps in retaining your audience but also makes your account more appealing to advertisers."

        "Content": "Setting the right price for your advertising services is essential. Your pricing should reflect the quality and engagement level of your account. A common method is to set your price at 10% to 20% of your follower count. For example, if you have 10,000 followers, your price range should be between 1,000 to 2,000 units. Additionally, consider using the Cost Per Engagement (CPE) metric, which is calculated by dividing your average engagement over the last 180 days by your price. A lower CPE indicates a better value for advertisers, making your account more competitive. Regularly review and adjust your pricing based on your engagement data and market trends to ensure you remain attractive to potential advertisers."

For example, if you are selling bags, spend time each day engaging with posts about bags. This activity helps the algorithm understand your interests, making it more likely to show you relevant content. A well-nurtured account will display a majority of posts related to your niche, indicating successful nurturing. This process not only helps in building a healthy account but also enhances your sensitivity to industry trends. For new accounts, dedicating about 30 minutes daily for a couple of days is usually sufficient. For older accounts, consistency in engagement is key.

To find these stores, search for relevant keywords on Xiaohongshu and look for accounts with high engagement and sales figures. For instance, if you are selling bags, look for stores with sales ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand units. Avoid stores with extremely high sales, as their strategies may be harder to replicate. Once you identify these stores, follow them and analyze their posts, products, and customer interactions. This information can help you understand what works well in your niche and guide your own product selection and marketing strategies. Aim to identify at least ten benchmark stores, but more is better. Regularly updating your list of benchmark stores will keep you informed about market trends and competitive strategies."

Start by identifying products with moderate sales figures, as these are easier to compete with. For example, look for products with sales between 100 and 1,000 units. Avoid products with extremely high sales, as they are more challenging to follow. Once you find a suitable product, save and analyze its content, including images, descriptions, and engagement metrics. Use this information to create similar content for your own products. Ensure that you modify the content to avoid direct copying, which can lead to issues with platform policies. Instead, focus on creating unique and engaging content that resonates with your audience. Regularly monitor the performance of your posts and adjust your strategy based on what works best. By effectively following successful products, you can improve your chances of achieving higher sales and better engagement."

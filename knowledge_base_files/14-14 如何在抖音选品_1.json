        "Content": "When selecting products on Douyin, it's important to consider a few key factors. Firstly, Douyin is known for higher-priced items compared to other platforms like Taobao or Pinduoduo. This makes it suitable for those looking to sell high-ticket items. Secondly, Douyin aggregates high-quality content from creators across the internet, making it a great source for finding quality product materials. To start, use the search function on Douyin to find relevant products. Avoid accounts with millions of followers as they may not provide practical insights for smaller sellers. Instead, focus on accounts with a moderate following, around 10,000 to 200,000 followers. Analyze their content, product types, and presentation styles. Ensure the products are not already being sold on other platforms like Xiaohongshu to avoid redundancy. By carefully selecting and analyzing these accounts, you can find products that are likely to perform well on Douyin."

        "Content": "Douyin Mall is another effective tool for identifying trending products. When you search within Douyin, you can access the 'Mall' section, which showcases products that are currently gaining popularity. This feature allows you to see what items are trending and potentially capitalize on these trends. For example, if you are in the home goods niche, you might find that a particular type of hanging washbasin is trending. You can then investigate the product further to see if it meets your selection criteria and if you can source it. Avoid branded items to prevent issues with brand restrictions. By leveraging Douyin Mall, you can stay updated on the latest trends and incorporate popular products into your inventory, increasing your chances of success."

        "Content": "Douyin's Selected Alliance is a premium feature that requires you to have a certain number of followers and pay a deposit. Specifically, you need to have at least 1,000 followers and pay a 500 RMB deposit to access this feature. The Selected Alliance provides access to a curated list of products that are recommended for selling on Douyin. This feature can be particularly useful for those who have already established a presence on the platform and are looking to expand their product offerings. If you do not have access to the Selected Alliance, you can still use other methods like account-based product selection and Douyin Mall trends to find suitable products. However, if you meet the criteria, the Selected Alliance can be a valuable resource for discovering high-potential products and gaining a competitive edge."

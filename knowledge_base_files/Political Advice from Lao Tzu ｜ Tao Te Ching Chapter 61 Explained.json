        "Content": "The article discusses the concept of humility and the power that comes from taking a lower position. It explores how this principle can be applied to both large countries and small countries in international politics, as well as to individuals in their personal lives. The author emphasizes that while all people are equally valuable, they are not equal in terms of individual characteristics and skills. The key is to recognize and embrace one's unique abilities and perform them to the best of one's abilities, rather than comparing oneself to others. This approach fosters personal growth and contentment, leading to a more fulfilling life."

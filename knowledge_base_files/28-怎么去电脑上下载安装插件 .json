Start by accessing the browser's extension management page, usually found in the top-right corner under 'Manage Extensions.' Here, you can see all installed plugins and their statuses. If a plugin is not working correctly, try disabling and re-enabling it. To do this, click on the toggle switch next to the plugin's name. If the issue persists, remove the plugin by clicking the 'Remove' button and then reinstall it. Ensure your browser is up-to-date, as outdated browsers can cause compatibility issues with plugins. Additionally, check for any updates available for the plugin itself. If you encounter specific errors, refer to the plugin's support documentation or contact their customer support for assistance. Proper management and troubleshooting ensure that your plugins remain functional and efficient."

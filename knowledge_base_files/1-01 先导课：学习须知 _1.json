The courses are designed to take you from a beginner to a proficient user, covering 80% to 90% of the necessary knowledge.

The second viewing should be more focused, addressing specific questions and details. This thorough preparation ensures that you are not confused during the practical implementation phase. After completing the courses, you can join the support group to inform the instructor and proceed with hands-on practice.

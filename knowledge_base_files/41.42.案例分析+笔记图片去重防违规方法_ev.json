        "Content": "Effective use of visual content is crucial for attracting and engaging an audience. The first step is to create an eye-catching cover image. For instance, a cover image that highlights the product's features, such as a bra showing its gathering effect, can draw immediate attention. The color scheme and overall aesthetics should be appealing. Each subsequent image should showcase different aspects of the product, like comfort, softness, and fit. For example, images can demonstrate how the bra fits both small and large busts, emphasizing its versatility. Highlighting features like 'soft padding' or 'no underwire' can further attract potential buyers. The key is to ensure that each image communicates a specific benefit, making the product more desirable. By strategically using visual content, you can significantly enhance user engagement and conversion rates."

        "Content": "Creating unique content through image editing is essential to stand out and avoid plagiarism issues. Tools like Meitu Xiuxiu can be used to modify images effectively. Start by removing any watermarks using the crop or mosaic tool. Adjust the brightness, contrast, and saturation to alter the image's appearance subtly. For instance, increasing the brightness slightly can make the image look more appealing without overexposing it. Additionally, use the 'sharpen' feature to enhance the image's clarity. Adding stickers and text can further personalize the image. Ensure that these elements are subtle, with transparency settings adjusted to around 1% to avoid detection by automated systems. By following these steps, you can create visually appealing and unique content that stands out on platforms like Xiaohongshu."

Adjust the transparency of the text to around 1% to ensure it blends seamlessly with the image. By incorporating stickers and text, you can create more engaging and visually appealing content that captures the audience's attention."

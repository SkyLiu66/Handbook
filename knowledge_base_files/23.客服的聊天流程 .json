        "Content": "In e-commerce, responding to customer inquiries promptly is crucial. The customer service response process involves setting up and managing both official and self-managed customer service channels. Official customer service may incur costs and is not recommended for small-scale operations with fewer orders. Instead, self-managed customer service allows you to handle inquiries personally. The key metrics to monitor are the 24-hour response rate, which should be above 85%, and the three-minute response rate, which, while less critical, can impact your store's reputation. To facilitate timely responses, you can download the Xiaohongshu merchant app, which allows you to reply to customer messages directly from your phone. Ensure that notifications are enabled so you can respond promptly. This setup helps maintain high customer satisfaction and improves your store's performance."

        "Content": "Automated responses can significantly enhance your customer service efficiency. In the Xiaohongshu backend, you can set up automated tools to handle common inquiries. This includes configuring welcome messages for both working and non-working hours. Additionally, you can set up keyword-based automatic replies. For example, if a customer asks, 'When will my order ship?' you can configure the system to automatically respond with 'Your order will ship within 48 hours.' To set this up, go to the customer service settings, enable the automated response tool, and add relevant keywords and responses. Ensure that the automated responses are accurate and helpful to maintain customer satisfaction. Automated responses help manage customer expectations and reduce the workload on your customer service team."

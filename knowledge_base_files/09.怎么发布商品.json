The title should include relevant keywords that potential customers are likely to search for. For example, if you are selling a 'black dress,' ensure that 'black dress' is included in the title. You can research successful competitors' titles by sorting products by sales and copying their structure, as these titles have been optimized for search. While Xiaohongshu does not have a dedicated tool for keyword research, using high-ranking competitors' titles can help you identify important keywords. Remember, the title should be concise yet descriptive, ideally within 30 characters, to ensure it appears in search results and attracts clicks."

High-quality, visually appealing images can greatly enhance your product's conversion rate.

Avoid using images with watermarks or those that look unprofessional. Additionally, you can use tools like Meitu Xiuxiu to adjust the image dimensions to fit Xiaohongshu's requirements. Aim to upload the maximum number of images allowed, typically around 10, to provide a comprehensive view of the product. This thorough visual representation helps build trust and encourages purchases."

        "Content": "Setting competitive prices and managing inventory effectively are key to attracting and retaining customers. Start by researching your competitors' prices for similar products. If a competitor is selling a product for 89 yuan, consider pricing yours slightly lower, such as 87 or 86 yuan, to attract price-sensitive customers. Ensure your pricing strategy reflects the value and quality of your product while remaining competitive. For inventory, maintain a balance to avoid stockouts or overstocking. Regularly update your inventory levels and set realistic stock quantities based on demand forecasts. Efficient inventory management ensures that you can meet customer demand promptly, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty."

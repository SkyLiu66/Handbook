        "Content": "Before considering the opening of multiple stores, it is essential to ensure that your initial store is well-managed and profitable. Attempting to expand without a stable foundation can lead to the failure of all stores. The first condition is to achieve consistent sales and profitability in your first store. Only after mastering the operations, processes, and methods of running a single store should you consider expanding. Additionally, you need to have ample free time to manage multiple stores, as the time required increases significantly with each additional store. Properly managing one store is crucial before scaling up to ensure sustainable growth and success."

        "Content": "To open multiple stores, follow a structured process. First, register new accounts using real names and business licenses. You can use family members' information to create additional accounts. Business licenses allow you to register enterprise accounts, which can open multiple small stores. Each business license can typically open two individual stores. You can obtain business licenses through online services for a few hundred yuan. Ensure that the licenses are suitable for e-commerce activities. Once registered, you can manage multiple stores by maintaining separate accounts and devices for each store to avoid issues with account violations. This structured approach helps in efficiently managing and scaling your store operations."

        "Content": "A store network, or 'store group,' involves managing multiple stores to achieve higher overall profits. Instead of focusing on making a single store extremely profitable, aim to have several stores each generating moderate profits. For example, managing ten stores each earning 5,000 yuan per month can be more achievable than making one store earn 50,000 yuan. This approach reduces the difficulty and risk associated with scaling a single store to high profit levels. Key management practices include using one device per account to avoid violations, ensuring each store operates independently, and maintaining consistent operational procedures across all stores. This strategy allows for scalable and sustainable growth in the e-commerce space."

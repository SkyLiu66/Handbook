        "Content": "After activating your advertising account, the first step is to fund it. The initial deposit must be 2000 units, but subsequent deposits can be of any amount. Regardless of the platform, whether it's Juguang or Douyin, the first step in information flow advertising is to test your materials. This involves identifying which materials are most effective in attracting customers. After funding your account, create a new advertisement. Depending on your goals, you can choose different types of ads such as product promotion, topic ranking, or e-commerce. For physical stores, customer acquisition ads are most common. It's essential to plan each ad campaign carefully, labeling them for easy identification. For example, label campaigns as 'Test' followed by the ad type. Understanding the different ad types and their placements is crucial. For instance, 'Full Site Ads' cover all ad spaces on the platform, while 'Search Ads' appear during customer searches. 'Information Flow Ads' are commonly seen in video streams and are effective for industries like beauty and hairdressing. By strategically using these ad types, you can optimize your advertising efforts and achieve better customer conversion rates."

        "Content": "To optimize your ad campaigns, it's crucial to understand the different types of ads and their specific uses. 'Full Site Ads' are comprehensive but can be costly and may not always lead to customer conversions. 'Search Ads' are more targeted, appearing during customer searches, making them ideal for reaching users actively looking for related products or services. 'Information Flow Ads' are integrated into the user's content feed, making them less intrusive and more engaging. For cities with populations under 1 million, 'Search Ads' are recommended due to the narrower user base. When setting up your campaigns, always start with a budget cap to avoid overspending. Use 'Information Flow Ads' and 'Search Ads' initially to test your materials and adjust your strategy based on performance. Monitor the engagement and conversion rates of each ad type and make necessary adjustments. For example, if 'Full Site Ads' are not yielding results, switch to 'Information Flow Ads' or 'Search Ads'. By continuously testing and refining your ad campaigns, you can achieve lower costs and higher customer conversions."

For instance, if you're promoting a product, use 'Product Promotion Ads'. If you're aiming to rank in a topic, use 'Topic Ranking Ads'. For physical stores, 'Customer Acquisition Ads' are most effective. When creating ad content, ensure it is engaging and relevant to your target audience. Use high-quality visuals and compelling copy to attract attention. Set a budget cap for each campaign to control spending. During the testing phase, use 'Information Flow Ads' and 'Search Ads' to gauge performance. Adjust your budget and strategy based on the results. For example, if an ad is performing well, you can increase its budget to maximize reach. Conversely, if an ad is underperforming, reduce its budget or pause it. Regularly review and optimize your ad content and budget to ensure you are getting the best return on investment. By managing your ad content and budget effectively, you can achieve better results and grow your business."

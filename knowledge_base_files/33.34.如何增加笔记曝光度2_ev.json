Keywords play a significant role in how the system categorizes and distributes your posts. Ensure that your post titles, content, and tags include specific keywords related to your product or topic. For example, if you are promoting phone cases, include keywords like 'phone case,' 'cute phone case,' and 'iPhone case' in your title and tags. This practice helps the algorithm understand the context of your post and match it with users interested in those topics. By strategically using keywords, you can improve the visibility of your posts, attract more viewers, and ultimately increase engagement."

        "Content": "Artificial intervention involves manually increasing the interaction and engagement on specific posts or products through friends or hired individuals. This can include actions like manually boosting the number of likes, comments, and shares on a post, or increasing the sales of a product by placing orders. The goal is to enhance the visibility and credibility of the account or product quickly. For instance, using artificial intervention can help a new store gain traction within 10 to 15 days. However, it is crucial to use accounts that are not linked to your own or those of your immediate family members to avoid detection. Additionally, it is recommended to use accounts from different cities and primarily female accounts to match the target audience."

        "Content": "Before starting artificial intervention, it is essential to prepare the accounts that will be used. These accounts should not be your own or those of your immediate family members. Ideally, they should belong to friends or acquaintances from different cities to avoid detection. Female accounts are preferred, especially if the product is targeted towards women. Communicate with your friends in advance to ensure they are willing to participate. For example, if you are promoting lingerie, ask your friends if they have interacted with similar content before. If they have, they can start engaging with your posts directly. If not, guide them to search for related keywords and interact with similar content to build a relevant engagement history. This helps in tagging their accounts with the appropriate interests, making the intervention more effective."

        "Content": "To execute artificial intervention effectively, follow a structured approach. First, ensure that the accounts are tagged with relevant interests by having them interact with similar content for about 10 minutes. This includes liking, commenting, and following related posts and accounts. Avoid actions like 'one-click triple' (liking, commenting, and following simultaneously) as it can lead to account suspension. Instead, spread out these actions over multiple sessions. For example, have your friends engage with the content in the afternoon, evening, and before bedtime. This consistent interaction helps in tagging their accounts with the relevant interests, making it more likely for them to see and engage with your posts. By following these steps, you can effectively boost the visibility and engagement of your posts or products, leading to increased sales and account growth."

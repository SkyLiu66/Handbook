Start by searching for your industry keywords in the search bar to find relevant accounts. This method can help you identify about one-third of your competitors. Another approach is to search for notes or posts related to your industry and sort by popularity. This can help you find more than half of your competitors. Additionally, explore the topics associated with these posts to discover even more relevant accounts. If your industry is very niche, consider using data analysis tools like Chen Xiaohong or similar software to filter and identify both corporate and personal accounts. These tools can provide a comprehensive list of competitors, helping you gather a wide range of industry insights."

        "Content": "Evaluating the effectiveness of content involves analyzing engagement metrics such as likes, comments, and shares. High engagement rates often indicate valuable content. One method is to calculate the comment-to-like ratio, which can reveal whether the content sparks discussion or controversy. For example, a post with a high number of comments relative to likes may indicate a highly engaging or controversial topic. Another useful metric is the save-to-like ratio, which shows how many users found the content valuable enough to save for later. High save rates often correlate with informative or useful content, such as guides or tutorials. By focusing on these metrics, you can identify which types of content are most effective for your audience and replicate these strategies to enhance your own content's performance."

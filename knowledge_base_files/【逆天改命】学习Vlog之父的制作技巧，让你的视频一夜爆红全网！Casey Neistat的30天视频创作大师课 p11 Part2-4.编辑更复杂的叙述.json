    "data": " By now you should have finished shooting your own movie. I hope it was cinematic. I hope you found some unexpected surprises. And I hope as you begin the process that I'm about to dive into, I hope you're doing it with a little bit of confidence in what you have captured. A little bit of confidence is about how much I have right now. This part of the edit process where I look at all my footage in the edit bay is daunting and scary for me. The idea that I have to take all of this and turn it into a story. But that's what I'm going to do and that's today's lesson. I have no idea what I'm looking for. I have no idea what I'm doing. I just start. I just dive in with like this pile of clay and I'm trying to turn it into a beautiful sculpture. But this part, this part is fun. And looking at all of this footage, like there's a certain sense of accomplishment. Like I know that somewhere in here is a movie, is a story. I've got all the pieces. To continue the metaphor I used earlier, it's like I'm looking at my kitchen. I've got my kitchen counter and I've got all the ingredients I need to make an amazing meal. Now I just got to cook it. If you're feeling that way, that's good. That means you're doing everything right. But I'm definitely feeling that way and I always feel this way with every movie I do. And if I'm repeating myself right now, it's because I'm trying to procrastinate starting this edit. This is also common. I would love you to get a bran muffin right now. I'm not gonna. We're going to start the edit. Okay. Starting the edit. I literally know my first shot. My goal with the opening shot is to kind of, I want to give the viewer a sense of intrigue. I want them to be like, what's going on here? There's not a lot of time to do that because what's going on here and this is boring are very similar. Fine line between the two. So this shot I like, I'm looking down at my computer as if I'm seeing something interesting, but I can't look down at my computer for too long. So, so apparently, okay, that's not the take. I knew that I delivered my line and turn my head, which is the shot that I'm looking for. I forgot that it was on two different clips, but I've got options here. This is why I always take multiple takes. Even when it's just me talking to the camera, I need those options when I'm editing. If it doesn't work out in the edit the way I thought it would in my head, I got other options to fall back on. That's especially easy in controlled environments like when I'm shooting in here. When I was out in the street, maybe interacting with salespeople in the Sunglass store, for example, there's no second take there. What I get is all I get. Um, that's fun because it promotes that sense of spontaneity and realness, but that's also an extreme liability when you forget to check if your microphones working and half of your movie is shot with no audio. So, uh, apparently, stumbled on my words. So, uh, apparently, So we're not making a lot of progress here. Um, I'm four seconds into this video and I don't like either of the shots that I did. I'm not gonna reshoot it even though I want to. So, uh, app- apparently, Like that's the shot that I- what I want is for me to say, so apparently, and then turn my head. Why didn't I get that when I was shooting that? Okay. I'm gonna cheat it with the sound. So what you're seeing me do here is I'm gonna take the tail of that, line, so apparently, and I'm gonna lay that, tail under the next shot. And that will, to the viewer, hopefully, hide the fact that I didn't actually turn my head in the first shot. It will connect these two shots in a way that with any lock it'll have the, uh, the viewer not even notice that there's a cut there. The very best edits you can do are the edits that are never noticed by anyone watching your movie. That means you've succeeded. Okay, that is the last frame there. Before I go, I'm gonna go back to the camera. Before I turn my head. Apparently, The goal here is that this looks like one contiguous shot. Let's see if it was accomplished. So apparently, Now it's a home run! Apparently, Okay, so there's a bit of an issue here, which is, look it, I turn my head, and then there's this long pause before I stand up. In between me turning my head and standing up, it's just three seconds of me looking. That's boring, especially right at the top of an edit. Right at the top of a movie. You've just clicked play, and you're like, okay, something interesting is happening, and then it's not. It's the back of my head. So I need to gussy this up. Music. That's where the music needs to come in, for sure. Music always sets the tone, and the music sets the tone here. The tone of this music, like the emotion that I'm looking to convey, is one of, like, curiosity. Like, it should be, like, a quizzical kind of vibe, where it's like, hmm, what's going on? But almost in, like, a Mr. Magoo kind of way. Like, not serious. Like, not like a Philip Glass level documentary where we're uncovering a hidden mystery or something. This is meant to be playful. It should be soft and gentle, but curious. Like a, boom, boom, boom, boom. Like, what's coming next? Kind of foreshadowing via the music. And that needs to go, one more time. Apparently, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. You know, like, let you know, I'm trying to figure something out. Uh, how do I do this? Come on, let's figure this out. That's what the music needs to say. So now starts the music hunt. I organize all of my music into a file called music. After I use a song, I usually mark it as used by just, uh, putting, like, a red tag on it, and I know I've used that song before. I try not to use the same song more than once. Maybe that's specific to me, but, like, I don't know. It's like, the music has such a relationship with the imagery that if you hear a song in one of my movies, and you've heard that song in a different movie, there might be some disconnect in that. You might associate it with the other movie. A quick aside. If there's a song that you love because you saw it in a movie, you can never use that song. You can never use music that you discovered in another movie, because if you discovered it in a movie, and it was so good that it stuck with you, Son of a Preacher Man in, uh, Pulp Fiction was so good. Every song in every one of Wes Anderson's movies. Brilliant! You're not allowed to use any of those songs, because they're already spoken for. And if I see your movie, and it's got some Wes Anderson, John Lennon song in it, I'm immediately gonna just think of my favorite scene from Rushmore, and I'm not gonna be thinking of your movie. That's like a Casey Ism, take it personally. I mean, you do whatever you want, but I feel that way. Okay, now time to dive in here. I'm gonna start with this here, because this is a kid that I met online. I listened to their SoundCloud, I was like, this is great. And then, this individual sent me like a whole library of kind of beats and sounds that might work. So with any luck, I will find something in this catalog that does work. Now, assuming you don't have like your own catalog on your machine, this is where you can turn to like an online music source, a place where you can license music for relatively cheap on YouTube, but they have a whole catalog of music and beats that you can use for free that will work on their site without having any monetization issues. I mean, or just use whatever music you want. I'm trying to make the best movie here. Don't let the music hold you back. Scary, ominous, horror, no. Serious, foreboding. Something's coming, and it's a little dark. Maybe uplifting, maybe inspirational. Definitely not what I'm going for. Right? Curious? Hmm. Where are we headed? Oh! That's where we're headed. I do wish that intro was longer, though. Let me just see where this song goes. What I'm looking for when I scrub through a song like this is like, the first five songs of this song, I'm positive work. But if it goes to a weird place, like it gets too fast, or it just sort of shifts in tone to something darker, or inspirational, or something more melancholy, then I think twice, because then it means I'm not going to be able to use that same song for this whole act. Or this whole segment. This is great. Little repetitive, but that's fine. Okay, let's see if it works. Now, where to place this song? I want this song to kick in at the exact moment the viewer of the video thinks to themselves, what the heck is he looking at? So that's what I'm looking for. Okay. There. Back a couple frames. Watch it from the top. Actually, I need a couple of frames here. I'm a viewer right now, and I want to sort of be able to look at this set before I start talking, before I know that I have to pay attention to the funny looking guy in the glasses. I want to be able to examine the set. It's a very interesting shot. All that chaos. So, apparently... A little too soon, maybe. Yeah, okay. Uh-huh. Right? Okay, that works. I'm like, hmm, something curious is happening here. You have like 10 seconds to make your viewer, to make anyone care about what your video. You have like, 10 seconds is generous. You have like 3 seconds to sort of pull them in enough for the viewer to give you 10 seconds. And to keep going, and to hang in there, and want to see this video through. So, of course I'm obsessing over these first, like, what are we at now? We are at 8 seconds. I'm obsessing over this because this is the first thing the viewer is going to see when they click play. And one rule I have, this is a good rule. Never put titles at the beginning of your video. Never put some vanity like, you know, a film made by Casey Neistat with cinematography also by Casey Neistat. Edited also by Casey. Like, you don't need it. I know it feels good and maybe it makes it seem like it's more pro, but no one wants to see it. A good rule is like, put the credits at the end, because if people hang in there long enough to get to the end of your movie, then yeah, they want to see who made it. They want to see who did the cinematography. They want to learn who made all that awesome music. You have to earn that. You have to earn that by getting them to sit through your whole video. Don't put it at the beginning. Just make your beginning really interesting so they'll hang in there. Apparently... Where I cut that depends on the next shot. Like, how seamlessly can I weave these two together? By the way, this shot's awesome. This shot is great. I'm trying to match getting up from the chair and walking up to the screen. Doesn't need to be perfect, but like, obsessing over continuity is one of my, uh, one of my secret passions, so this second shot is so different from this first shot. I need the audience to know this is the same space you're looking at the same space, but from literally opposing directions. One is facing east, one is facing west. This is a prime example of a sequence that makes it feel like I filmed this with 50 different cameras. Or is it just one? Okay, so... This is going from a third person perspective to a first person perspective. Uh, for me this is like such a satisfying shot progression. You're seeing me from this direction, you're seeing me from that direction. I'm walking away from the camera, I'm walking into the camera, and I'm showing the perspective of the camera. That one, two, three is meant to be really satisfying. And I say that knowing right now we're, you know, ten seconds in. This is the first thing the audience is gonna see, and what they know so far is that I'm curious about something. The music is sort of fun and interesting. Where are we going with this song? And now the cinematography, right off the bat, is trying to make it as compelling as possible. The cinematography is not this good throughout the whole video, but at the front, it's great to lure people in. A little bait and switch. And a little bit more tap-tappy. Tappy-tap-tap steam here. There we go. The reason why I used this clip's audio under this is to really make them match. I'm sure it'd be close enough, but why not make it perfect. Now I need to get the audience to the door. The next action is at the door. There's the door. I need to get the audience there, but this is a long shot. This is a five and a half second shot. I can't afford five and a half seconds. Okay, I'm looking at the TV. Looking behind the TV. That's great. See this swish pan? It's blurry enough that maybe I can cheat it. Let's see what this feels like. That's one second and twenty frames. Almost two full seconds I just chopped out because this, no additional information. There's nothing interesting in this shot. Get rid of it. I like that. Okay. Camera pans up. Now I'm looking at the door. I'm letting the audience know, action's at this door. Up, cut in. Pull back. Alright, that's the that's the action. Ready? There. So... Feels good. Okay, now I have all of these redundant shots. Look at these redundancies. One, two, three, reverse angle, four, five. It's all the same stuff. These shots are all awesome. I put a lot of work into these shots. I like these shots. My favorite kind of cinematography, like locked off shots with really square, with the subject matter being really square in the shots. I love it, but nothing here is new. Look it. This is like twenty shots of the same thing, and that thing is a door. This is not interesting as it is. So I need to really make this interesting now with the edit. I'm trying to communicate one thing here, that I fixed the GoPro that was stuck in the door. So I want to do this as efficiently as possible. I want to leave each of these shots up long enough to sort of focus on them and see what I'm seeing, but not long enough where you can indulge in that shot. Because there's too many. In aggregate, to get together, they'll equal something way more than they would if they were just standing alone, if they were just one part. So here's where I am with the sequence. Ready? Boom, boom. Next shot. I pull it back. Next shot. Okay, this eyeball shot is amazing, but I need about two seconds of it. You see, look. I think when I was shooting this, I mentioned how I kept looking at the camera to see myself in the monitor to check framing, which doesn't work. That's what I'm doing here. But then I look into the lens there, and it kind of works. And also, continuity error. Look, I've got on sunglasses, and then here it's just my naked eye. I will ask you, the audience, to forgive that mistake. It's such a cool shot, I'm not going to let it go, even though I kind of screwed it up. Something's a little off. Okay, let's listen. Listen to this part of the song. The ramp up. That beat means something should be happening. Listen to the ramp up again. A ramp is when it goes like And nothing's happening. Okay. This is where I do this a lot, but this is where you really can let the music work for you. So what I just did was when I tap that screen, it's loud enough to overwhelm the music. So what I'm going to try to do here is use that sound to break the music, as in to stop the music. That way I don't have to use that bass hitting, because I don't have anything to go with that. When I hear a song go from kind of introductory, just a very simple beat, and then a big beat hits, I need a shift in action. I don't have a shift in action, so I need to loop that or something. First I need to break it. So let's see what this feels like. Listen to the music. Pay attention to the music. It worked, but I didn't like where the music cut. I need this action to be right there. So where can I afford to lose a little bit? I'm going to try to shave a little. One, two. And then shave a little here. One, two, three. See if it still holds up. Here we go. What's going on here? You hear me say, like, mumble what's going on here. Huh. Huh. There's room here for the song to come back up. This song here, right here, this little bit, that is, that's just a loop of the same song here. Listen. But now, same song, just put a little fade up here. It's a little bit more subtle when I introduce the song again. The goal is, I don't want anybody to notice I'm using the same, the same piece of that song, and you shouldn't. Huh. So now I have to build out the repair scene of the door, of the GoPro camera in the door. The amount of shots that I have is kind of insane. What I'm trying to drive towards is I have a line right here. The door cam's a GoPro camera. GoPro Hero 4. This thing's probably been on non-stop for like six years? Seven years? I think I finally killed it. Okay, I want to use this line. I like me using this line because what I'm not saying is like, my door cam monitor is broken and now I'm fixing it. I'm not literally saying what you're seeing, the images tell you that. Clearly I'm trying to fix something. This is me acknowledging and adding a level of kind of interestingness instead of it's just a generic me fixing a camera. I'm not letting you know that this camera's been on for, whatever I say, like six years straight and I don't think it's gonna work. Intrigue. Interest. Another layer of information. Like, the story's getting more dynamic and we're 21 seconds in. Oh my god. This is gonna be a long lesson. So here's where I am. Here's where I am with music. Huh. The door cam's a GoPro Hero 4. Uh, song again is killing me. I'm not gonna switch this song out. I like it, but it's not, it's not... Like, this doesn't work. Ready? My voice is competing with it. If I make it a little quieter... The door cam's a GoPro Hero 4. Yeah, that doesn't work either. I'm trying to build momentum with this sequence. The momentum is me actually doing the action, which is fixing the door cam. If there's too much momentum, the audience isn't gonna understand what I'm doing. It's just gonna be this sort of montage-y sequence. I'm adding new layers of information with what I'm saying, which hopefully sort of boosts the interestingness of it. But there's a cadence here. There has to be pacing, there has to be flow that works. Otherwise it's not gonna be satisfying to watch. Music plays a huge role in dictating that pace. And right now this song just isn't hitting where I want it to hit. So I can try to re-edit it to get me there. Hold on. I think this... I think I've got something here. So listen to this. Let me isolate. Get rid of that. Quiet these. Listen. Hear that drop? That drops? And that's actually leading into the beat. Okay, I'm not using the beat, but maybe, maybe, maybe I can afford to actually let the song drop out again like I did earlier. Because I'm speaking, that's like an oral cue that perhaps I can kill music there. Let's see it all. Let's see the sequence. The door cam's a GoPro Hero 4. That works. This thing's probably been on non-stop for like six years? Seven years? I think I finally killed it. Talk about oral cues. Listen. It works, but like if you've ever owned a GoPro, you know there's a chime here that's supposed to go with those little lights? I have downloaded a GoPro sound effect. If I can use a fake sound to embellish whatever it is I'm trying to communicate, I definitely use the fake sound. So at the beginning of my counterfeit handbag video, I put in a police chirp. Because at the beginning I wanted it to feel like we're doing something we shouldn't be doing. I want to let you know, like, we're up to no good over here. The police car sort of communicated that, but the minute I put in like that boop, boop, it had a completely different tone. And like, look. This moment is a moment I have to celebrate. Like the camera turned on, so I need an oral cue there. I think I finally killed it. Listen. It kind of changes it. Come on! It still works! Alright, this is a little long. Like, watch how long between I turn it on and when I notice the screen and before I say my line. It goes. Come on! It still works! See, this is fat, but I think I have to leave it. I'm going to go ahead and do this. Watch, if I get rid of the fat. I think I finally killed it. Come on! It still works! When I get rid of that piece in the middle, it just feels like I'm faking it. You don't see me discover the screen being on. So from a narrative perspective, by this point in time, I say it still works. You know what I was trying to do. It's a little bit of mission accomplished. Come on! It still works! So I can't dwell here. So now I need to get out of this intro. This is not Act 1. This is just an intro. Me fixing the GoPro. I've got to get out of this whole thing and get back to my main story. My main story being these glasses, which I haven't even mentioned in the video yet. And we're 42 seconds in. So I need to get out of here. Camera goes back in. I adjust the camera. This shot is questionable because can you actually see what's going on? What's actually going on is this is the reverse where you're supposed to be able to see through the peephole. You can't really see anything. You know, and then this is like it being fixed in there. Me checking the camera. Okay, the music has to come back up here somewhere. So listen to this piece in the song. There's like a shh tick. There's like a ramp up and then like a tick sound. I want to cut on the tick. Killed it. Killed it. Finally killed it. Six years? Seven years? I think I finally killed it. So I think this actually works better without music underneath it. So look, here's where I drop the music. The door cam's a GoPro Hero 4. This thing's probably been on non-stop for like six years? Seven years? I think I finally killed it. Come on! It still works! Here's why I think that works. You want to hear what I'm saying here. I don't need this to be embellished with music. I think I finally killed it. This cut would be awkward, but I think I can probably even mask this with the sound a little bit more. Finally killed it. Okay. That works. This long silence. Ready? You, the viewer, realized that it worked before I realized that it worked. Because you can see stuff I can't. Like me, Casey, the character, the real person in this video, I was staring at the camera. I didn't see the screen turn on. By having it silent, I'm able to sort of lean into that tension. Is it going to work? Is it not going to work? Is he going to notice? How's he going to react? Music there might tell you how you're supposed to feel. The absence of music is, uh, I don't know, for me it feels like sort of curious. It's intriguing. I mean, it's not that intriguing, but you know what I mean. Here, ready? Come on! It still works! Yes, that's it. I wave. Okay, perfect. And now my intro is done. Let me just drop in a shot of me talking next so I can see what that feels like. Me talking. Starts. Ah, that's better. Okay, right here. So the music is serving a really good role here, because the music is letting the viewer know that the scene is over. It's doing the heavy lifting for me. So not only does this shot sort of feel like a punchline, like it's funny, but listen to how the music plays in. Ah, that's better. It totally works. And then I watch it one more time all the way through just to make sure that sequence is complete and there's nothing more I can shave off of it. When it comes to editing, masters at editing, the greatest editors out there, in my opinion, are not defined by what shots they use, but by what they cut out. You want to strip everything down. Rick Rubin, like, the greatest hip-hop music producer ever, in my opinion. Rick Rubin, when he works with artists, he strips out as much noise as he can to get to the rawness of it. I love that. And when it comes to videos, for me it's just like, chop everything out. Just cut everything out until you're left with the best version possible. No matter how much you love a scene. With that, I'm now gonna review this and see if there's anything else I can shave out to make it more concise, make the pacing better, more pleasing to watch. So, apparently... What is going on here? Huh. The door cam's a GoPro Hero 4. This thing's probably been on non-stop for, like, six years? Seven years? I think I finally killed it. Come on! It still works! Great. I think it's great. And what I said before about it's what you cut that makes your edit great, not what you leave in, I think there's a natural question, which is like, well, how do I know what to cut? And the answer to that is really challenging. The way that I was looking at this is like, I'm measuring it on interestingness, I'm looking for redundancies, I'm asking myself, like, is this boring? Is this compelling? Have I already seen this information? Does it feel repetitive? That process of self-evaluation is one that's like, it takes time. You have to find, like, you're relying on your instincts, and it takes time to train those instincts to know what to look for. So, you might cut out too much. That's a risk, and you're left with a story that feels incomplete, that has holes in it. You might leave way too much fat in there. And then it's like a story that is drowning because I don't know what to pay attention to. And that process, it really does take time but I think if you're looking for it, that you can actually speed it up. If you know that what you're looking for is a way to, like, hone your skills, to make your stories as concise as possible, if that's what you're doing with every review, you will get there, and you'll get there faster. But, what I'm doing, there's no science here. This is just intuition. If I were to edit, like, one of my early movies now, if I were to edit Bike Lanes today, I could have made that movie two minutes long, faster, and funnier, and people would have liked it more. But, I don't have that luxury, so I'm just trying to get better here. So with that, I'm now back at my desk in our story here, and it's time for me to set up what this movie's actually about, which is the video camera sunglasses. Ah, that's better. Okay, I like that line. Ah, that's better. That works. Okay, so, see, I punched in, I zoomed in for the... So, apparently Ray-Ban... I zoom in for the delivery of these lines. I did that because, again, this shot, this wide, it's meant to show you the context of the whole space. The focus of this is meant to be that screen behind me. It's not meant to be me or what I'm saying. The focus here is the environment. The minute I deliver the line, the focus needs to shift from the environment to me and the substance of what I'm saying. So, apparently... A lot of takes here. So, apparently Ray-Ban launched a pair of sunglasses that have a built-in camera. So, I said it a bunch of different ways, but I'm using this because I say the word so apparently. And if you remember... So, apparently... And then I interrupt the whole thing. And what this is doing, I don't know if people are going to pick up on this, but somewhere in the viewer's subconscious, maybe they'll connect the dots that... So, apparently... So, apparently are the two words that actually start this story. And everything in the middle here, this was nothing more than sort of a quick speed bump. A minor digression, a non-sequitur in my story, and now we're back to the story. So, apparently Ray-Ban... I'm trying to join these shots together. I'm doing it with audio. The video sort of does it, but I like how I hang here after I say, that's better. And I lean forward. It also nicely dovetails with me leaning forward here. Better. So, apparently Ray-Ban launched a pair of sunglasses that have a built-in camera. Now, I... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... So, again, this is a little bit tighter. This is a lot tighter. And the reason why I went with this much closer shot here is I know that I'm going to talk about my sunglasses, so I wanted to really bring the camera in, make my face super prominent in frame here, so when I reference the sunglasses, it's, uh, you know, they're more prominent in the shot. But I gotta make these work together. There's a cut here. The goal is to have no one notice the cut, from being like a medium of me sitting here to a close-up of me sitting here. I'm hiding the cut behind a little bit of audio. Behind this audio, which is me finishing this line. This audio. Camera? Camera? So if I can put the second half of the word camera under this shot, then maybe... Sunglasses that have a built-in camera? Now, I've been known... ...built-in camera? Now, I've been known from time to time to wear sunglasses, and I also sometimes use a video camera, so this seems like maybe an appropriate product for me. Great! An appropriate product for me. Cut. An appropriate product for me. There. Alright, now I'm just gonna watch back that sequence. I'm not gonna watch back the whole movie here. I know that my intro felt good. I don't need to see that whole intro attached to the beginning of this first act here. I just wanna see what the lead-up feels like, and then how that, like, monologue to camera, how that flows. That's what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a little bit of a more... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... During the process of the order that this was introduced in this Caleb I try not say anything in this 16 seconds- it isn't super directly, very literally related to what's about to happen. I just deliver the facts and then we go. I don't know if this is my own personal insecurities talking or if this is me, like the filmmaker talking, but anytime I'm sitting, anytime I'm doing this shot I'm sitting talking to camera, like I'm talking to you now. In my movies, I from a place of like, I don't click play on a movie so I can watch a guy sit and talk. Unless that's the point. And that's not the point of this video. This is just here meant to set up what the video is. So I want it to be as minimal as possible without feeling like I'm cheating the movie. Can't just be a blip. Uh, it can't be this long drawn out thing. It needs to sit somewhere in the middle. Give me the minimum amount of information to get moving. And I do think I accomplished that. I like this. This works. See how I end up again. It's like maybe an appropriate product for me. What I don't say, and I didn't record this, it's not in my roughs here. I never say the words and now I'm going to go buy these glasses because I set something up, but I don't want the audience to know what I'm about to go do. I don't want to let them in on that because this is fun and exciting. And I know the shots. We just did them. I've got this shot. I've got this shot. I've got all this fun momentum going through the city. What happened here? Speaker 2 Speaker 1 I've got all these shots that I'm going to use that are awesome. So that's what I want it to be. Me finishing this line product for me and then boom, we get this explosive sequence. Like just give it to me. I want to embellish the intrigue and I want to keep people from getting confused. I don't think this is confusing and like to go from me saying that's a product for me to this like fast paced action scene in the street feels pretty good. Speaker 2 Speaker 2 This shot of the boosted word. Let the audience know what I'm about to do. Obviously, I'm about to go somewhere. and how that was not good for the previous scene, that didn't work for the previous scene. Well, it definitely works for this scene if I can time it right. Ready? Finally, I'm going to get to use that bass. Like, finally there's an opportunity for me to lean into. Because that explosion, the bass note can happen when I grab the skateboard. We're moving on. I want the bass to hit right when I grab the board. Yeah, perfect. Great. Definitely an opportunity to have done a sequence here of me walking out the door, going down the steps, going outside. I sort of feel like I used up all the permission I had for those indulgent, fun little shots in shooting the GoPro. I'm going to do a GoPro sequence in the intro. If I'm the viewer, I just like, I want this story to move. We're a minute and 18 seconds into it. I know what's going on. I'm ready to get into it. So give it to me. So because of that, I want this to move a little bit faster than it otherwise would if I didn't have that, like, drawn out intro. I see the drop on the skateboard. I want that sound, that bzzzt, that's what I'm looking for. Great. So if you remember, this was the spot where I found these construction workers, and their, like, jackhammers were so in my face that I was like, this is interesting. There's something here. I want that. I want that interestingness to work here, but I'm not sure. And what I'm doing here from, like, this is just a little thing, but, like, I look over my shoulder. This has nothing to do with the movie, but I always do that when I'm filming myself on the skateboard to make sure I'm not going to get hit by a car. When I'm talking to the camera while riding an electric skateboard through traffic in New York City, before I click record, I like to take a peek to make sure nobody's going to run me over it. That's all that is. It kind of feels right. Look. See, if I just started here. Happy to see the city. Maybe that feels right, too. OK, I take it back. I'm going to split the difference. Happy to see the city hasn't gotten any quieter since I've been gone. Music comes up, we move. I know there wasn't too much interestingness that I captured between the construction site and actually getting to Ray-Ban, which is right here. I'm scrubbing through this stuff to see if there's something. Music plays. Honestly, I'm just sick of all these shots. I've seen these before in my other videos. Music plays. Music plays. Music plays. Music plays. Let me see if I put. Maybe the answer to what goes there is nothing. Just get me to the store. Music plays. Yeah, I mean, it feels good. I'm moving. We've got momentum now. OK, heading into the Ray-Ban store. Music plays. Music plays. Music plays. Music plays. Music plays. Music plays. Music plays. There's a lot of noise in this retail store where I'm buying the sunglasses. There's the music that's playing in there, and then there's the dialogue between me and the salesperson, which happens here. I don't want music playing here at all, so I need to find a way to break the music again. I need to find the spot. There's a beat that I like. Ready? That beat right there. I don't know a lot about music, but there are always sort of starts and stops and ups and downs in every song. So I try to bend the songs, shape the songs, cut the songs to suit my movie, and it always works. I don't always know what I'm looking for, but I always find something that works. Listen to this little beat right here. That and then it fades down. So if I cut there. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Little clipping. That's rich. So then I just have to mask that cut with the noise that's happening in real life, with a diagenic sound. Okay. See what I do here. When we were outside of this store, this Ray-Ban store, I talked about how I like to keep my camera down when I'm walking into an environment like this, someplace that I don't have any control over. So because of that, the cinematography is not good. Like look at, this is like the hero shot. This is exactly the glasses. The first time you're seeing the glasses and it's backlit. On the upper left-hand corner here, see this window? The camera's trying to expose to that and that's why it's just so dark. I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking at here. So I'm going to have to really put some effort, really put some effort into this to try to make sense of all this. The focus isn't good. Like movement's too fast. This shot is garbage. Garbage. Okay. Let's try this shot. Oh, so this is like a transition situation. Do you have these in black? No, the black only comes with the blue. Are those transition as well? No. This is an organic conversation I'm having with a real person. And you know, I'm talking about like, oh, so this is like a transition situation. The different lenses on these glasses. I'm talking about, do you have these in black? They're inventory. Like I can barely hear her. This isn't easy to follow along. So what, what information do I need to convey here? I need to convey that these are the glasses that I want and that they don't have them. So I, so I need a piece of dialogue between this young lady and myself that conveys that in as few of words. It's possible. Can I have, are those transition as well? No. Okay. Can I have a, can I have a pair of these? No. Okay. Can I have a pair of these? Good. How much do they cost? These cost $2.99. But we don't have this style in store. Are you kidding me? Yes. Okay, how much do they cost? I don't care how much they cost But we don't have this style in store. Are you kidding? Okay, that's the critical piece of information her saying we don't have these glasses now I interrupt her with are you kidding me and Honestly, like you can't see me saying it. It feels a little bit aggressive This young lady and myself we're having like a super jovial conversation And I said are you kidding me was sort of like a smile on my face, and it was very gentle But I don't like the way it sounds it sort of misrepresents our interaction It sounds like weirdly aggressive So I want to really isolate the piece of information that I need here to focus on which is her saying We don't have this style in store We don't have this style in store But we don't have this style in store you don't have this style in store Okay All right, so this is where the nightmare begins see the shot what I'm saying right now is they didn't have the glasses I need in store, so I have to go up to another store that the lady recommended I don't have it all I have is this light hiss and That's what happens when you don't check your microphone. That's a critical piece of information It's that piece of information that begins this whole chain of events in the absence of that information look Look look look look look I Can put all these shots in here? What is this this is nothing and then if I skip that shot, okay? We're moving again. I don't know where we're going or why we're going there. That's a long shot This is me giving further context to where I'm going No, that's just my shirt This is me giving further context to where we're going and all I hear is hissing and Then this is me entering the store Asking if they have the glasses and all there is is hissing Normally when I screw up a shot like this, and I don't have audio I just throw it out and make it work without it, but this is like this Scene is the catalyst for the rest of the whole first act the fact. They don't have the glasses Back there have to go on this mission. I don't have it So I have to work with these pieces now to try and recreate that. You're now seeing me frustrated at myself. And look, if you can make it through your whole edit without getting a little frustrated, without being like, why did I shoot it that way? Why did I do it that way? You're probably doing it wrong. There's this rule that my brother Van always said to me when I was first getting started. And he said, you learn how to shoot in the edit. And what that means is like this shot right here. I wish it wasn't backlit. I'm realizing that now in the edit, I should have stood on the other side of the table. So the sunlight came in and lit the subject instead of me filming into the into the window. And then you learn to shoot in the edit. You know what I'm learning here? Check if the microphone works before every shot. I'm learning that. So embrace your mistakes and learn from them. Now I have to dig myself out of this hole. I think I have an idea. This throwaway shot right here that I said I didn't want to use. Very clear. It looks very disושaural. I'm hearing that there are mis banned and cut shortи and things that can investor buy why would we do this? Let's see. I was blinded by this. Lily Das also wanted to learn a little bit about her.\" To have the critical thinking gear off there all the way. Ooh, right to the point I wish it wasn't on a table but she has got two things new. Theunächst thing to do. I can maybe like stop shooting. And then I had to figure out the next one, right? Wait a minute. What's she still doing? All I can do is just sit there. gonna be lost without the context. Like I don't get to build another scene that connects me leaving this door and entering the next door. I don't have the context for that. So I'll make it much shorter and I'll put a tiny montage in there. And you know what, look how much effort I put into this shot, ready? Watch, the camera comes up really smooth and I start talking just as I fly by a cop car going about 25 miles an hour up Sixth Avenue. This is a great shot! And it's going in the garbage, ready? Watch how good this shot is. Oh, it's so good! It's like I'm flying through the city and it goes in the garbage. In order to let the audience know to really pay attention to this text, this isn't a subtitle. I wanna like thrust this in their face because this text has to be the motivation for the next montage where I go to the next store. Has to carry us through. So I'm gonna use a, a technique here taught to me by my dear friend, Max Joseph, terrific editor. It's called CSA. So as she says the words, the titles are gonna come up. Hi, how are you? And then you're sort of forced to read them as you're hearing her. And then it's an excuse to let them hang. But we don't have this style in store. We don't have this style in store. That kind of works. We don't have this style in store. We don't have this style in store. This is what that looks like. I didn't time it that well, but I think it's close enough. But we don't have this style in store. It's always a pain to do those titles to try to time it. But like it is, it's effective. I'm gonna let those titles hang for a minute. I'm recycling this shot that, this backlit shot that I don't like, but this is an excuse to let the titles hang and really like emphasize. This wasn't just, this wasn't just putting texts to what she said, but like this is a plot point in the movie. This is a plot point in the movie. Again, I don't expect the audience to think of it so formally, but as long as they're focused on the text, then I'm accomplishing what I'm trying to do here. And this is what I'm delivering my next line. Luckily you can't see what I'm saying, so I'm wearing a mask. So I'm just gonna salvage the, I'm just gonna salvage the very end of this, show that I'm leaving. And then I'm gonna get, yeah. And then I'm gonna get into the, like zooming through the streets. And look, I'm gonna have to skip a lot of this footage, like a lot of this crew, cruising here. Okay, so here's where I'm at. Again, I put her subtitle and then I let it hang over the shot of the glasses. And then I let it hang over me leaving. And maybe I can get away with letting it hang over the street, but I'm not sure. The idea is that this text isn't just connected to her saying that, but this is the whole scene that they don't have this style in store. What? What? What? Yeah, that feels good. So this is the shot. This is the shot of me, remember, I'm sort of squatting low, holding my camera steady while I'm on my electric skateboard. Looks like this. But if you speed it up, it looks like this. Then if you take the image and you double it, but make the top image at like, what did I set it to? 60%, 12% opacity. It gives it that sort of shadow effect. And it really emphasizes, I'm covering a lot of distance here. I'm going somewhere far away. Outside of the Macy's, this is the shot. This is the shot that I set the camera up on top of that green box and I time-lapse the whole building. And then I picked it up slowly and moved in. This is what that looks like in practice. So the time-lapse will move quickly like this. And at the very end, I carefully pick it up and carry it in. I'm gonna time that to the music a little bit and connect that to the previous time-lapse. Okay. Now, this shot here is magic. Like this is some of the best stuff. That character's upside down. So this shot, so the head, which can be edited many ways. I pick up that moment. When I finally oughta try the movies. These guys can see what I'm trying to get out of the clip. The earlier that they get there, it begins the next kilow 순. So a tenth of a foot from here. And then I always have to filming that conversation again and again. Even though I'm trying, I have to film it and then I'll be mocked. I'm just gonna help them put it together. But previously on the film, when I was QianLiang, it was interesting. remember this remember when we did this this is what I sat down and tried to like fake do the voiceover like record the voiceover this is the dub this is my ADR listen I was in there which is okay they didn't have them there but I got a phone call while I was in there from just me repeating myself over and over it said that they had them so I need to make this work and I'm gonna shift things up a little bit here I've been walking you through my edit process along with me step by step explaining what I'm doing what I want to do now as we move ahead is I want to edit the sequence with my head down and then I would explain to you what I did and I hope that gives a different perspective in addition to like how I'm editing that'll give me an opportunity to explain why I'm editing it that way so I'm gonna start with this scene how do I make sense of this this voice dubbing how do I make sense of having lost all the shots how do I make sense of you know I'm editing this scene and I'm going to edit this scene and I'm going to have this great shot which I don't get to use because there's no audio I'd love to skip this and just dump all this footage but this footage has such a relationship this footage tees up the rest of this scene the rest of this act so I have to make this work one way or another so far I've used text over it and now I'm going to try to use this this voice over to make this work okay they didn't have them there but I got a phone call while I was there from a different Sunglass Hut which is crazy because um I didn't give them my phone number whatever I'm going downtown gonna get them now you know my wife makes fun of me for speaking with my hands so much but I think the reason why this works is because of my gesticulating I say I have to go downtown and then I say I don't know how they got my number and it's sort of it makes the voiceover work you can't tell that I'm not saying it the mask doesn't hurt either um I didn't give them my phone number whatever I'm going downtown gonna get them now no one's gonna notice that there's no way all right now I've left there I'm headed downtown to get the glasses this is that absolutely magical shot where I I ran into a police officer who genuinely thought he was gonna like give me a ticket or yell at me or something instead he just asked for a selfie so I want to break this up a little bit um to show us taking a selfie together I had my camera out while he took the selfie can I take a quick picture of you all right keep up the good work sorry good to be back in the city I hope they have them so this is the exact shot that I use when I'm going uptown it's just sort of a simple speed ramp but then I I overlaid that with the same shot uh at like half opacity so it gives this shadowy effect I hope they have them my concern right now is pacing um I need a consistent tempo to carry me through if I lose that tempo and it slows down too much I stop caring if it goes too fast I'm not getting the information and then I don't care take care yeah here let me see your phone I'm really I hope they have them I'm the one who called thank you so much all right I'm cutting out this little line where you're the one who called you're the one who called because I didn't call them they called me and as much as I like that interaction it's just going to confuse things so I'm going to dump that audio and stick it above my conversation with Irving where I asked him if he called me if that doesn't make sense just watch it I hope that happens thank you so much anytime yeah that worked help to have them thank you so much anytime I got a question yes how did you get my phone number well I have a caller ID and I have a list of the people that have a call asking for them so this is the moment when I'd moment when I get the glasses. He says I have them and then I see the glasses. I want a total tone shift here. I want it to go from this like that sort of quizzical curious song of looking for something to something much more playful, something much more fun, something much more like almost victorious but playful, playful, playful. That's what I need here for music. This is the track that I found. But I only like the intro for this. So I'm looping it. It's just a fun bed. Great. Fun little bed for that sequence. This is what playing telling comes down to. You nailed it. Thank you. I'm going to get my phone number. Well, I have a caller ID and I have a list of the people that have a call asking for them. Oh, okay. You called here earlier. Okay. Okay. I remember you. Thank you. Thank you so much. You're the best. Take care. Yeah, of course. Of course. Of course. Okay. Asking for. Yeah, of course. Of course. Of course. Yeah, of course. Of course. Of course. I'm going to use the beat here to hide this cut. Take care. And take care. Take care. Take care. Yeah, of course, of course. Of course. I'm gonna use the beat here to hide this cut. It's an interesting interaction. But I think the interestingness of that interaction ends when the security arch says, can I have a picture with you? I don't need to take it any further. It's a cool little moment. I get through it then move on. Yeah, of course. Of course. Of course. Yeah, of course. Of course. Of course. I found my next song. I'm moving on from the intro of that song from just that simple into the actual beat of the song. Ready? Song's moving. What I want to place here, I have all these shots of people asking me for selfies, people saying hi. What I don't want to do in this sequence that takes me from getting the sunglasses all the way to the studio, I don't want any more of the fast motion stuff, any more of that effort of me showing myself traveling through space. I've done that. And also, in using those shots earlier in this video, it was about showing this sort of chaos of searching for something and exploring the city to try to find that something. I've done that. Mission accomplished. I've got the glasses. So in this shift in tone, I'm going to embrace the people that ask me for selfies and the people that said hi to me, try to make a look, a little scene out of that, and then use that as my bridge to come back to the studio. So this is like taking it away from sort of the music video montage-y part of the movie and getting into something a little bit more human. Plus, I feel like having lost all of that dialogue because I forgot to have the microphone on, I need to make up for that by leaning more into dialogue for this sequence. You okay? Not yet. Not yet. All right. I miss this city, though. Nice. We miss you, too. Oh, my God. Dude, can I get a picture with you? Yeah, totally. Yeah, you're on my vlog. Oh, hey! Bye, guys! It's hard to see that without smiling. It's the success. I've got the glasses. I'm like meeting all these fun people. Everybody's happy. Now I got to make it stop. Now we got to like, this is over. Time for act two. Bye, guys! This is the end of the show. I'm going to go get my glasses. I'm going to go get my glasses. I'm going to go get my glasses. I'm going to go get my glasses. I'm going to go get my glasses. I'm going to go get my glasses. Time for act two. Bye, guys! This is the shot. I could definitely have filmed myself pulling up from the studio. I could have filmed myself like walking into the front door and going up the steps, the whole thing. But this is, there's an opportunity here. That opportunity was to acknowledge fixing this monitor, which was the whole intro of the movie. And the way I did that was just by filming it. Filming the monitor and having me enter frame via the monitor. It looked like this. This is the shot. I'm accentuating the bag. And I come in. And then this is the wide of that shot. Well, that was an adventure, wasn't it? It totally works. Okay. Let me build that in. Bye, guys! Bye, guys! Bye, guys! Bye, guys! Bye, guys! Bye, guys! Bye, guys! Bye, guys! So, it works. I did put one little kind of nothing in there, which is after these girls say hi, I put this shot of me skateboarding. It's a throwaway shot. It's 19 frames long. So, it's two-thirds of one second. Not even a full second long. But I don't know. When it comes to tempo and pacing, like sometimes you just need like a period at the end of a sentence. And that's sort of what this is. Okay. Right here, as I come in, I wish I had like the door going . Like I need a noise to end the song on. Song's over. It works. It's a nice, easy little cheat. I don't have like a bang. I don't have a door opening. So, I'm using my voice when I get back in the studio. I think it plays. Girls saying hi. Period. At the end of the sentence. I'm approaching. From the beginning of the movie. Well, that was an adventure. I think it works. Well, that was an adventure, wasn't it? All right. This shot is ending with me walking across the space, bag in hand. The very next shot is going to be the overhead shot looking down in the glasses for the unpacking. That action is sort of our bridge to act two. The next sequence here is me taking the glasses out and scratching at them. And painting them and making them mine. And that whole sequence clashes with this sequence. This sequence is about being outside the city. The adventure of it all. The next one is literally shot in a desktop this big. And it's about the glasses themselves. It's about the subject. The subject being the glasses. And it really focuses on that. So, with that, it's me physically placing them down that sort of bridges the two. I think. This is me. Look, I'm back where I started. I'm no longer running around. Well, that was an adventure, wasn't it? I've got them. Now we're going into a different storyline. Something new is picking up here. This is different. And that feels like a good place to stop this lesson. So, before I do, I want to talk a little bit about act one. And maybe give you some things to be thinking about as you start to put together your act one of your video. First is the intro. Those first couple of shots are the way you pull your audience in. You don't have to explain the whole movie in the first shot. You almost never need to do that. You don't have to explain everything. All you need to do is let the viewer know a little bit of sort of the tone, the emotion, the theme of this video. And engage them and get them excited enough to want to come along for the ride. That's the goal of the intro. Once that's been established, then it's a little bit of like a let's go. And you're using your entire first act to set up what your story is. It's diversified as my first act was. I'm in the studio. I'm doing the intro. I'm fixing the thing. I'm talking to camera. I'm getting on my skateboard. I'm being turned on. I'm exploring the city. All of that was teeing up my subject, which are these glasses, which will be the next act. That's all all of this did as far as the story. I hope that's helpful. Good luck. I'll see you at the next lesson.",

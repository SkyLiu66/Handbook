Therefore, if creating a post takes three hours, at least one to two hours should be dedicated to deciding the topic. A well-chosen topic can significantly enhance the effectiveness of your content. To find a good topic, consider the pain points of your target audience. For example, if you are a fitness coach, topics could include fitness routines, gym equipment, or workout plans. By focusing on specific pain points and addressing them in your content, you can create posts that resonate with your audience and drive higher engagement."

To find hot topics, you can use platforms like Weibo to check the latest trending topics or Xiaohongshu's 'Discover' section. Once you identify a hot topic, create content that relates to it from multiple angles. For instance, if a particular skincare product is trending, you could create posts recommending similar products or discussing the benefits of the trending product. By aligning your content with hot topics, you can attract more views and interactions."

By replicating these successful strategies, you can improve the quality of your own content and increase your chances of success. This approach not only saves time but also helps you avoid common pitfalls and focus on proven methods."

I wanted to give you an example of if you don't have an artificial lighting source, you don't have any external lighting, or you wanted to do something that maybe looked a little bit more casual and a little bit less produced, using natural light is perfect for that kind of scenario. So what we're going to be doing is taking a look in this situation to find where we can A, find a really good source of natural light coming through a window, coming through a doorway. And then we're also going to, of course, use proper focal length, proper framing, but more importantly, we're going to use exposure, contrast, and separation from our subject to the background to really create an image that looks good because we don't have a rim light or a hair light. And we don't have bright artificial light to really make it look good. So with that said, we're going to take Kimberlea and we're going to choose a backdrop and then we're going to set everything up with the proper settings. So what we're going to do is actually take this area of the house and turn this into the setup. So right now it doesn't really look like much, but what we're going to do is open up this door. This is a huge natural diffuse lighting scenario because we're not getting direct light from the sun that would create harsh shadows. We have the sun bouncing off white walls. We have the sun bouncing off the fence, which is going to be perfect for getting really soft looking natural light. So the next thing that we're going to do is look at the direction that we're going to be filming because this is our main lighting source. We want to have our subject obviously facing that main source, but we want to keep in mind what is going to be in the background. So what I'm going to do is I want to set up this camera. Bada boom. So I'm going to go ahead and hit record on this camera to see what we're working with here with the backdrop. Of course for this scenario, I would generally have a little bit more of a minimal background, but for something that's really easy and if you guys want to pull out the camera to film a video at your house. We're for this. We're focusing more on getting a good lighting setup and how to really use natural light. Don't focus too much on the background for this kind of scenario. So now that I know where I want to shoot because we have this really nice natural lighting setup. We're going to do a before shot before we go into making the footage actually look good. So here's Kimberley up in we're not paying attention to setting a good focal length where our exposure is off and really the lighting is just not good. So we're going to start from scratch and really build this up to a really good before and a really good after and now first step. We are opening the door and not hitting the wall. Perfect. So now we have a really good natural light source and we're shooting at 24 frames a second and we're going to move our shutter speed up to 150th. So we're doubling the speed of our frame rate. That's going to give us a really nice natural motion blur. Now the other thing that I'm going to do is open up our aperture. All the way because we don't have any external lighting. It's going to be really important to have a shallow depth of field to make this image look as good as possible. So I'm going to open up all the way and I'm going to zoom in a little bit. Kimberly you can step forward. Yep. Okay. And I'm going to raise the camera up. This is going to be her new style of shooting. She's going to always be standing in her future videos. So check out her YouTube channel for that. Okay so this is looking pretty good already. Our white balance is already set pretty good but let's just check if we move it up just a little bit. So our Kelvin rating temperature is going to be at 5000 and that's looking pretty good. Okay.",

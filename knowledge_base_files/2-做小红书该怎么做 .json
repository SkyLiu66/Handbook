Unlike other e-commerce platforms, Xiaohongshu does not require sellers to purchase inventory upfront or pay for traffic. The platform's store setup is also cost-effective, with most categories requiring only a small deposit, which can be deferred until the seller starts making sales. Additionally, Xiaohongshu operates on a T+7 payment cycle, meaning funds are available seven days after the customer confirms receipt of the goods. This quick turnaround reduces the financial strain on sellers. The platform's rules are also lenient, with few penalties for minor infractions. Most issues are resolved with simple corrections rather than fines. This low-risk environment makes Xiaohongshu an attractive option for new entrepreneurs and those looking to expand their e-commerce presence without significant upfront costs."

        "Content": "Xiaohongshu supports a no-inventory business model, which is ideal for new sellers. In this model, sellers list products on Xiaohongshu without holding any stock. When a customer places an order, the seller purchases the product from a supplier, such as 1688 or Pinduoduo, and has it shipped directly to the customer. This approach eliminates the need for upfront inventory investment and reduces the risk of unsold stock. Sellers can focus on marketing and customer service without worrying about warehousing and logistics. The profit comes from the difference between the supplier's price and the selling price on Xiaohongshu. This model is particularly beneficial for those with limited capital or those looking to test new products without significant financial commitment. By leveraging this model, sellers can efficiently manage their cash flow and scale their business based on demand."

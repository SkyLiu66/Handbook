        "Content": "Editing videos for product promotion on Xiaohongshu involves several key steps to ensure the final video is engaging and effective. First, use a video editing software like Jianying. Open the software and select a suitable template. When choosing a template, ensure it is not too long and does not have too many elements. The music should be calm and match the platform's tone. Once you have selected a template, insert your images into the video. If you have a VIP subscription, you can unlock more features, but even without it, you can still edit effectively. Adjust the video's aspect ratio to 3:4, which is the recommended ratio for Xiaohongshu. Trim the video to the desired length, usually around 6-7 seconds, by splitting and deleting unnecessary parts. Next, adjust the composition of your images to make them look more appealing. This includes zooming in or out and positioning the images to highlight the product. Finally, apply filters to enhance the visual appeal of the video. Use the adjustment tools to tweak the brightness, contrast, and color balance. Once satisfied, export the video and upload it to Xiaohongshu for promotion."

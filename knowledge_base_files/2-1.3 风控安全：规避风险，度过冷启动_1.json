        "Content": "Xiaohongshu has specific control and safety mechanisms in place to ensure the platform's integrity and security. When starting a new account, users often experience a 'cold start' period where their content may not receive significant visibility. This is a normal phase where the platform is assessing the new account and its content. During this period, the system is trying to understand the creator's tags and match them with the appropriate audience. It's crucial to be patient and not lose confidence if initial posts do not gain much traction. The platform's algorithms need time to accurately categorize and promote the content. Understanding these mechanisms helps users navigate the initial stages without resorting to prohibited activities like mutual following or artificially inflating likes and followers, which can lead to account penalties."

        "Content": "During the cold start period on Xiaohongshu, there are specific actions users should and should not take to ensure their account's growth and safety. Firstly, avoid engaging in mutual following or mutual assistance activities, as these can lead to the account being flagged for irregular behavior. Secondly, do not buy followers or likes, as this is considered blatant cheating and can result in severe penalties, including account suspension. Instead, focus on creating high-quality content that genuinely engages the audience. It's also important not to rush the process by posting low-quality content in bulk. Quality should always take precedence over quantity. Additionally, refrain from registering multiple accounts from the same IP address, as the platform can detect and penalize such behavior. During this period, users should use their account normally, engaging with content and making purchases, to help the platform accurately identify their interests and creator tags."

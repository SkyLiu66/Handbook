    "Content": "1. When setting boundaries for your child, it's important to differentiate between necessary restrictions for safety and asserting dominance. Ensure that your 'no's are backed by good reasons that contribute to your child's development and safety. 2. Avoid power struggles by self-reflecting on your motivations behind decisions. Consider whether your actions are driven by love and respect or by ego and insecurity. 3. Encourage autonomy within healthy boundaries to foster self-leadership in children. 4. Intervene in situations as an authority figure with the intention of promoting safety and respect, not to win arbitrary power struggles. 5. Parenting is a continuous learning process, and it's okay to seek advice and support from communities like Discord to enhance your understanding and approach."

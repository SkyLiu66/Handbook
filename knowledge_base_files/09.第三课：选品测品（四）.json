        "Content": "The benchmarking method involves analyzing successful competitors to identify potential products for your store. This method is particularly effective for identifying trending products in competitive markets. Start by selecting a few successful stores in your niche and monitor their new product releases and bestsellers. Focus on stores that frequently update their inventory and have multiple best-selling items. This indicates a high turnover and a good understanding of market trends. Avoid stores that only sell a single product or have low sales volumes, as they may not provide valuable insights. By following this method, you can quickly identify products with high demand and replicate their success in your store."

This method is useful when you have no specific product ideas and need inspiration. Start by browsing the main categories on Taobao's homepage and drill down into subcategories. Look for products that are popular but not overly saturated. Pay attention to niche products that have a steady demand but fewer competitors. For example, within the 'Toys' category, you might find specific educational toys that are trending. This method allows you to uncover unique products that can differentiate your store from competitors. It requires thorough research and a keen eye for emerging trends."

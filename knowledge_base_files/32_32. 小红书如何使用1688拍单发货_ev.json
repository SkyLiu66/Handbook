        "Content": "No-inventory shipping, also known as dropshipping, is a business model where you do not keep products in stock. Instead, you list products from other platforms on your store. When a customer places an order, you purchase the product from the original platform and have it shipped directly to the customer. This method eliminates the need for inventory management and reduces upfront costs. However, platforms like Xiaohongshu and Douyin have strict rules against cross-platform dropshipping to protect their interests. They prohibit using customer information from their platforms to place orders on others like Pinduoduo or Taobao. Instead, you should use platforms like 1688, which are designed for direct factory shipments. This ensures compliance with platform rules and maintains product quality. By understanding and adhering to these guidelines, you can effectively manage a no-inventory shipping business without violating platform policies."

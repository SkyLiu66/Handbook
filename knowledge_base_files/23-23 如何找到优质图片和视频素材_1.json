        "Content": "To find high-quality images for marketing, you can use platforms like Taobao. Start by taking a screenshot of the product you want to market, then use the image search feature on Taobao. This will help you find similar products. Navigate to the product's review section, as it often contains user-generated content that is more authentic and visually appealing. Look for images that do not show faces or brand logos to avoid copyright issues. Save these images for your marketing materials. Be cautious with images that are too revealing, especially for sensitive products like lingerie, as they may violate platform guidelines. Always ensure that the images you choose are relevant and high-quality to maintain a professional appearance in your marketing efforts."

        "Content": "To source videos for marketing, platforms like Douyin (TikTok) are excellent resources. Search for the product you are marketing and look for videos that do not feature people or brand logos prominently. These videos are more likely to be reusable without violating copyright laws. Once you find a suitable video, use tools like 'Chuangzuomao' to remove watermarks. This tool is user-friendly and allows you to download videos without watermarks for free. After downloading, you can edit and repurpose these videos for your marketing campaigns. Avoid using videos that feature influencers or brand endorsements, as these are often protected by copyright. Instead, focus on generic product demonstrations or user-generated content that can be easily adapted to your marketing needs."

        "Content": "When using sourced content for marketing, it is crucial to follow best practices to avoid legal issues and maintain quality. First, never use content directly from platforms like Xiaohongshu without modification. Always edit and customize the content to fit your brand and message. This can include adding your logo, changing the background, or altering the text. Second, avoid using content that features recognizable faces or brand logos unless you have explicit permission. This helps prevent copyright infringement. Third, if you must use content from a specific platform, consider blocking the original creator's account to avoid detection. Lastly, always aim to source content from multiple platforms to diversify your materials and reduce the risk of over-reliance on a single source. By following these best practices, you can effectively use sourced content while minimizing legal risks and maintaining a professional image."

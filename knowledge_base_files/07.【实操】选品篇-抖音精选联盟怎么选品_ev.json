For example, if you want to buy tissues, add them to your selection cart and then to your showcase. Once added, you can purchase the products directly from your showcase. After purchasing, you will earn a commission, which can later be withdrawn from the 'My Commission' section. This method allows you to earn a commission on any product you buy from the selection plaza, making it a convenient way to save money on personal purchases."
